In many respects, Australian boards more closely approach normative "best practice" guidelines for corporate governance than boards in other Western countries. Do Australian firms then demonstrate a board demographic-organisational performance link that has not been found in other economies? We examine the relationships between board demographics and corporate performance in 348 of Australia's largest publicly listed companies and describe the attributes of these firms and their boards. We find that, after controlling for firm size, board size is positively correlated with firm value. We also find a positive relationship between the proportion of inside directors and the market-based measure of firm performance. We discuss the implications of these findings and compare our findings to prevailing research in the US and the UK.

The control role of the Board of Directors is aimed at monitoring the decisions and actions undertaken by managers in order to protect stockholders' interests. Considerable theoretical and empirical research has analyzed whether directors' behavior is consistent with their fiduciary responsibility, but this research has reported inconsistent findings. This paper offers a comprehensive review of both theoretical and empirical literature on the control role of the board and suggests several guidelines for future research. (c) 2003 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

Boards of directors are governance bodies that serve important functions for organizations, ranging from monitoring management on behalf of different shareholders to providing resources. Board roles and characteristics vary widely among national cultures and, within each country, among different company types. Despite such variety, research on family business boards has been dominated by prescriptions and by the lack of an explicit recognition of family firm types characterized by different governance requirements. We argue that a contingency approach to defining board structure, activity, and roles offers useful guidance in understanding board contributions to family business performance. We develop a theory to show how board characteristics are a reflection of a family firm's power, experience, and culture makeup. This theory provides insight into descriptions of existing board choices and prescriptions for family firms interested in starting or adapting their board of directors. (c) 2004, SAGE Publications.

The role of the board of directors in firm strategy has long been the subject of debate. However, research efforts have suffered from several deficiencies: the lack of an overarching theoretical perspective, reliance on proxies for the strategy role rather than a direct measure of it and the lack of quantitative data linking this role to firm financial performance. We propose a new theoretical perspective to explain the board's role in strategy, integrating organisational control and agency theories. We categorise a board's approach to strategy according to two constructs: strategic control and financial control. The extent to which either construct is favoured depends on contextual factors such as board power, environmental uncertainty and information asymmetry.

This paper advances the resource dependence and social networks literature by investigating a board's structural social capital created as a consequence of interlocking directorates. Using approaches and measures developed by social network analysis we compare the interpersonal directorship networks of the top 250 companies in the United States and Australia. We find that the smaller, sparser Australian network is only marginally less compact and connected than the larger US network at the firm level of analysis. However, at the director level of analysis the US network is much larger and more connected than its Australian counterpart. As a result, we argue that scholars studying the resource dependence role of boards should consider using measures of interpersonal links as well as traditional measures of inter-firm links. Understanding how boards impact on corporate performance is a question central to the corporate governance research agenda. Agency theory, for example, argues that the key way a board adds value is by ensuring the interests of the managers of the firm are aligned with the interests of the owners (Eisenhardt 1989; Jensen & Meckling 1976). A quite distinct area of inquiry, however, relates to the role that the board plays in providing access to important resources such as customers (Pennings 1980), capital (Mizruchi & Stearns 1988), the business elite (Uscem 1984) and power in general (Pfeffer & Salancik 1978). We aim to broaden understanding of the resource dependence theory of corporate governance by examining the links provided to a board by interlocking directorships. We commence by reviewing existing research on the resource dependence role of the board before outlining how the emerging construct of social capital can be adapted and applied to investigate this role. In particular, we highlight how it is the personal director network that is critical to the development of social capital rather than the corporate network (i.e. network of corporations). While this study is primarily exploratory and descriptive, we contribute to the literature by employing a new methodology to measure the 'opportunity network' that interlocking directorates provide a board within a national corporate governance system (Adams 2002a; 2002b; 2002c). We show how the formal models, procedures and techniques developed in social network analysis can be applied to individual-level networks among directors. We stress that we are not considering the formation of social capital at the individual level; rather we are examining the systemic connections of individual directors in order to illustrate the opportunity network available to a board within the national corporate governance system. A comparison of the Australian and US systems highlights the divergence in network attributes between corporate networks and the networks of interlocking directors. We conclude with implications and areas for further research.

This paper examines board effectiveness through an examination of the work and relationships of non-executive directors. It is based on 40 in-depth interviews with company directors, commissioned for the Higgs Review. The paper observes that research on corporate governance lacks understanding of the behavioural processes and effects of boards of directors. Whilst board structure, composition and independence condition board effectiveness it is the actual conduct of the non-executive vis-a-vis the executive that determines board effectiveness. Data about behaviour and relationships on boards suggest that traditional theoretical divisions between agency and stewardship theory, and control versus collaboration models of the board do not adequately reflect the lived experience of non-executive directors and other directors on the board. Developing accountability as a central concept in the explanation of how boards operate effectively enables the paper to both challenge the dominant grip of agency theory on governance research and support the search for theoretical pluralism and greater understanding of board processes and dynamics. Practically, the work suggests that corporate governance reform will be undermined by prescription that supports distant perceptions of board effectiveness but not the actual effectiveness of boards.

We test the effects of stakeholder management on CEOs' salaries, bonuses, stock options, and total compensation. We also examine the extent to which the interaction of stakeholder management and financial performance determines compensation. Using a longitudinal database of 406 Fortune 1000 firms, our results suggest that stakeholder management is relevant to boards of directors when setting CEO compensation. Specifically, we found a significant, negative main effect of stakeholder management on CEO salaries. Further, we found that stakeholder management typically reduces the rewards CEOs may get for increasing levels of financial performance. In tandem, these results indicate that CEOs may jeopardize their personal wealth by pursuing stakeholder-related initiatives. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A post-Enron consensus on corporate governance has emerged among investor groups, government regulators, and the private exchanges. The corporate board should function principally as a shareholder oversight body. To ensure independence from management, the board should have a substantial majority of independent, outside directors, who neither have business relationships with the firm nor social relationships with management. These reforms may decrease the probability for director complicity in managerial malfeasance. However, research has not demonstrated a relationship between board independence and firm performance. Corporate governance looks quite different when the firm is considered as a cooperative team to produce new wealth. From this "production" perspective, corporate governance recommendations differ substantially from recent reforms. Rather than have directors solely represent shareholder interests, boards should represent those stakeholders that add value, assume unique risk, and possess strategic information. Rather than restrict insiders to one or two, boards should include a group of employees (managers and workers,) who bring the firm's know-how to the table. The team production model for corporate governance has far-reaching implications. The recommendations derived from our model suggest that the latest reform proposals offered by the New York Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission create a board of directors that does not adequately consider the firm's new wealth-producing capabilities. This, we argue, accounts for the missing positive link between board independence and firm performance. (c) Academy of Management Executive.

Good governance for SMEs is critical for economic development and growth in both developed and developing economies. In this paper we focus on boards and governance in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) by investigating the role and contribution of "outside" directors in this setting. By contrasting board role theories against different types of SMEs, firms are expected to recruit "outside" board members for various reasons. Illustrated by 52 empirical studies of "outside" directors in SMEs we show how agency theory, resource based view of the firm, and resource dependence theory can be applied to understand the multiple roles that "outside" directors can play in family firms, venture capital-backed firms and other SMEs. The illustration shows that the concept "outside" director is not the same in different theories and in different empirical settings. Based on this finding, we argue for the need to have a conscious and balanced use of theories for understanding the role and contribution of "outside" directors in SMEs.

Affirmative action and diversity continue to be contentious issues in the United States. Financial markets are still reeling from the effects of Enron, WorldCom and other corporate exemplars of corruption and malfeasance. The role of the board of directors in these scandals is the subject of serious and ongoing concern. Weak and/or ineffectual boards are often the consequences of "old-boy networks" and a lack of diversity in membership. This research study argues for an increased presence of gender and race diversity on boards of directors. Empirical evidence is presented that shows a significant increase in the presence of ethnic minorities and females when pictures of board members are included in annual reports. We suggest that requiring pictures of board members in annual reports and regulatory filings would result in a larger presence for gender and race diversity on boards of directors. This requirement is not a significant burden and merely represents compliance with the spirit and intent of the "full disclosure" principle. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Crises in corporate accountability have prompted calls for boards of directors to monitor (i.e., oversee) top management teams (TMTs) more closely and become more involved in strategic decision making. Research on board processes has focused largely on the benefits of these board behaviors, with little attention paid to possible negative consequences. This study addresses that gap by examining the impact of board monitoring and involvement on affective conflict within the top management team. We find that board montoring and involvement interact with TMT power such that more powerful teams suffer less affective conflict when the board monitors their activities, but greater affective conflict when the board becomes involved in the firm's strategic decision-making process.

This study examined the relationship between top management team (TMT) tenure and certain types of illegal activity within manufacturing and retail firms, and the moderating influence of board size on this relationship. Using a sample of 221 Fortune 500 firms for the 1998-2002 time period, the results support a positive link between long TMT tenure and the incidence of "serious," "willful," and "repeat" OSHA and EPA violations occurring within the sample firms. Further, the results suggest that the number of illegal violations is significantly reduced among those firms having larger boards of directors. Thus, the results offer support for the notion that larger boards may be more effective than smaller boards in carrying out the management oversight function.

This study, based on a comparison of the Combined Code Guidelines for non-executive directors between listed and unlisted boards, suggests that on unlisted boards non-executive directors have a greater degree of involvement in strategic development, financial monitoring, shareholder communication and overall board contribution than on listed boards, but a lesser degree of involvement in the monitoring of management, the setting of executive remuneration, the appointment and removal of executives, and succession planning. The importance of risk analysis and induction is considered high across both sectors, although board development and independence is considered less important on unlisted boards.

Traditionally, corporate governance has focused on the problem of crafting mechanisms to align the interests of owners and managers. The key characteristic has been to minimize the potential for managers to act in their own self-interest at the expense of shareholders. The purpose of this paper is to focus on employees as stakeholders in the governance process. We argue that creating an environment where employees have help in behaving ethically, in the course of their work, is the first step in encouraging them to voice observations of wrongdoing. Seven groups of professionals in the accounting and insurance fields were surveyed during a 10-year period and asked to indicate the extent to which 14 items were helpful in dealing with ethical challenges. Over 2700 responses were analyzed. The findings indicate that professionals think that their organizational culture and policy for voice was more helpful in dealing with ethical dilemmas than was their professional association.

This paper first describes the complex Dutch corporate governance system and the functioning of the Supervisory Board under the rules of the structure regime and co-option model up to the present time. The critiques of the parties and stakeholders involved in this model are investigated next, followed by a description and explanation of the recent developments of the Dutch model and a discussion of the pros and cons of the alternatives with regard to the interests of the various stakeholders. Finally, some key factors for improving the boards' functioning in the - changing - Dutch corporate governance system are presented. The findings and recommendations are based on case-studies and interviews conducted in large Dutch companies over several years and on extensive analyses of documents and recent evolutions. This research method however, is only suitable for a process of exploration, clarification and development of hypotheses.

The extant literature on CEO succession has paid significant attention to the organizational outcomes of CEO successions such as strategic change and firm performance. Few studies, however, have explicitly examined the personal outcomes of the newly selected CEOs. In this study, we examined how successions contexts may influence the likelihood that a new CEO is dismissed within three years after succession, namely, "new CEO dismissal." Based upon agency theory and human capital theory, we argue that new CEO dismissal may represent a correction to an inappropriate CEO selection and accordingly, succession contexts that tend to lead to an inappropriate CEO selection will increase the likelihood of new CEO dismissal. With a sample of 204 CEO successions in the time period of 1993-1998, we find that the origin of the new CEO and the characteristics of the board of directors at the succession time have significant impact on the likelihood of new CEO dismissal.

This paper examines why firms differ in levels of R&D investment intensity by developing and testing a theory of direct and interaction effects of top management team and board outsider composition on R&D intensity. The theory is tested in a longitudinal sample of technology-intensive firms that completed an initial public offering. The results indicate that both top management team composition and board composition have direct and additive effects on R&D investment intensity. Also, monitoring by outsider directors does not constitute a universally effective governance mechanism with regard to a firm's R&D investment strategy. Firms opt for lower levels of R&D investment intensity when their outsider-rich board interacts with a team of managers who have high levels of (1) firm tenure, (2) shared team-specific experience, or (3) functional heterogeneity. When a firm's competitiveness relies on sustained R&D investments, it is important to note these interaction effects and make adjustments to promote a healthy dialogue between managers and the board. Adjustments could be made to the management team composition (e.g., initiating management turnover to reduce firm tenure) or to the bundle of governance mechanisms (e.g., partially substituting board monitoring with other mechanisms).

Purpose - The objective of this article is to examine and conceptualise gender-related boardroom dynamics that affect how women can make contributions on corporate boards. Design/methodology/approach - Stories were collected from eight women directors about their experiences from more than 100 corporate boards. Narrative methods were used in the data analysis. Findings - Women as well as men need to understand the power game inside and outside the boardroom. Their contribution depends on the ability and willingness to make alliances with the most influential actors, to spend time on preparations, being present on the most important decision-making arenas, and to take leadership roles. Practical implications - The study has implications for theory as well as practice. Process-oriented theories should be included in studies of boards and governance, and the study showed that boardroom dynamics are not neutral to gender. Concepts and relationships are suggested that should be included in further theory development. The study has also given several practical examples and suggestions on how women can make contributions on corporate boards. Originality/value - The study has value for developing the role of women directors. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The board of directors is regarded as one of the most imperative governance mechanisms in small and medium-sized family firms. Empirical studies examining both the roles these boards fulfil in a family business context, as well as evaluating the CEO's perceived importance of these roles, are scarce. Founded by a range of conceptual and multi-theoretical board role definitions, this paper contributes to the literature by empirically determining board roles. Furthermore, the importance of these board roles and differences between the board's performance and perceived importance are assessed. The results show it is indispensable to differentiate between two aggregated roles that boards in small and medium-sized family firms perform: control and service. The control role is predominantly based on agency theory, whereas the service role includes multiple theoretical perspectives. The CEOs of the family firms perceive the service role of the board as most important. However, in order to direct succession and to compensate for the owner/manager's altruistic behaviour, the board's control role should not be neglected. The acknowledgement of these two aggregated board roles and their importance may enhance future research on board roles within specific contexts. (c) 2006 Blaekwell Publishing Ltd.

Governance reform of publicly held corporations is an important topic these days, but a critical subtext has been missing from this often searing debate. Namely, what is the significance of these governance reforms, de jure and de facto, for the publicly held corporation's distant, smaller, but economically robust brethren - namely, the closely held, family-owned business? Should these family-owned entities be held to the same governance guidelines and standards that apply to those firms making up the ranks of the Fortune 500, for example? To put it another way, does one size fit all? We caution that many of the most popularized corporate governance practices may be detrimental to family businesses. Many of these recommendations may harm family unity or might be too complex for private firms, and many are applicable only to very large, public companies with dispersed ownership. Popular corporate governance practices are focused toward a market model of corporate governance, found prevalently in the United States and United Kingdom, which involves companies with a widely dispersed shareholder base and a majority of independent, outside board members. In contrast, the typical family-owned business exhibits characteristics of the control model of corporate governance, found prevalently in continental Europe, Latin America, and Asia, which involves companies with a concentrated shareholder base and family member "insiders" active in management and the board. As a result of these differences, many of the new laws and recommendations may actually be harmful to family-owned businesses. (c) 2006 Family Firm Institute, Inc.

How many directorships are too many? Globally, normative advice emphasises the importance of limiting the number of directorships any individual should hold due to the workloads they entail. However, there is little empirical evidence to support this view. Rather, there is a strong tradition of supporting multiple directorships as a mechanism for the firm to co-opt external resources. To explore the issue of director workloads and multiple directorships, we first consider the issues related to multiple directorships and outline the conclusions of extant international and Australian studies into multiple directorships. We then detail our objectives in undertaking this research and our approach to data collection. Our findings indicate that the incidence of multiple directorships in Australian listed companies is low. We also find that many of the apparent examples of multiple directorships are due to related entities, which share common directors and, due to the nature of these entities, have much lower workload requirements. Further, there does not appear to be any relationship between holding multiple directorships and firm financial performance. Finally, we discuss the implications for boards and those interested in governance, particularly the need to ensure governance recommendations and guidelines reflect empirical findings. We offer one solution to address the concerns of boards, investors, other stakeholders and the community regarding multiple directorships: board and individual director evaluations.

This study examines relationships between the existence of boards of directors and advisory boards and the use of planning in family businesses. It is argued that both of the primary roles of boards, the governance of a firm's management team for the firm's stakeholders and the provision of valuable business resources to the firm's management team, are significantly related to the use of planning activities in family businesses. The empirical evidence, drawn from a survey of more than 130 family businesses, largely supports the hypotheses. Conclusions and suggestions for future research close the article.

Over the last few years corporate governance codes and shareholder expectations have increased the need for boards of directors to demonstrate effective leadership, quality decision-making processes and the ability to exercise corporate controls. Shareholders and stakeholders continue to focus on indicators such board structure, composition and nonexecutive independence as proxies for effectiveness, often without an increased understanding of the environment in which boards of directors make decisions, or the behaviour and dynamics of individuals. In order specifically to address this issue the Combined Code, published in 2003, stated that a board should undertake annually "a formal and rigorous evaluation of its own performance, that of the committees and individual directors" (Financial Reporting Council, 2003, p. 10. The Combined Code on Corporate Governance. London: Financial Reporting Council), although it omitted to give formal guidance on evaluation methods, or the disclosure of outcomes to shareholders. This paper draws on earlier research (Long, 2004) in order to contribute to an improved understanding of the role and effectiveness of board evaluation, and to add to the policy debate by identifying board dynamics which influence the environment in which boards operate. It suggests that the evaluation process should interpret specific influences on the environment in which boards make their decisions - company lifecycle, corporate structure, board culture and embedded process - highlighting distinct board roles and responsibilities, and diverse levels of individual approach, expectation and contribution. The author draws on her work through Boardroom Review to explore ways in which board evaluation can achieve a range of corporate objectives which extend beyond compliance, and encourages boards and their chairmen to adopt a thoughtful and thorough approach to this year's evaluation model.

This study examined relationships between the number of female board members, board tenure, and board size on the number of 10K investigations that were instigated against firms in the basic materials and financial services sectors of the economy. After controlling for the effects of firm size, we found evidence of an interaction effect between the number of female directors and average board tenure for firms in the financial services sector, such that a higher number of women on boards coupled with longer average board tenure results in higher firm social performance (i.e., the fewer the number of 10K investigations brought against the firm). No link was found between female directors and average board tenure for the basic materials firms. Further, no interactive patterns were observed between female directors and board size in either sector. Our findings suggest that future board research may benefit from a "contingency approach, " as this study has provided some evidence that the relationships between board characteristics and firm performance may not be generalizable from one sector to another. Future research should carefully consider how the sector or industry may affect the impact of board characteristics on firm performance.

This study aims to investigate the moderating effect of the board chair's role on the relationship between board human capital and firm performance. Board human capital has been regarded as a valuable asset that enhances firm performance. Especially, the board chair plays a crucial role in developing this high-echelon human capital. This study utilises a set of longitudinal data to examine 275 firms in Taiwan. The result indicates that board human capital is positively related to firm performance, and the individual human capital of the board chair represents a moderating effect on the relationship between board human capital and performance.

Despite a large body of research in the management, accounting, economics, and finance literatures, the relationship between board composition and firm performance is still controversial and ripe for debate (for a recent study, see Boone et al., 2004). Utilizing the theoretical approach of Zahra and Pearce (1989) that identifies the three key roles of the board as oversight, strategy, and service, we examine the effects of having board interlocks between an industrial firm and of financial services firm, and firm characteristics. Using publicly available data on all listed Italian firms for the year 2001, we find that for industrial firms, there is a positive relationship between the number of board interlocks with a bank and current year return on assets, however, the opposite is true for financial services firms. Finally, we find no relationship between interlocking directorates with banks and firm capital structure.

Women are increasing in number among corporations' boards of directors, yet their representation is far from uniform across firms. In this study, we adopted a resource dependence theory lens to identify organizational predictors of women on boards. We tested our hypotheses using panel data from the 1,000 U.S. firms that were largest in terms of sales between 1990 and 2003. We found that organizational size, industry type, firm diversification strategy, and network effects (linkages to other boards with women directors) significantly impact the likelihood of female representation on boards of directors.

The board of directors is one of a number of internal governance mechanisms that are intended to ensure that the interests of shareholders and managers are closely aligned, and to discipline or remove ineffective management teams. Among the most significant governance issues currently faced by the modern corporation are those relating to diversity, such as gender and age, and independence of directors. While board diversity and independence has been a growing area of research in recent years, most empirical research on this topic has been restricted to US data. The generalisability of such findings may not extend across national boundaries due to different regulatory and economic environments, cultural differences, the size of capital markets and the effectiveness of governance mechanisms. Consequently, the importance and value of various governance structures, including board diversity and independence, should be separately examined in each country, and the influential factors investigated. This study reports on the diversity and independence of the board membership of 100 top Australian companies in 2003. Australia has one of the most developed stock markets in the Asia-Pacific region. With the collapse of several well-known public companies such as Ansett, OneTel and HIH, there is an increasing demand to evaluate the corporate governance practices of Australian companies, including the composition of boards. Accordingly, this research provides a timely review of the state of corporate governance in Australia so far as board composition is concerned. (c) 2007 The Authors.

We examine hypothesised links between the board of directors and firm performance as predicted by the three predominant theories in corporate governance research, namely agency theory, stewardship theory and resource dependence theory. By employing a pattern matching analysis of seven cases, we are able to examine the hypothesised link between board demography and firm performance expected under each theory. We find that while each theory can explain a particular case, no single theory explains the general pattern of results. We conclude by endorsing recent calls for a more process-orientated approach to both theory and empirical analysis if we are to understand how boards add value. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This study examines the presence and roles of female directors of U.S. Fortune 500 firms, focusing on committee assignments and director background. Prior work from almost two decades ago concludes that there is a systematic bias against females in assignment to top board committees. Examining a recent data set with a logistic regression model that controls for director and firm characteristics, director resource-dependence roles and interaction between director gender and director characteristics, we find that female directors are less likely than male directors to sit on executive committees and more likely than male directors to sit on public affairs committees. There is little if any evidence of systematic gender bias in director assignment to other board committees. We find some evidence that boards evaluate resource dependence differently for women than men. (c) Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.

Prior studies of the relationship between the composition of boards of directors and firm performance offer equivocal results. Drawing on agency and power circulation theories, we attempt to reduce this equivocality by asserting that CEO power moderates the relationship. Specifically, an outside director dominated board is needed to check a powerful CEO, but monitoring by other executives provides sufficient constraints on CEOs with low power. We used event study methodology to test the effects of the interaction between board composition and CEO power on stock market reaction to 73 unexpected CEO deaths. We found support for our theorizing among two of three sources of CEO power. Thus, although regulatory trends increasingly support outside director dominated boards, our findings indicate that this may not always benefit shareholders and that CEO power should be considered when constructing boards.

In this paper we analyse boards of directors as workgroups, i.e. groups of people that perform one or more tasks within an organisational context. Building on previous studies, we developed a model that relates group's social-psychological processes to three different board tasks: service, monitoring and networking. We tested our model through a survey on 301 large manufacturing firms in Italy. Our findings support the idea that (a) process variables and, to a limited extent, demographic variables significantly influence board task performance; (b) board processes have a different impact on each specific board task; (c) board task performance varies depending upon firm and industry characteristics.

This paper examines the relationship between firm complexity and board of director composition. Utilising the board typology of Baysinger and Zardkoohi (1986), we classify board members either as insiders, business experts, support specialists, or community influentials, and examine board composition in relation to firm internal and external complexity. Internal complexity refers to the sophistication of internal work processes (proxied by firm R&D expenditures, and the amount of invested capital), while external complexity relates to the external competitive structure (proxied by the number of business and geographic segments, and industrial leadership). Utilising a random sample of 150 firms drawn from six industries over the 2003-2005 time period, and after classifying 4,408 directors to one of our board categories, multivariate results confirm conjectures that complexity is related to the specific capabilities that each board member brings to the firm. We find that externally complex firms substitute community influentials for insiders. Additionally, internally complex firms have lower levels of community influentials, which are substituted by insiders and support specialists. This study adds to a small but growing literature that examines the economic determinants of board structure (Boone et al., 2007; Coles et al., 2005; Gillan et al., 2003; Linck et al., 2005), by providing a unique lens in examining board characteristics that goes beyond the traditional insider/independent classification.

In this article we examine what affects the board of directors' involvement in the advice to management, with emphasis on the influence of crises on the board advisory tasks performance. Based on a survey of 881 small Norwegian firms, we analyse responses from CEOs in order to determine whether and to what extent the board is actively involved in the governance process during crises through providing advice. The study has two major contributions to board research in general and research of into small firms in particular. The first is the go beyond the "usual suspects" of board size, CEO duality, and board independence when looking for determinants of board involvement in advice. The second contribution is a clearer understanding of board involvement during crises. Our results show that board member diversity becomes particularly important during crises, since this provides the CEO and firm access to a more diverse pool of competences and experiences. We also find that crises moderate the effects of incentive on the board's involvement in advice. This evidence sheds new light on the determinants of directors' involvement in board tasks, suggesting that directors' incentive to perform certain board tasks vary according to the contingent situation the firm is experiencing.

Purpose - This paper proposes mainly that boards of directors (BOD) are teams that share characteristics with many other kinds of teams. As a consequence, some of the factors that lead to board effectiveness are the same factors that lead to team effectiveness in general. By integrating the organizational behaviour literature on teams with the governance literature, a comprehensive model of BOD performance is proposed. Design/methodology/approach - This conceptual paper proposes a model to assess the performance of a board and situates board performance as one input into firm performance. Findings - This paper outlines the dynamic interplay between board characteristics, functionality and performance and proposes a comprehensive model, based largely on the group dynamics literature. Research limitations/implications - Suggests that future research attempt to empirically address some (or all) of the items in the conceptual model. Acknowledges that operationalizing certain variables will prove challenging, but suggests that ethnographic accounts of how these variables (and potentially others) interact may be a valuable first step in more fully understanding board composition, functioning and performance. Practical implications - It is argued that by extending traditional passive agency roles, BOD may be able to provide a wider range of contributions to enhance shareholder value. Originality/value - This interdisciplinary paper integrates the group dynamics literature with the governance literature to propose a comprehensive model of BOD performance.

This study examines participation of African-Americans on the boards and board committees of the US Fortune 500. Prior work suggests the use of committee assignment to discern active versus figurehead involvement on boards. We use a logistic regression model that controls for director traits, firm characteristics and director resource-dependence roles to compare the odds that a black director will be assigned to key committees to those for a white director. We find that black directors are more (less) likely than whites to sit on audit and public affairs (executive) committees. Black female directors are more likely than both white females and black males to serve on finance committees. Thus there is some evidence that race plays a role in determining assignment to corporate board committees. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Numerous studies have examined the effects of diversity on team performance under a variety of circumstances, but little attention has been directed to the national composition or the international qualifications of top management teams. The results of three exploratory studies of the extent of internationalisation among boards of directors and executives from samples of the largest multinational corporations (MNCs) based in the United States, Europe, and Asia are presented. The findings clearly show that European MNCs have a greater proportion of internationally qualified personnel on both their boards of directors and within the executive ranks than do USA-based companies. In both the USA and European samples, executives were more likely to have international qualifications than directors, while data from the Asian sample suggest that directors might be more likely to have international qualifications.

Increased engagement by investors with the companies in which they invest has been a major change in Western economies since the 1980s. Shareholder value provides rationale and incentive for investor engagement. The book summarizes the basic principles of shareholder value, and explains the reasons for its growth, especially in the UK and the USA. The authors outline a spectrum of investor engagement ranging from indirect/laissez-faire influence via (threat of) exit to direct intervention in specific areas of management practice. The book focuses on two types of investor, institutional investors and private equity/venture capital investors. Different types of institutional investors have different incentives for engagement, and adopt different methods. 'Universal investors' with long time horizons, such as pension funds, have especially strong incentives for engagement, as illustrated by USS Limited. The book distinguishes between institutional investors' routine and extraordinary engagement, and shows how collaboration amongst investors through organizations such as the Institutional Shareholders' Committee offsets the high costs of monitoring and provides means for ensuring compliance with best City practice'. The engagement of private equity funds is illustrated through case studies of equity funds and the portfolio firms in which they invested. But corporate managers are not simply passive reactors to investors' interventions: managers seek to influence investors, for example through managing market expectations. Shareholder value conceptions are not universal: they are strong in the UK and the USA, but are weaker in coordinated market economies such as Germany. The book concludes by evaluating the normative case for shareholder value and investor engagement, arguing that conventional analyses overestimate the efficiency arguments for shareholder value and the equity arguments against shareholder value. The future development of corporate governance is seen to require greater openness and the inclusion of a wider range of interests, not the further enhancement of the protection accorded to shareholder interests.

A growing body of ethics research investigates gender diversity and governance on corporate boards, at individual and firm levels, in single country studies. In this study, we explore the environmental context of female representation on corporate boards of directors, using data from 43 countries. We suggest that women's representation on corporate boards may be shaped by the larger environment, including the social, political and economic structures of individual countries. We use logit regression to conduct our analysis. Our results indicate that countries with higher representation of women on boards are more likely to have women in senior management and more equal ratios of male to female pay. However, we find that countries with a longer tradition of women's political representation are less likely to have high levels of female board representation.

This article contributes to the literature on board effectiveness by being perhaps the first to systematically examine how the nature of outside directors' prior experience, and resulting expertise, will influence the performance of a focal firm's strategic initiatives. Our theoretical model is grounded in the psychological literature on expertise and its role in group decision making effectiveness. We focus on outside director expertise in acquisition decision making, and its implications for the performance of the acquisitions of a focal firm. Our conceptual framework indicates that directors will develop expertise in making particular kinds of acquisition decisions (e.g., related or unrelated acquisitions or acquisitions in specific industries or product markets) through their past experiences at other firms with decisions about those specific types of acquisitions, and we predict that this experience and expertise will have positive effects on the performance of a focal firm's acquisitions. We extend our theoretical model to consider the conditions under which relevant director experience will prove most beneficial. Our model predicts that outside director acquisition expertise will deliver the greatest benefits when the focal firm's board is independent from management. We find empirical support for all of our hypotheses. In considering how and when director experience and resulting expertise may influence the performance of corporate acquisitions, our theory and results help to highlight a potential second main focus for research on the long-standing question of what factors render boards of directors effective.

This study makes a contribution to the growing literature on the board's resource provision role by examining a specific type of resource provision (i.e., industry experience supplementing) and demonstrating the criticality of the liabilities of newness to this particular role. In this study, we find that among younger entrepreneurial firms, a dearth of top management industry experience is offset by the presence of outside directors with significant managerial industry experience, providing evidence of experience supplementing by outside directors. Our study highlights that the notion of experience supplementing at the upper echelons prevails in young firms as they try to alleviate the burdens of the liability of newness. Experience supplementing underscores board-management collaboration during early years of firm development. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Using a sample of 714 private family influenced businesses in Germany, we investigate the relationship of goal alignment between owners and managers and the existence of a board of directors. Agency theory and stewardship theory serve as theoretical bases for our study. We find that firms with relatively high levels of goal alignment are less likely to have a board of directors. Our results provide support for the substitution hypothesis of formal by social control mechanisms. Furthermore, the findings show that firms without a board and with relatively low levels of goal alignment have less family members in the top management team. This circumstance might in turn be a trigger for owners to install a board. (c) 2008 International Council for Small Business.

Purpose - This paper seeks to examine the current debate regarding the role of a board director. Design/methodology/approach - A comprehensive review of the corporate governance (CG) literature is undertaken, with a particular focus on director contribution to board effectiveness. Findings - The literature review revealed a number of issues in the CG literature that highlight the need to clarify board director role and pay closer attention to the processes needed for directors to perform their role effectively. These issues have broadly been classified into: conceptual issues regarding board effectiveness and director contribution; a methodological issue of level of analysis (board as a group and a director as individual); failure of much of the literature to account for the external context in which the board directors operate; and prescriptive nature of the literature. Originality/value - Issues pertinent to the CG literature identified in this paper hold theoretical and practical implications.

Corporate governance regulations across the globe increasingly push for a model in which top management is supervised by an independent, vigilant and skilled board of directors. Academic research, however, produces ambiguous results as to the direct effects of such board characteristics on firm performance. We therefore analyze the relationships between board attributes, board working processes and board role performance through intermediate relationships. Several hypotheses are derived and tested by analyzing data obtained from a survey at the board level in The Netherlands. Our results partly confirm the relevance of the model of board processes related to board role performance, as suggested by [Forbes, D.P., and Milliken, F.J. (1999) Cognition and corporate governance: Understanding boards of directors as strategic decision-making groups. Academy of Management Review, 24, 489-505]. Particularly, this study exemplifies the relevance of different board processes for explaining board role performance. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is considered by many to have made the most sweeping changes affecting corporate governance since the Securities and Exchange Acts of 1933 and 1934. About 4 years after its passing, however, many governance experts question whether the time and expense of compliance engender any real reforms. This article examines whether corporations have restructured their boards in response to the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley and finds evidence that companies are implementing changes that should strengthen the monitoring ability of their boards.

We examine the impact of boards of directors on shareholder returns arising from acquisition announcements in the context of varying CEO ownership levels. Agency theory emphasizes the benefits of incentives pertaining to top managers and directors, whereas resource dependence theory focuses on directors' resource provision, advice and counsel. Drawing on both these perspectives, the authors describe effective boards as those that are vigilant (via incentives to monitor) and rich in human capital (via relevant experience). Such boards are able not only to monitor in the decision control sense, but also to provide strategic benefits to a greater degree than typical outside directors. The authors contend and find that moderate levels of CEO ownership, combined with appropriate incentives and human capital, increase returns to shareholders of acquiring firms. Although shareholders benefit less when CEO ownership is negligible or substantial, their welfare is still enhanced to the degree that the board has appropriate incentives and human capital.

Director compensation can potentially represent an ethical minefield. When faced with supporting strategic decisions that can lead to an increase in director pay, directors may consider their own interests and not solely those of the shareholders to whom they are legally bound to represent. In such cases, directors essentially become agents, rather than those installed to protect principals (shareholders) from agents. Using acquisitions as a study context, we employ a matched-pair design and find a statistically significant difference in outside director compensation between acquiring and control firms. Outside directors of acquiring firms earn more than twice as much as their counterparts in the matched-sample. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

This study examined the human and social capital factors associated with higher post-succession firm performance in family enterprises in Singapore. We also investigated the moderating influence of the board of directors in terms of its service role as stewards of the enterprise. We found that a successor's industry experience and diversity of network ties were positively associated with firm performance and boards that focused their role as advisors to the successor enhanced post-succession firm performance.

Purpose - Although board expertise has been identified as an important determinant of board performance, some surveys are still reporting that the overall level of board expertise is insufficient to carry out current and emerging roles. Consequently, companies must ensure that board members have the required skills and knowledge. This study aims to examine three board processes aimed at developing and improving board expertise. Design/methodology/approach - Based on disclosures in the corporate governance guidelines of 100 leading US companies, the study focuses on three board processes, i.e. director nominations, orientation and education programs, and board performance evaluations. Findings - Based on the initial findings, it is found that most companies in the sample were in compliance with stock exchange requirements and provided information on director nominations, orientation and education programs and board performance evaluations. All too often, however, the companies disclosed generic, non-specific information; this provides little reassurance that the proper processes are in place to promote companies' long-term interests. Research limitations/implications - By examining these key board processes, the paper contributes to the governance literature by providing empirical evidence on this important topic and offering guidance to companies examining board processes aimed at improving directors' overall expertise. Originality/value - By focusing on disclosures in corporate governance guidelines, the authors also gain insight into decisions made by companies under increased pressure from securities regulators and other stakeholders to provide increased transparency on governance issues.

This paper aims to critique moral stakeholder theory (MST) and to contrast it to earlier strategic stakeholder approach (SSA). Interview data were gathered from top executives at 12 companies in the energy sector in Canada and an in-depth literature review was conducted on MST and SSA. "Value" for shareholder and stakeholder may not be mutually exclusive in some instances. MST may hold the key to giving the board a more useful, comprehensive framework of the firm's utility and purpose to society. Organizations may be selected on their ethical performance by investors. Depending on whether ethical criteria are included in the definition of "firm's value", decisions about which stakeholder theory to use become an issue of strategic importance to all organizations. The paper illustrates how the board of directors as the governing body of the organisation may find that continuous assessment of the company's stakeholders is valuable in reducing risks.

In this paper we investigate three corporate governance issues in 30 Italian family firms: (i) the orientation either to the Agency Theory or to the Stewardship Theory; (ii) the board of directors' composition; (iii) the ability to involve nonfamily individuals in the company's management and governance (Openness Index) and the decision-making quality (Extension Index) and we analyze empirical results through a cluster analysis by following the Gubitta and Gianecchini's approach (2002). Our conclusion suggests that (i) small Italian family firms' corporate governance systems seem to be consistent with the guidelines suggested by the Stewardship Theory and (ii) Italian family firms' boards are characterized by a relevant presence of family members.

Managers have a unique fiduciary responsibility to shareholders of a firm that implies a set of ethical obligations. At a minimum, managers are required to protect shareholder's interests when other stakeholders are unaffected by their decision. This ethical imperative has been established in the literature. In cases of conflicts of interest between managers and shareholders, the board of directors of the firm has an ethical obligation to shareholders. The structure of the board can affect its ability to fulfill this obligation. Two specific cases where managerial actions have been argued to be unethical are the adoption of classified boards and poison pills. In this study, we empirically analyze the role of board structure in protecting shareholder rights in the specific case of antitakeover provisions. We test this question on a sample of firms whose shareholders have voted to remove antitakeover provisions and find that independent, focused boards are more likely to accede to shareholder resolutions than are less independent boards. Board size is also important and related to other board structures. We draw implications of this finding for future research on the ethics of board governance. (c) 2008. Business Ethics Quarterly.

The 'value creating board' surveys have been conducted in several European countries, and initiatives have also been under taken to conduct similar studies on other continents. The objectives of this article are to present methodological issues in relation to survey research about boards of directors and to document some of the methodological reflections from the 'value creating board' surveys. Some studies using 'value creating board' survey data are also presented. A main concern in survey research about boards of directors is the common method bias. Questionnaire surveys are the common method in the 'value creating board' surveys, but the development of the instrument and the interpretation of the findings are based on results and experiences from board research using other methods. Furthermore, another methodological strength of the surveys is that they have been conducted in different countries, with different samples, at different points of time, with various respondents and by different researchers. The various studies are not only individual articles, but also pieces in a big puzzle. Details about samples and responses in the Norwegian 'value creating board' surveys are presented here as an input to this discussion. The article thus serves as a point of reference for contributions drawing from these and similar surveys. Ten studies are presented to illustrate the concepts, methods, samples and contribution from the 'value creating board' surveys.

The attention to boards of directors in small firms is increasing. Traditionally they have been considered to be passive but boards in small firms are undergoing major changes. We test hypotheses of what makes boards in small firms active and allows them to contribute to value creation. Activity is seen in relation to board task involvement. Predictions based on agency theory, resource dependence theory and the resource-based view of the firm are used. We found strong support for hypotheses highlighting the use of the knowledge of the board members and various board maintenance tools, such as regular board evaluations, to increase board task involvement. Actionable advice to boards in small firms is provided.

In this article, we present an overview of empirical research on boards and governance in leading U.S. and international academic journals in general management. Samples, methods, theories, and main concepts are presented and compared. The contributions are positioned with respect to contingency perspectives, behavioral perspectives, and evolutionary perspectives. Through an analysis of 127 empirical articles, we find that most studies on boards and governance have been influenced by a research tradition that treats the board of directors as an isolated 'black box.' Only few studies explore boards in context or explore behavioral perspectives of boards. Almost no studies include evolutionary perspectives. Based on our analysis, we explore alternative research streams and outline various directions for future research.

The ways in which boards of directors can create value for SMEs has received a considerable amount of attention in the governance literature. Inconclusive results from input-output studies have asked for another approach, focusing on the influence of contingencies, board processes and actual board task performance. In this article, we examine the effect of the board's actual task performance on the value that boards create in Dutch SMEs. Because of the two-tier governance system, we distinguish between the value creation of the supervisory board and the executive board. A factor analysis on a wide range of board tasks results in six distinguishable sets of board tasks: 1) operational control, 2) behavioural control, 3) output control, 4) strategy, 5) advice and counsel, and 6) networking. Results show that - from a CEO's perspective - the supervisory boards mainly create value through their performance on the advice and counsel tasks. Executive boards are found to create value through their performance on the advice, counsel and strategy tasks.

Boards of directors can be powerful decision-making bodies, with the discretion to deploy resources and promote value creating projects and activities in the organization. However, present corporate governance practices and mainstream academic research on boards and governance has to a large extent failed to address the importance of peak performing organizations and how boards may contribute to value creation. Rather, the dominant concern has been how boards best can protect value by shielding the invested stakes of external shareholders. Moreover, this stream of research has been heavily influenced by theories and models from financial economics, where boards are expected to solve conflicts of interests between faceless owners and opportunistic managers. Influenced by this perspective, the current debate on boards of directors thus tends to be very much about the protection and distribution of shareholder value and not about peak performing organizations (Gabrielsson and Huse, 2004).

This paper provides some strong support for existing literature in an under-researched context (the emerging economies of the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe). We develop and apply a model linking Board formation and environmental uncertainty, finding some partial support for our anticipated relationships in the area of Board establishment and perceived financial sector uncertainly, although no support for our anticipated relationship between governmental sector uncertainty and Board formation. research is supportive of the broad assertion that strategy in emerging economies is different and a 'one size fits all' (generally American) approach to the questions we ask regarding strategy in emerging regions will rarely provide accurate insights for management academics and practitioners with an interest in understanding and improving management decisions in the context of emerging economies.

Thirty years have passed since Pfeffer and Salancik's seminal work on resource dependence theory (RDT). During this time RDT has been applied broadly across the research domain to explain how organizations reduce environmental interdependence and uncertainty. In this review, the authors assess the conceptual development, empirical research, and application of RDT. They structure their review around the five options that Pfeffer and Salancik propose firms can enact to minimize environmental dependences: (a) mergers/vertical integration, (b) joint ventures and other interorganizational relationships, (c) boards of directors, (d) political action, and (e) executive succession.The authors summarize past work, synthesize contemporary thought, and propose future research directions.

This book integrates and assesses the vast and rapidly growing literature on strategic leadership, which is the study of top executives and their effects on organizations. The basic premise is that, in order to understand why organizations do the things they do, or perform the way they do, we need to comprehend deeply the people at the top-their experiences, abilities, values, social connections, aspirations, and other human features. The actions-or inactions-of a relatively small number of key people at the apex of an organization can dramatically affect organizational outcomes. The scope of strategic leadership includes individual executives, especially chief executive officers (CEOs), groups of executives (top management teams, or TMTs), and governing bodies (particularly boards of directors). Accordingly, the book addresses an array of topics regarding CEOs (e.g., values, personality, motives, demography, succession, and compensation); TMTs (including composition, processes, and dynamics); and boards of directors (why boards look and behave the way they do, and the consequences of board profiles and behaviors). The book synthesizes what is known about strategic leadership and indicates new research directions. (c) 2009 by Oxford University Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

In this article, the authors develop and test a theoretical model of the effects of outside directors' human and social capital on firm growth. They posit that outside directors' board memberships and managerial experiences have additive and interactive effects. Using a longitudinal sample of high technology firms, they test their theory and find that outside directors' membership on multiple boards, industry-specific managerial experience, and firm-specific founding experience have strong additive effects on firm growth. They also find negative interaction effects, indicating the costs of acquiring and combining certain types of outside director human and social capital within the board.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: Over the last four decades, research on the relationship between boards of directors and strategy has proliferated. Yet to date there is little theoretical and empirical agreement regarding the question of how boards of directors contribute to strategy. This review assesses the extant literature by highlighting emerging trends and identifying several avenues for future research. Research Findings/Results: Using a content-analysis of 150 articles published in 23 management journals up to 2007, we describe and analyze how research on boards of directors and strategy has evolved over time. We illustrate how topics, theories, settings, and sources of data interact and influence insights about board-strategy relationships during three specific periods. Theoretical Implications: Our study illustrates that research on boards of directors and strategy evolved from normative and structural approaches to behavioral and cognitive approaches. Our results encourage future studies to examine the impact of institutional and context-specific factors on the (expected) contribution of boards to strategy, and to apply alternative methods to fully capture the impact of board processes and dynamics on strategy making. Practical Implications: The increasing interest in boards of directors' contribution to strategy echoes a movement towards more strategic involvement of boards of directors. However, best governance practices and the emphasis on board independence and control may hinder the board contribution to the strategic decision making. Our study invites investors and policy-makers to consider the requirements for an effective strategic task when they nominate board members and develop new regulations.

ABSTRACT Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: A coherent alternative to an economic approach of corporate governance is missing. In this paper we take steps towards developing a behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance. Research Findings/Results: Building upon concepts such as political bargaining, routinization of decision making, satisficing, and problemistic search, a behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance will focus more on (1) interactions and processes inside and outside the boardroom; (2) the fact that decision making is made by coalitions of actors and objectives are results of political bargaining; and (3) the notion that not only conflicting, but also cooperating, interests are parts of the boards' decision making and control over firm resources. Theoretical Implications: The consequences are a new research agenda for boards and corporate governance. The agenda will focus on actual instead of stylized descriptions of board behavior. In a behavioral perspective the emphasis on problems of coordination, exploration, and knowledge creation may dominate over problems of conflict of interest, exploitation, and the distribution of value. A future research agenda based on a behavioral framework calls for novel and adventurous research designs. Practical Implications: A behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance will be closer to actual board behavior than the traditional economic approach and research about boards and corporate governance may thus become more actionable for practitioners.

Despite the increasing attention of management scholars to boards of directors, there is still scant evidence on the antecedents of board task performance. The lack of significant results seems to be due to some theoretical and methodological choices followed by scholars, i.e. the almost exclusive reliance on agency theory and the use of demographic data. Following the call for dismantling the fortresses dominating past studies, this paper contributes to opening the 'black box' of boards of directors, developing a conceptual model that considers the impact of board members' diversity, commitment and critical debate on board task effectiveness in performing its service and control tasks. We collected primary data through a questionnaire survey, and we tested the model controlling for board, firm and industry characteristics. Our findings suggest that (i) the predictors we identified, and particularly the board members' commitment, are far more important than board demographics to predict board task performance; (ii) firm and industry contexts exert a significant influence on board task performance; (iii) predictors have a different impact on specific sets of tasks. Thus, our findings support the idea that several board characteristics and contingencies at both industry and firm level must be acknowledged in board design. (c) 2008 British Academy of Management.

We present results from a study about women and employee-elected board members, and fill some of the gaps in the literature about their contribution to board effectiveness. The empirical data are from a unique data set of Norwegian firms. Board effectiveness is evaluated in relation to board control tasks, including board corporate social responsibility (CSR) involvement. We found that the contributions of women and employee- elected board members varied depending on the board tasks studied. In the article we also explored the effects of the esteem of the women and employee-elected board members, and we used creative discussions in the boardroom as a mediating variable. Previous board research, including research about women and employeeelected directors, questions if the board members contribute to board effectiveness. The main message from this study is that it may be more important to ask how, rather than if, women and employee-elected board members contribute, and we need to open the black box of actual board behavior to explore how they may contribute.

Certain environmental and social behaviours have caused an increase in the social pressure felt by corporations when doing business. To palliate this pressure, companies have generated a means of legitimising their behaviour: the reporting of corporate social responsibility. The objective of this article is to test for the existence of relations between certain characteristics of the board of directors and the reporting of corporate social information. The results obtained show an important effect of the independence and diversity of the board in reporting practices, the independent members being the main promoters of such initiatives. On the contrary, board activity and the reputation of its Chairman have no effect, whereas the diversity of the organization signifi es a move backward in different stages of the process.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study analyses the form of the board-TMT interaction and the firm's level of strategic change. Relatedly, we explore the premise that there needs to be a good fit between the board of directors and the top management team to effectively bring about strategic change. Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data from a sample of 119 firms in the period 1993-2000, we found that when a synergy exists between the board and the TMT, there will be a greater inclination for strategic change. The results indicate that a board's inclination to contribute to strategic change increases as the board size increases. Equally, it is possible to accept that the relationship between board tenure and their inclination towards strategic change is not linear. Finally, the simultaneous analysis of board composition and the ratio of directors on the TMT, demonstrates that the interaction of both variables has effects on the firm's strategic change. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides empirical support in favor of an active role of the board shaping the firm's strategic decisions. We have developed and tested a set of arguments regarding with the role of the board on the firm's change in strategy. We have investigated as well, the leveraging effect of one of the variables that define the composition of the management team on the relationship board-change in strategy. Practitioner/Policy Implications: In order to create an effective board, a broader governance structure must be examined with a detailed study of aspects of the composition of the board and the TMT (previous research has only considered characteristics linked to the CEO). The dynamics of the relationships between both governance mechanisms are essential and leverage the board capability. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This study investigates how the implementation of special attributes of CEO compensation contracts is determined by both the acquisition and the acquirer features for a set of M&A deals undertaken by Canadian acquiring firms. Our findings reveal that when agency problems are higher, manifested by larger control premiums and poor firm performance, boards of directors tend to implement stronger mechanisms of incentive alignment around M&A transactions. Relying on multiple interdisciplinary logics that are activated to explain directors' ability to effectively perform their monitoring function, we show that boards are reactive rather than proactive in dealing with agency problems. Data are further interpreted in light of the unique aspects of the Canadian institutional context. Based on asymmetric risk properties of two different groups of executive compensation modes examined in this study, testing the substitution effects between alternative governance mechanisms is proposed as an interesting avenue for future research.

We propose a research agenda that can assist in developing a dynamic and comprehensive theory of boards of directors. It is based upon the concept of temporality, with time being organised around the life-cycle metaphor, and integrates research on agency theory, decision-making theory and resource dependence theory. We identify three key roles of boards of directors: 1) Monitoring and controlling top management 2) Involvement in strategic decision-making; and 3) Providing access to resources and networks. Our analysis suggests that boards perform all three roles, but that these roles change over time. We propose clear researchable questions for each stage of the organisational life cycle as well as the transition between the stages.

This conceptual paper analyses why some companies in Russia give strong weight to the external roles and some to the internal roles of the boards of directors. The institutional background of Russian corporate governance is reviewed, concentrating on the contextual variables of time of founding, ownership type and governmental dependency, which are seen to explain the varying weight given to internal and external board roles. After arriving at several propositions, the paper finishes with suggestions for an empirical evaluation of the proposed relationships and addresses several managerial implications that stem from the discussion. This paper addresses the under-researched field of contingencies in board roles, focusing on Russia and emphasizing the importance of the prevailing institutional framework in transition economies.

The central question posed in this paper will be how to organize board composition in order to ensure a responsible corporate governance both from a CSR and a good governance perspective. Adopting a stakeholder approach to corporate governance, we analyze the arguments given by different theoretical approaches for linking specific board composition with financial performance and CSR, and discuss the empirical research conducted. Despite the inconclusive findings of empirical research, it can be argued that diverse stakeholders on the board will promote CSR activities within the firm, but at the same time will increase board capital (which ultimately may lead to a better financial performance). Finally, we propose a model for selecting board members based both on ethical and pragmatic arguments.

Drawing on the Upper Echelons perspective we examine how the composition of the board of directors affects firms' degree of internationalization. Specifically, we sample 108 large-sized European and US corporations to test whether the international experience and former government ties of the board, the average age and tenure of the directors and the diversity of their functional background are related to internationalization. We find that the international experience and the average tenure of the board are positively related and the average age of the directors is negatively related to internationalization. We find no relationship between the functional background and former government experience of the board and internationalization.

An effective system of corporate governance has both internal and external aspects that have to be sufficiently responsive if governance is to succeed. In this book, Ahmed Naciri examines these two core aspects or the latest buzzword in business and management theory. Internal aspects include ownership structure, the board of directors and committees, internal control, risk management, transparency and financial reporting. External aspects can either be market-oriented, or can take the form of credit ranking, and/or social requirements. Due to the original orientation of the Sarbanes/Oxley Law, concentrating solely on financial disclosure and given its decisive and tremendous influence on all other similar corporate governance legislations all over the world, most writings on corporate governance have dealt with solely internal corporate governance mechanisms. This book aim is to fill up the gap by using a systemic approach and giving a global picture of the corporate governance theoretical foundations, mainly by putting the emphasis on its double dimension: internal and external.

Purpose - This paper aims to examine the prevalence of directors of US Fortune 500 firms who come from an academic background, and possible unique reasons for their appointment. Design/methodology/approach - Based on extant theory of the resource-dependence roles of non-management directors, this study proposes and tests three hypotheses concerning distinctive reasons firms may appoint an academic to their boards. Academic directors may serve unique roles in increasing board demographic diversity, increasing firm intellectual capital, and providing links to local geographic constituents. Using year 2002 data from the US Fortune 500 firms, this study presents descriptive statistics and uses t-tests and x 2 tests to examine hypotheses. Findings - Firms having academics on their boards have greater board demographic diversity than firms without an academic director. Firms with academic directors have the same average emphasis on knowledge-based earnings as other firms. Academics associated with US top-ranked universities tend to be more likely to hold board seats. Firms tend to select academic directors from the geographic regions where the firm is headquartered and have a slight tendency to use them on public affairs committees. Research limitations/implications - This study's findings highlight a unique non-monitoring advantage of academic directors for firms seeking increased board diversity, and potential community/stakeholder liaisons. Practical implications - Firms wishing to increase board diversity or improve relationships with other stakeholder groups may find academic directors useful to such efforts. Academic directors appear to be just as capable as other outside directors in developing firm intellectual capital. Originality/value - This paper extends the present literature in resource dependence by examining academic directors, a new director subset. The paper is also unique in that it uses data collected from proxy statements, rather than survey data. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

122 initial public offerings (IPOs) occurring on the Stockholm Stock Exchange from January 1996 until September 2006 have been examined to assess the impact of institutional isomorphism on the selection of directors for boards facing the transition to listed companies. A high level of union representation as well as the restructuring of boards prior to an IPO and in anticipation of legal changes gives strong support for the influence of coercive isomorphism on IPO firms. Companies within industry sectors make similar choices with regard to their directors, their choices being dissimilar from their associates in other industry groupings. This supports the concepts underlying mimetic isomorphism. Finally normative isomorphism is largely supported by the reliance of corporations on a closed group of directors with similar educational backgrounds. All in all, societal and regulatory pressures, as modelled under institutional theory, are influencing the processes of corporate governance during an IPO.

This study analyses the impact of the level and the type of the intangible assets on six major financial and governance policies: financial structure, dividend pay-outs, managerial share ownership, external ownership concentration, board of directors' structure and auditing. These policies directly depend on the interactions between managers, shareholders and debt holders. Using a UK cross-sectional sample (374 firms for the year 2000), the results suggest that the bundles of financial and governance policies differ between levels of overall intangible asset intensity, levels of all intangible assets other than research and development (RD), categories of intangible assets (RD versus non-RD) and levels of stock of RD. Hence, the level and type of intangible assets seem to have significant impact on financial and governance policies. Different levels and/or types of intangible assets seem to require different portfolios of financial and governance policies.

Based on the results of a survey of 161 Canadian companies, this study focuses on board characteristics and their relationship to two essential board roles: strategy involvement and management monitoring. To examine these issues, a typology highlighting four possible board types is presented based on the level of independence and expertise of boards (authoritative, executive, institutional and convenient). The study demonstrates that board characteristics do have a significant impact on board roles. This study's findings are consistent with basic agency arguments regarding the importance of creating independent boards. However, it highlights the importance of board expertise as an essential criterion for board performance. Copyright (c) 2009, Inderscience Publishers.

The performance of healthcare non-profit public organisations is an important factor that can affect the quality of healthcare provision. This study attempts to investigate how board attributes affect board and organisational performance. Furthermore, it explores how dimensions of board effectiveness are related to organisational performance. In order to achieve these goals, survey questionnaires were sent to 120 CEOs of Greek public hospitals and 34 usable responses were received. The findings show some clear relationships between board attributes, board performance and some aspects of organisational performance. Copyright (c) 2009, Inderscience Publishers.

This article explores how the diversity of board resources and the number of women on boards affect firms' corporate social responsibility (CSR) ratings, and how, in turn, CSR influences corporate reputation. In addition, this article examines whether CSR ratings mediate the relationships among board resource diversity, gender composition, and corporate reputation. The OLS regression results using lagged data for independent and control variables were statistically significant for the gender composition hypotheses, but not for the resource diversity-based hypotheses. CSR ratings had a positive impact on reputation and mediated the relationship between the number of women on the board and corporate reputation. (c) 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: The increased attention to women on corporate boards presents new challenges to governance research. In this paper we go beyond demography and open the " black box" of board behavior by drawing upon theories of gender differences and group effectiveness. Research Findings/Insights: A unique survey of 201 Norwegian firms is used. The findings suggest that the ratio of women directors is positively associated with board strategic control. In addition, we find that the positive effects of women directors on board effectiveness are mediated through increased board development activities and through decreased level of conflict. However, our results show no evidence for a positive association between women directors and open debate. Nonetheless, open debate enhances board's strategic and operational control. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Recognizing the limitations of traditional governance theories to explain the role and contributions of women on corporate boards, this paper draws upon group effectiveness and gender differences theories to shed some light on whether and how women make a difference to board effectiveness in strategic and operational control. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Women's ability to make a contribution to the board may be attributable to their different leadership styles. The presence of women on corporate boards seems to increase board effectiveness through reducing the level of conflict and ensuring high quality of board development activities.

We develop the construct of board capital, composed of the breadth and depth of directors' human and social capital, and explore how board capital affects strategic change. Building upon resource dependence theory, we submit that board capital breadth leads to more strategic change, while board capital depth leads to less. We also recognize CEO power as a moderator of these relationships. Our hypotheses are tested using a random sample of firms on the S&P 500. We find support for the effect of board capital on strategic change, and partial support for the moderating effect of CEO power. (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Boards of directors' attention to monitoring represents an understudied topic in corporate governance. By analyzing hundreds of board meeting transcripts, we find that board members do not maintain constant levels of attention toward monitoring, but instead selectively allocate attention to their monitoring function. Drawing from the attention-based view, prospect theory, and the literature on power, we find that deviation from prior performance and CEO duality affect this allocation. Specifically, while negative deviation from prior performance increases boards' attention to monitoring, positive deviation from prior performance reduces it. The presence of duality also reduces the boards' allocation of attention to monitoring. Additional analysis demonstrates that the effects of duality are realized in part by the CEO-chair's control of the meeting's agenda and location. Finally, the results show that duality and deviation from prior performance interactively affect boards' attention to monitoring. In total, we find that board members do not consistently monitor management in order to protect shareholder value, a proposition often assumed within governance research; rather, our results demonstrate that board members' monitoring behaviors are contextually dependent. The contextual dependency of board attention to monitoring suggests that additional efforts may be needed to ensure the protection of shareholders' interests.

Using upper echelons theory and the concept of "faultlines," we argue that heterogeneity on a board of directors influences discussion of entrepreneurial issues in board meetings. We also propose that meeting context can influence such discussions. Results suggest that tenure variance, firm/industry background heterogeneity, and the proportion of directors with output-oriented backgrounds are positively associated with a board's discussion of entrepreneurial issues. Weak faultlines increase and strong faultlines decrease such discussion. Meeting informality moderates these relationships: functional background heterogeneity decreases discussion of entrepreneurial issues, but the proportion of directors with output-oriented backgrounds and strong faultlines increase it.

This study contributes to the corporate governance literature by demonstrating how greater board of director control of management at a given firm can have unanticipated adverse effects on the leadership of-other-companies. We specifically show that greater board control reduces affected CEOs' willingness to provide various forms of strategic help (e.g., advice on strategic issues) to other CEOs, making it more difficult for other-company CEOs to access assistance on strategic matters that would otherwise enhance their firms' performance. Our theory and results indicate that these effects are mediated by CEOs' reduced social identification with the "corporate elite." (c) Academy of Management Journal.

An in-depth analysis of 11 cases is used to provide insight into the neglected area of the dynamics of boards in academic spin-offs. Drawing on stage-based, resource dependence, and social network theories, we explore board formation and changes in board composition occurring in Norwegian and US spin-offs. We find that these theories are important complements to earlier research on boards in technology-based new ventures. The process of board formation is mainly driven by social networks of the founders. Although we find differences in the initial board compositions in Norwegian and US spin-offs, there is convergence over time in subsequent board changes, which are mainly driven by the social networks of the board chair. Additions of key board members are associated with the progress of a spin-off developing from one stage to another. Several avenues for future research and implications are discussed.

In modern organizations, information technologies (IT) often help drive organizational strategies. As such, IT require both judicious planning and oversight. While executive oversight over IT is quite common nowadays, several studies indicate that due to the many benefits and risks associated with IT, more/better board-level oversight may be in order. Unfortunately, there is a scarcity of research on the involvement of board members in IT governance. We attempt to partially fill this gap by empirically examining the degree to which the 27 IT governance questions that make up an IT board governance framework recommended by the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants are raised by the board members of 94 Canadian firms. We also investigate the extent to which the questions are considered important. Our findings show that: board members use only some of the IT governance questions and not all the recommended ones; there is a gap between the IT governance questions board members ask and the ones they perceive to be important; and the number and importance of IT governance questions that board members ask appear to vary with both their organization's strategic use of IT and the need for IT reliability. Implications for research and practice are offered.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: The specific monitoring effect of boards of directors versus industry regulation is unclear. In this paper, we examine how the interaction between bank-level monitoring and regulatory regimes influences the announcement period returns of acquiring banks in the US and twelve European economies. Research Findings/Insights: We study three board monitoring mechanisms - independence, CEO-chair duality, and diversity - and analyze their effectiveness in preventing underperforming merger strategies under bank regulators of varying strictness. Only under strict banking regulation regimes, do board independence and diversity improve acquisition performance. In less strict regulatory environments, corporate governance is virtually irrelevant in improving the performance outcomes of merger activities. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results indicate a complementary role between monitoring by boards and bank regulation. This study is the first to report evidence consistent with complementarity by investigating the effectiveness (rather than the prevalence) of governance arrangements across regulatory regimes. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our work offers insights to policymakers charged with improving the quality of decision-making at financial institutions. Attempts to improve the ability of bank boards to critically assess managerial initiatives are most likely to be successful if internal governance is accompanied by strict industry regulation.

Few aspects of corporate board diversity have generated the focused attention that the participation, position, and promise of women's service on the board has generated, especially in recent years. Of particular note is the extent to which women serve on large firm boards of directors (e.g., Fortune 500 firms). Increases in levels of participation have been described as glacial. While critics decry the level of participation of women on large-scale corporate boards, careful scrutiny suggests substantial progress. Concurrent with steady increases in the overall participation of women on corporate boards are increases in their presence on key board committees. Importantly, women's leadership of key board committees and their service as lead directors has improved in parallel with increases in their board memberships. These increases are particularly noteworthy in the post Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) period. Such trends suggest the continued progress of women in assuming prominent positions in the corporate governance landscape, and provide evidence that the increasingly challenging environment in the post-SOX era has not attenuated the gains noted in the pre-SOX period.

We highlight how directors and senior managers perceive the roles of a board to involve overseeing risk and compliance, strategy, governance, developing the CEO and senior management and managing stakeholders. We find that managers and directors perceive board effectiveness as linked to different combinations of these roles and that there appear to be differences in perceptions between different types of firms. We conclude that clarity around the board's role set is critical to furthering the corporate governance research agenda, and that the relationship between board roles and perceived board effectiveness differs between managers and directors.

Corporate governance and finance are dynamic academic fields that offer myriad opportunities for business ethics analysis. Within the corporate governance triad in recent years, shareholders have increased their power over boards of directors and executives through both regulation and movements to change corporate by-laws. The impact of board characteristics on firm performance has proven elusive, leading to questions concerning board processes and individual director beliefs and behaviors. At the same time, CEOs have lost considerable power, leaving many struggling to regain their control and maintain their compensation levels, while others adopt a stewardship approach to their posts. In the field of finance, the recent financial debacle has led to a reexamination of financial regulation and of the fundamental nature and purpose of the industry. All of these issues provide business ethicists fodder for investigation and analysis. (c)2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.

Manuscript Type: EmpiricalResearch Question/Issue: Do the presence and independence of nominating committees within boards of directors affect the extent of rewards and sanctions provided by the labor market to directors with a reputation for being active in monitoring management? Research Findings/Insights: Results drawn from a longitudinal sample of directors sitting on the board of 200 public French firms suggest that the stronger a director's reputation for being active in increasing control over management, the larger the number of his or her subsequent appointments to (1) boards with a nominating committee; (2) to boards with a nominating committee that excludes the CEO; and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by non-executive directors. In contrast, we found that a director's reputation of being active in increasing control over management does not impact the number of his or her subsequent appointments (1) to boards without a nominating committee; (2) to boards with a nominating committee that includes the CEO; and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by executive directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study shows that the outcome of the power struggle between the CEO and incumbent directors during the candidate selection process determines the profile of directors who will ultimately obtain the board appointment. On the one hand, independent nominating committees are likely to reduce the influence of CEOs over the process of a director's appointment, and therefore are likely to increase the recruitment of directors with reputations for being active in exercising control over managers. On the other hand, nonexistence of nominating committees or presence of weak nominating committees under the influence of the CEO decouple directors' reputations for being active in controlling management from the likelihood of obtaining new appointments. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers interested in increasing the efficiency of the labor market for directors. More specifically, it highlights the conditions under which directors with a reputation of being active in increasing control over management are likely to be rewarded by the labor market for directors. These conditions include (1) the creation of a nominating committee; (2) exclusion of the CEO from this committee; and (3) domination of this committee by outside directors.

This study examines the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) pay fairness and future stakeholder management (SM) as well as the effect of the board of directors on this relationship. The results show that CEO pay fairness has an effect on future SM such that when underpaid, CEOs decrease SM and when overpaid, CEOs increase SM. Additionally, the relationship between CEO pay fairness and SM becomes stronger as the ratio of inside directors on the board increases, which suggests that as both management control increases and board diversity decreases, the CEO's control over SM increases. Implications for SM and CEO pay are discussed. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Purpose: This paper aims to contribute to research studies on boards of directors in the Chinese transition economy that are by far, few and limited. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses basic data compilation method to investigate the board characteristics of large and medium Chinese companies listed on the Shenzhen and Shanghai Stock Exchange between 2004 and 2006. Sample data on these companies were obtained from the China Center for Economic Research (CCER) database that contains information on at least 1,350 listed companies in a particular year. Companies with missing data or incomplete information on board attributes are not included in the sample in this paper. Studies of relationships between board characteristics and firm performance in the Chinese context are compared to those studies in the West for determining whether there is a conclusive empirical outcome. Findings: This investigation found some significant differences in board characteristics between the Chinese and Western contexts, such as non-compliance with legal requirement, equity-based compensation structure for board members, and lag in the establishment of Chinese board committees as compared to their counterparts in developed Western countries. In addition, the literature review reveals that studies of relationships between board characteristics and firm performance from the small community of scholars investigating the Chinese context produce inconclusive results similar to those studies of the West. Practical implications: The empirical findings and literature review suggest that the prototype of an effective board may vary from one industry to another, or even from one company to another, and perhaps across time for the same company. Originality/value: This contingency approach to board impact on firm performance may be relevant to companies operating in the Chinese transition economy, where factors are evolving continuously at the micro, macro, and international levels.

The board of directors is an important entity in a company, creating a link between shareholders and managers and therefore playing an important role in the governance of a firm. This study focuses on board structure and the extent of the corporate governance statement disclosure. This study found that the size of the corporate board does have some influence on the extent of the corporate governance statement disclosure. It is quite surprising to find that the rest of the variables involving the board structure do not have any association with the extent of corporate governance statement.

The study of the effectiveness of boards of directors is a tremendously interesting area of investigation, heightened by the many financial scandals of the recent past. Research efforts have suffered from several deficiencies like the inconsistency of many of the results achieved (Daily, Dalton and Cannella, 2003; Dalton, Daily, Ellstrand and Johnson, 1998; Johnson et al., 1996). It emphasises the need to go further with this research subject. Within this framework, our paper examines board effectiveness through board members' level of knowledge and experience and board structure. We understand that both dimensions: board composition and structure are not enough to board effectiveness but determine the potential to get a strategic capability. Our results show how board size, length of tenure of directors and board members' experience in senior management positions, have effects on firm financial performance.

Decades of research on corporate boards of directors resulting in diverse and often inconsistent findings have not dampened scholarly interest in the topic. Instead, researchers are attempting to more effectively model the board-firm relationship. One such modeling approach considers the power of the board in relation to top management. Drawing on upper echelons thinking (Hambrick & Mason, 1984) and the concept of managerial power (Finkelstein, 1992), this conceptual study develops the notion of board power in relation to CEO duality. Based on a framework composed of structural, ownership, expertise, and prestige power of the board, the study develops several propositions predicting the impact of board characteristics on a key aspect of managerial power - the appointment of the CEO to the position of board chair. This work contributes to scholarly understanding of the role of agency theory in explaining corporate governance phenomena by extending upper echelons thinking to the study of boards.

Intangible assets show a set of characteristics-namely, high levels of risk and uncertainty, firm-specificity, human capital intensity, low observability and long-term nature-that make them markedly distinct from other categories of assets. These characteristics are likely to have substantial impact on the levels of agency costs of debt (asset-substitution and under-investment problems) and equity (hidden action and hidden information problems), information asymmetry, bankruptcy costs, transaction costs of debt and equity, and non-debt tax shields. Consequently, this study analyses the impact of the level and the type of the intangible assets on six major financial and governance policies: financial structure, dividend payouts, managerial share ownership, external ownership concentration, board of directors' structure and auditing. Using two UK cross-sectional samples (373 and 356 firms for the years 2000 and 2001, respectively), the results suggest that the level and type of intangible assets have a negative impact on leverage and no impact on dividend payout, managerial equity ownership, outside equity ownership, board structure and audit demand.

This study contributes to the work on board composition and firm corporate social responsibility by extending it to the environmental domain. It evaluates the relationship between boards of directors' composition and environmental corporate social responsibility (ECSR) by integrating literatures on board composition, firm corporate social responsibility, and individual differences in attitudes toward and information about environmental issues. Using disclosed company data and the natural environment ratings data from Kinder Lydenberg Domini (KLD) Inc. for 78 Fortune 1000 companies, the study finds that a higher proportion of outside board directors is associated with more favorable ECSR and higher KLD strengths scores. Firms with boards composed of three or more female directors received higher KLD strengths scores. And, boards whose directors average closer to 56 years in age and those with a higher proportion of Western European directors are more likely to implement environmental governance structures or processes. Our results also reinforce growing concerns around unidimensional KLD measures. (c) 2011 SAGE Publications.

This study investigates the relationship between strong firm environmental performance and board characteristics that capture boards' monitoring and resource provision abilities during an era when the natural environment and the related strategic opportunities have increased in importance. The authors relate the proxy for strong environmental performance to board characteristics that represent boards' monitoring role (i.e., independence, CEO-chair duality, concentration of directors appointed after the CEO, and director shareholding) and resource provision role (i.e., board size, directors on multiple boards, CEOs of other firms on the board, lawyers on the board, and director tenure). The authors provide evidence consistent with both theories of board roles. Specifically, consistent with their agency theory-driven predictions, the authors find evidence of higher environmental performance in firms with higher board independence and lower concentration of directors appointed after the CEO on the board of directors. Consistent with resource dependence theory, they show that environmental performance is higher in firms that have larger boards, larger representation of active CEOs on the board, and more legal experts on the board. Their findings are generally robust to a number of sensitivity analyses. These findings have implications for managers, firms, shareholders, and regulators who act on behalf of shareholders, if they are interested in influencing environmental performance.

This study sought to investigate if there is a link between women on boards of directors and corporate sustainability. Using a sample of publicly listed firms from Australia, the results suggest some level of support that a link does exist. Boards that have a strong complement of gender diversity are expected to offer more effective monitoring of agents, as well as offer more stringent enforcement of ethical conduct, thereby minimizing affects of subversion of shareholder funds that can be detrimental to their returns. Accordingly, findings confirm a positive link between women on boards and economic growth. Because of their relational abilities, women on boards are more likely able to engage with multiple stakeholders and respond to their needs, resulting in an avenue for demonstrating social responsiveness, which is confirmed by the results. However, due to their backgrounds and work experiences, sex-based biases and stereotyping might exist in boardrooms with men directors discounting input from women directors on issues relating to environmental quality. The results of this study find that women directors are not significantly associated with environmental quality. Discussion is given to these findings along with paths for future research.

This paper offers a review of the theoretical and empirical literature addressing boards of directors within the unique organizational setting of family businesses. By reviewing and structuring past research, this paper aims to improve the understanding of how family involvement in firms affects the roles and behaviours of boards. The review of the literature is structured according to the family business board's two primary tasks as an internal administrative body, namely the exercise of control and the provision of advice. For both board tasks, theoretical perspectives and the match between theory and empirical findings will be discussed. The review concludes by offering an integrative discussion of the relevant theories and by highlighting the need for multi-theoretic, process and contextualized approaches in future research on boards of directors in family businesses.

The aim of the paper is to investigate the relationship between board reputation and corporate social performance. Specifically, we claim that corporate social performance may be a function of board attributes and we investigate the association between board reputation - in terms of board composition, competence, diversity, leadership, structure and links with the external environment - and the social performance of firms, after controlling for other companyspecific characteristics. In order to explore such a relationship, we analyse the association between corporate social performance and board reputation of the Business Ethics 100 Best Corporate Citizens over the period 2005-2007. Data on corporate social responsibility are collectedfrom the KLD's SOCRATES database, which is derived from multiple sources and is not dependent upon corporate self-reporting. Data on board reputation are hand-collected from corporate reports and proxy statements. Our empirical evidence shows that the proportions of independent, community influential and female directors are positively associated with corporate social performance, while the presence of a corporate social responsibility (CSR) committee is positively associated with community performance. In contrast, we find that CEO duality and community influential directors with multiple directorships have a negative effect on corporate social performance. (c) 2011 Taylor & Francis.

This study extends work on independent directors to examine the influence of their human capital and social capital on investor reactions to the board's CEO selection decision. We predict that human capital, as represented by the board's CEO experience and industry experience, and social capital, as represented by directors' co-working experience on the board and external directorship ties to other corporate boards, will influence the stock market reactions to new CEO appointments. In a sample of 208 new CEO appointment events in U.S. manufacturing firms between 1999 and 2003, we found that the stock market reacted favorably to the appointments made by boards with higher levels of human and social capital. We also found that the effect of internal social capital was stronger when the new CEO was an insider rather than an outsider. The implications of the results for director selection and CEO succession are discussed. (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: How are national institutional systems related to the proportion of women found on corporate boards of directors of companies listed in particular countries? Which particular types of national institutions play the most important role? We explore cross-country variation in the pattern of female representation on corporate boards and evaluate the extent to which it is associated with the nature of national institutional systems as captured in five frameworks each of which emphasizes the importance of a distinct type of national institutions. Our analysis includes 38 countries and covers the years 2001-07. Research Findings/Insights: Our findings show that as much as half of the variation in the presence of women on corporate boards across countries is attributable to national institutional systems and that culturally and legally-oriented institutional systems appear to play the most significant role in shaping board diversity. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study suggests that country-level institutions, previously neglected in studies of board diversity, play an important role in shaping the prevalence of women on corporate boards and that these need to be more fully incorporated in future research on board diversity. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The importance of national institutional systems for board diversity suggests that policy levers of a regulatory nature and national cultural characteristics are important elements in driving corporate board diversity and offer distinct opportunities for tailoring a mix of corporate governance interventions that suit the particular institutional nature of a given country.

Manuscript Tytpe: Empirical Research Question/Issues: The resource-based view of the firm may provide the theoretical explanation as to how boards can be a source of firm competitive advantage. Directors' experience, knowledge, expertise are valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable resources that make up the board potential. These resources must be integrated with other firm resources in strategic processes through dynamics of relations. Research Findings/Insights: Given the preliminary nature of this work, the empirical section is an exclusive analysis of the board's potential. Our specific aim is to establish whether resources that directors bring to board are sources of board competence and ability with consequences for international strategic decisions. To do this, we use a sample of 562 board members of 45 listed Spanish companies. Our results show that average board tenure is negatively related to the firm's degree of international diversification. Directors with long tenures may operate from the basis of routines that are built up over time and their knowledge of the firm could eventually become a less valuable resource. The empirical findings also indicate that the directors' managerial experience within the specific industry to which the firm belongs and a high level of academic achievement affects the firm's degree of international diversification. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The contribution of this article is three-fold. First, it emphasizes the role of directors in board effectiveness, investigating why and how relevant elements of directors' human capital can enhance board ability to perform their roles making up the board potential. Secondly, it refines and extends the concept of "board capability" as an adequate configuration of potential and relationship dynamics that allow boards to undertake their task competently over time. Third, this article stresses the active participation of a board in firm internationalization. Practitioner/Policy Implications: One of the important practical implications of these results refers to the selection of board members. In order to increase board effectiveness, in the context of firm internationalization, the selection process must be guided by the search of intangibles, inimitable and unique resources, that the board can capitalize on in order to differentiate its potential over competitors.

We examine whether corporate governance matters more for firms facing financial distress. We theorize that financial crisis changes the relative costs and benefits of governance mechanisms and that more independent and smaller boards become more valuable in distressed firms. We further hypothesize that CEO power becomes increasingly beneficial as concentrated power allows the firm to respond more rapidly to the crisis. Event-history analysis of the failure of publicly traded Internet firms over the period 2000-2002 confirms our hypotheses. Our results suggest that the association between governance and survival depends on firm and environmental context and that one-size-fits-all prescriptions for governance mechanisms are therefore likely to be ineffective.

Scholars and practitioners have recently devoted considerable attention to boards of directors, but far more research is needed. We still know little about how boards actually work and how their behavior may be improved to contribute to value creation. During more than two decades agency theory has been the dominant theory in studies about boards of directors. When relaxing some of the assumptions in agency theory several new pathways for new research arise. To present new perspectives on board research we follow in this essay some of the pathways arising from relaxing agency theory assumptions about complete contracts. Alternative theoretical approaches, research questions and methods are suggested. (c) 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Interactions between CEOs and their boards of directors are a prominent focus of management and strategy research. Despite the extensive literature on CEO-board relations, to date there has been limited integration of theoretical perspectives and measurement schemes. Through an extensive analysis of published studies, we hope to facilitate future research on CEO-board relations. We begin with a comparison of key theoretical approaches. Next, we conduct a content analysis of 51 empirical articles. We find that prior studies have an unbalanced focus regarding both topics and theoretical perspectives, and that there is limited consistency in the choice of measures. Based on this review, we lay out a number of promising directions for future research. We also find that, while there has been progress in international research on CEO-board relations, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the generalizability of governance theories across different geographic settings.

Each year shareholders, via exercise of their proxy votes, have the opportunity to voice their support or displeasure with firms and director nominees. Examining over 2,000 Fortune 500 director nominees, we explore those indicators available to shareholders at the time of directors' (re)election to provide insight into shareholder discontent with director monitoring. By studying actual voting behaviors, we provide new perspective to understanding director elections as a governance process. Employing a multilevel approach, we find support for agency-theoretic relationships between several firm and director characteristics and shareholder opposition to directors seeking (re)election to the board. At the firm level, we find that CEO compensation level and board size are positively related to the withholding of shareholder votes in director elections, a behavior indicative of shareholder discontent. Complementing these findings, at the director level, we find that affiliated director status, tenure, and number of outside directorships are positively related, and director block ownership is negatively related to shareholder discontent with director monitoring.

In this study, we examine whether the presence of a founder influences the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and company performance in a sample of European, publicly traded, family firms. Our findings contradict the widespread belief that smaller and more independent boards as well as nondual leadership structures always lead to better firm performance, suggesting that agency theory is limited in its explanation of the relationship between board characteristics and firm performance. We find a positive effect of board size on business performance in nonfounder-led family firms and a negative effect of board size on founder-led family businesses. The presence of independent directors on the board has a positive effect on performance when a firm is run by its founder. However, when descendants lead the firm, the presence of independent directors has a negative effect on performance. Although the effect of board meetings on firm performance is positive, this relationship is weaker when the family business is run by its founder. Finally, CEO duality improves firm performance when descendants run the business, although CEO duality has no effect on performance when the firm is led by the founder. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Offering an integrated approach, this study examines the relationship between board composition and board processes in Italian family businesses. The potential beneficial effects of outside board members on board processes such as effort norms, cohesiveness, and use of knowledge and skills are highlighted. Using a sample of 90 family business directors, it was found that boards with outside directors are perceived as more committed to the board's tasks (i.e., higher effort norms) and more cohesive. Boards of older companies with outside directors are percevied as more capable of using knowledge and skills. (c) The Author(s) 2011.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: The origins of the global financial crisis have been attributed to the combination of a housing price bubble and innovative financial instruments, as well as the lack of restraint by corporate executives and boards to engage in excessive risk-taking. The rise in subprime lending between 1997 and 2005 played a crucial role in inflating the housing price bubble. We take a unique dataset of US financial institutions heavily engaged in subprime lending and ask the following research question: Did board configuration play a role in determining whether a financial institution specialized in subprime lending? Research Findings/Insights: We use a matched-pair sample of firms in the financial industry from 1997-2005 with half of the sample specializing in subprime lending and conduct panel data logistic regression analysis. We find that the board configurations of those financial institutions that engaged in subprime lending were significantly different from those that did not. Specifically, subprime lenders had boards that were busier, had less tenure, and were less diverse with respect to gender. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study uses the group decision making perspective in the context of subprime lending to examine board of director configuration and its influence on decision making processes around the issue of risky subprime lending. Findings show that how boards were configured did influence the decision to specialize in subprime lending. We find robust support for predictions based on the group decision making perspective. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The deterioration of mortgage lending requirements that gave rise to the defaults of so many subprime loans, in retrospect, appears to be something that should have been entirely preventable. By demonstrating that subprime specialists had significant differences in board configuration that impacted group decision making, this study offers guidance to policymakers considering additional regulation and for corporate officers examining corporate governance issues.

Prior research shows that firms benefit from the social capital of their boards of directors but has not explored the antecedents of new director social capital. We argue that firms can attract directors with social capital by offering more compensation. We also argue that more complex firms (firms with a greater scale and scope of operations) are more attractive to such directors because of the greater experience and exposure that such directorships provide. Similarly, we argue that firms with high-status directors on their current boards will be more attractive to directors with social capital. We analyse the social capital of new outside directors added to boards of semiconductor firms between 1993 and 2007. Surprisingly, we find no support for the hypothesis that higher compensation is associated with adding directors with high status or board ties. However, firm complexity is associated with the ability to add new directors who have social capital, and the status of current board members is associated with the ability to add new directors who also have high status.

In the slipstream of several large-scale corporate scandals, the board of directors has gained a pivotal position in the corporate governance debate. However, due to an overreliance on particular methodological (i. e. input-output studies) and theoretical (i. e. agency theory) research fortresses in past board research, academic knowledge concerning how this important governance mechanism actually operates and functions remains relatively limited. This theoretical paper aims to contribute to the promising stream of research which focuses on behavioural perspectives and processes within the corporate board, by delving into one of the research areas perhaps plagued most by these predominant approaches: board leadership. In adopting a team perspective on the board of directors our study goes beyond traditional board leadership research, which has turned a blind eye on actual leadership dynamics, by examining leadership processes and behaviours inside the board team. Specifically, we develop a conceptual framework addressing a novel and ethical approach to team leadership within the board, i. e. shared leadership, which has previously been demonstrated to result in performance benefits in various other team settings.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of prior firm performance on board composition and governance structure. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 90 companies listed on National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations were used for this study. Hypotheses were tested using both general linear regression and logit regression analyses. Findings: The results showed that prior negative change in firm performance was significantly related to a decrease in the overall number of directors and a decrease in the number of outside directors. Research limitations/implications: The sample size used in this study was relatively small and the focus was on small to medium-sized firms, so the results found here may not apply to firms larger than those used in our sample. Practical implications: Directors may want to consider the implications for governance practices found in this study, specifically, whether smaller boards with fewer outsiders are appropriate following periods of performance decline. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to examine the effects of trends in prior firm performance on board composition and chief executive officer duality.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: This study examines the conditions under which foreign subsidiaries maintain active boards of directors. Active boards are in this study defined as boards that perform tasks beyond fulfilling local legal requirements. We focus on both monitoring and service roles. Research Findings/Insights: Based on a sample of 83 foreign subsidiaries operating in Belgium with headquarters in 14 different countries, we find that a foreign subsidiary is more likely to maintain an active board if it is a world mandate subsidiary, which has worldwide responsibility for a product line and performs a broad scope of value-added activities. Moreover, a foreign subsidiary is more likely to maintain an active board if it is larger relative to the multinational enterprise (MNE), if it has a higher level of local responsiveness, and if its past performance is poorer. Additionally, the presence of an active board in a foreign subsidiary is related to other control mechanisms deployed in the subsidiary. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results highlight the conditions under which foreign subsidiaries are likely to maintain active boards. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence that agency theory and resource dependence theory are relevant and complementary in the analysis of active boards in foreign subsidiaries. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that an active board may be a control mechanism to govern foreign subsidiaries and an instrument to deal with the external environment. Corporate governance regulators may consider developing governance recommendations that emphasize the importance of subsidiary boards in the oversight of foreign subsidiaries.

Purpose - Despite the extensive study of director interlocks very little is known about gendered director networks. Boards of directors are primarily male; globally, only 5-20 per cent of directors are women and change is described as glacially slow. The extent to which women directors are central to the network, or pushed to the margins, is unknown. Using the tools of social network analysis we extract the components of three director networks, a global and two national networks and locate the women directors. The paper aims to examine the persistence of director networks over time to determine whether gender related differences - apart from size - contribute to the apparent resistance to change. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses a longitudinal approach, comparing director networks on a global network scale (2004 and 2007 Fortune Global 200) and a national one (2004 and 2007 New Zealand Stock Exchange) with the iconic 1999 Fortune US 1000 dataset. After extracting the largest connected component, the female directors are separated out. From the 2004 and 2007 data director turnover is calculated to determine the stability of the networks. Findings - Female directors are more likely to be found in the largest connected component of the mixed gender network, indicating that they are not marginalised. Despite high turnover rates, director networks are stable over time which may manifest as resistance to change. Originality/value - The structure of gendered director networks is unknown and the location of women directors in the network components has not been considered in board diversity research. The results point to an underlying gender equity in all director networks. A new theoretical approach, glass network theory, has implications for boardroom diversity interventions.

In the wake of this decade's corporate scandals, crimes and excesses, improving the effectiveness of corporate governance in the United States has become a priority. An important influence on a board's effectiveness at monitoring is its members degree of independence from senior management. While the current definition of independence revolves around the absence of familial and economic connections between a firm and its directors, research suggests that this standard may be inadequate in ensuring independent oversight. Rather, diversity along racial, gender and other dimensions has been proposed as a potentially more effective standard for board independence. This is especially welcome news for women, who currently comprise 51 per cent of the US managerial workforce but only 14.8 per cent of the directors on boards of large, publicly traded US corporations. Some explain the current dearth of women board members by claiming that there are no qualified women available for board service and/or that women are not interested in board service. However, there is more anecdotal rather than empirical evidence on the issue. Surveying women at a women's leadership conference in Boston, this research investigates the extent to which women are currently involved in some type of board service and the extent to which women aspire to future board service. We find that women are currently more active in governance activities than prior research on corporate boards suggests and that they aspire to play a continued and expanded role in governance activities.

The concept of stakeholder engagement is gaining increasing attention in the mainstream media and may feature as part of a corporation's strategy for corporate social responsibility. Not only are boards considering how they might engage with key stakeholders, but stakeholders are also pursuing greater participation in the strategic decisions of companies in which they invest. While this is an emerging concept in companies governed by unitary boards, as in North America, the issue of stakeholder engagement in various forms is also entering debate in other countries around the world. In general, however, the idea of shareholder or stakeholder representation on the boards of most UK and Commonwealth companies is anathema. Forces now influencing the development of strategies for stakeholder engagement and the rise of active investors include changing corporate governance rules which give investors more power in the election of directors, the increasing role of pension plans and hedge fund investment groups which have produced investors who keep a close eye on company performance and value, and a sluggish or turbulent stock market as a result of the financial crisis initiated by the credit crunch in the sub-prime mortgage markets. In this paper the phenomenon of stakeholder representation is examined and results of a recent survey conducted among a large sample of New Zealand directors are presented. The findings suggest that these traditionally oriented boards are increasingly inwardly focused and are without an agenda for building and managing shareholder and stakeholder relations. Accordingly, such boards are unlikely to regard stakeholder engagement as a serious strategic issue and are thus also likely to miss significant opportunities in the changed business environment to benefit from stakeholder support.

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to draw on the perspectives and experiences of New Zealand board members to propose a balanced scorecard (BSC) for use in measuring and managing the performance of boards. Design/methodology/approach The views of 35 board members were elicited via semi-structured interviews. The interview evidence was analysed using a multi-step coding process to arrive at key themes on the functions, characteristics and outcomes of effective and ineffective boards. These themes were then used as a basis for proposing an appropriate structure and content for a BSC that reflects board members' perceptions of key factors driving board performance. Findings New Zealand board members see behavioural measures of board performance as generally more useful than operational and financial measures. Further, strong relationships and strategic clarity are seen as both drivers of good performance and key outcomes of effective boards. Consequently, the proposed BSC incorporates multi-dimensional outcome (i.e. lagging) measures. It also recognises the importance of including subjective measures, rather than focusing on readily quantifiable measures that board members perceive as less informative. Research limitations/implications This paper provides insight into the perspectives of practising board members and informs the literature on board effectiveness. The proposed BSC adds to the performance management literature in regard to evaluating and managing the performance of boards. However, further studies are now required to test its practical utility. Practical implications The proposed BSC provides a potentially useful tool for evaluating the performance of boards of directors. Originality/value Few studies of board effectiveness have accessed the views and experiences of practising board members as this study does. Also, little prior research exists on the potential for applying a BSC approach to measuring and managing board performance. (c) Copyright - 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose: Amid ongoing criticism that corporate boards do not receive adequate information to help them fulfill their current and emerging roles, the purpose of this paper is to focus on the type of information directors receive. Specifically, to examine whether greater board independence and greater board expertise were associated with receiving more information, in five specific categories. Design/methodology/approach: Hypotheses about the relationships between the composition of corporate boards and the various types of information they receive were tested by means of a survey of 161 Canadian companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Findings: The authors findings indicate a strong association between board expertise and each type of information received and suggest a weaker relationship between board independence and information received. Specifically, the results demonstrate that more independent boards do not receive larger amounts of information that is more forward-looking in nature. Research limitations/implications: These findings contribute to the literature on governance by providing relevant empirical evidence, based on primary data on board information issues. However, these results must be interpreted within the context of the use of various perceptual measures. Practical implications: Now that the composition of corporate boards has changed considerably, the findings of this study underline the need to re-examine the supporting information processes. Hence, this study should help provide guidance to organizations examining the content of their current information strategy. Originality/value: An important contribution of this study is its detailed characterization of the information provided to corporate boards, including financial and non-financial information and reflecting the five traditional stages of the strategic management process.

Boards of directors are a vital part of corporate governance systems. In the on-going discussion about the development of national corporate governance systems, however, little interest has been given to the issue of how and why board behavior changes over time. In this article, we use an institutional approach and study the development of board behavior in Sweden between 1994 and 2004 and if it is affected by board composition and board network characteristics. In order to do so, we introduce the constructs of board activities, i. e. what the boards do, and board involvement, i.e. when in the decision process they get involved. Findings show that range of board activities and board involvement have increased drastically during this period, which indicates a change in the logic of appropriateness of Swedish board behavior. There are robust indications that new types of actors affect activities and involvement positively, as do board interlocks, whereas network centrality affects activities and involvement negatively.

Identifying, attracting, and maintaining the engagement of the right composition of people for a non-profit Board is a major challenge. Executives should ensure that their Boards accurately represent the stakeholders that matter, both from industry and the community. The purpose of this paper is to describe ways and offer propositions for effective non-profit executives to identify, recruit, and motivate the continuing engagement of the members needed on their Boards in order to acquire resources critical to their sustained success. The Convention and Visitors Bureaus (CVBs) are used as an example, since at least 93 percent of CVBs have a governance structure that includes a Board of Directors. Successfully attracting the right mix of stakeholders is a result of an extensive recruitment effort by the CVB executive. Prior research reports that successful executives take great care in making selection decisions that reflect the interests of the community in the Board's composition. Based on the literature on Boards and governance, the authors develop propositions regarding the composition of CVB Boards. While the research is exploratory, it is found that CVBs with more diverse Boards are more successful than those with less diverse Boards. It is argued that effective CVBs use a thoughtful process for heterogeneous Board selection. It is also suggested that Board performance should be evaluated on an annual basis to recognize the need for active involvement in the Board selection process. The successful selection of Board members is important because of the implications for Board effectiveness. While there is a large body of literature offering advice on Board selection, there is little on recruitment. Moreover, there is little discussion of Board composition strategy based on balancing access to critical resources of stakeholders. (c) 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

The theoretical framework for a comprehensive trust model is presented using McAllister's affect- and cognitive-based trust model and Siegrist, Earle, and Gutscher's trust-confidence-cooperation model as the foundation. The enhanced model includes cognitive and affective domains of personality, culture, motivation, reliability, competence, and intuition (as a latent variable) to measure perception of trust between two individuals. The model applies the intercognition of self-leadership for improving trust and building effective relationships within boards of directors. Furthermore, the authors consider the multiplicity of board of director roles and how such complexity affects formation and maintenance of optimal trust. (c) Baker College 2011.

This paper studies the relationship between personal stock donation by top executives and board of directors (insiders) of publicly traded corporations and their personal tax, shareholders' returns, and social responsibility. The study finds evidence that the timing of stock donations is driven by personal tax gain. The study further shows, comparing stock gift corporations relative to their non-stock gift cohorts, that personal stock gifts are associated with lower short-term and long-term stock returns to shareholders. This implies that stock donation driven by insiders' personal gain adversely affects shareholder wealth. However, the likelihood and intensity of insiders to make personal stock donation is reduced when firms have strong corporate social responsibility (CSR). Agency theory explains insiders' opportunistic behavior, stakeholder theory is also supported by evidence that stock donation is negatively related to CSR, and stewardship theory offers a different view to explain the rationale behind insiders' stock donation and shareholders' reactions to stock gifts.

What is a board of directors to do, in the face of competing demands on the resources of the company and conflicting perspectives on what their roles are and should be? Corporate governance has become a central theme in management in the past two decades owing to a string of major corporate failures and evidence that the boards of these companies either failed to grasp the scale of the problems or failed to stand up to managers. Those corporations might have set out upon the wrong strategy, or engaged in fraud, or unethical behaviour, or simply suffered from bad luck. Their failures have led to a debate both with industry and in public policy about what mechanisms might prevent a recurrence, not least because they show how great the influence of the corporate sector is on society at large. In this chapter we consider how boards contribute to governing the corporation, the tensions they face along the way, and how theories of corporate governance point to the persistence of those tensions.

This research examines how the board of directors affects the relationship between Research and Development (R&D) investment and firm performance. The study, conducted on a sample of French companies listed on Euronext Paris, shows that the relationship between R&D investment and firm performance is significantly positive. However, this relationship varies significantly with the characteristics of the board of directors. Specifically, the results show that board independence, chief executive officer and chairman duality and the number of board meetings have a positive effect on the R&D investment-firm performance relationship, whereas board size affects this relationship negatively.

Drawing on Agency Theory this article investigates the relationship between board size and European firms' performance. The focus is on the implicit differences between financial and non-financial firms. In particular the paper addresses the following questions: does board size influence firm performance? Is financial intermediaries' corporate governance different from that of non-financial companies? The study analyses the governance of the largest listed European companies which make up the Eurotop 100 index. Companies come from 12 different countries and are subject to different regulatory and self-discipline codes. Referring to the Eurotop index the focus is on the relation between the overall size of the board of directors and the level of performance measured as Tobin's Q and Return on Assets. Diverging results emerge depending on the typology of the firm. In particular, results suggest that for non-financial companies large boards negatively influence firm performance, whereas financial intermediaries seem to be different because of the non-relation between their board size and performance.

The role of boards in firm strategy has long been the subject of debate. Over the last four decades, research on the relationship between boards of directors and strategy has proliferated. Ye t to date there is little theoretical and empirical study regarding the question of how board information affects the boards of directors' strategic involvement. Using a survey data from 104 responses of chairpersons collected in the year of 2010 in China, we examine how board information affects boards' behaviors of strategic involvement. Our study shows that quality of information, information diversity, frequency of board interaction, and proactive seeking information positively influence boards' strategy monitoring and advisory. These findings provide empirical support for agency theory and resource dependence theory on boards. (c) 2011 IEEE.

In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, many industrialized States have increased their stakes in corporations (State-owned enterprises) worldwide. Therefore, the idea of governments as value-creating institution is increasing and questions concerning innovation are even more pressing. Indeed, there has been a great deal of both scholarly and professional interest in innovation believing that it is essential to public sector effectiveness. Theoretical insights from the innovation literature, agency and resource-based theories are done seeking to add knowledge on the relationships between governance mechanisms and State-owned enterprises' innovation. The analysis is on a sample of 88 Norwegian State-owned enterprises mainly operating in the service sector. The results show that some characteristics of the board of directors (e.g., composition, board working-style and board members' knowledge and competences) significantly influence innovation types. Implications for theory and practice and future research directions are discussed. (c) 2011, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The purpose of this paper is to compare the levels of representation of women on boards of directors in five countries, and especially to determine if the culture of a country is a factor that influences the possibility of women achieving positions on boards of directors. We use the cultural dimensions of Hofstede (1980) and GLOBE (House et al., 2004), and the results show that the culture of a country can be a factor in explaining the different levels of representation of women at board of directors. In particular, three of the four cultural dimensions are seen to be significant: power distance, uncertainty avoidance and masculinity.

This study considers the legitimacy of shareholder activism as a means of exercising influence in the corporate decision-making process and identifies self-reformed boards as a superior solution to the issues that activists attempt to address. We conceptualise the board of directors' role as representing the interests of multiple principals. When any one principal is able to serve its own interests by influencing corporate decision-making through shareholder activism, other principals' interests may be compromised. We argue that a better long-term solution lies not with activist shareholders, but with culturally reformed boards. We suggest a set of self-reform initiatives that would help them to achieve their potential. We develop a conceptual framework for the arguments in favour of boards taking a leadership role in corporate engagement with shareholders and stakeholders. To the extent that boards are unable to implement self-reform, governments may need to develop public policy initiatives for corporate governance reform. (c) 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The literature on the relationships between board attributes and corporate performance is mixed, and one important reason is that the intermediate variable, i.e., board behaviors are ignored. With the data coming from listed company of China, the paper empirically researches the relationship between the characteristics and monitoring function of board. Using Principal Component Analysis, we get 6 variables reflecting the characteristics of board and 4 variables for the monitoring function. The study shows that the share held ratio of board's members has a negative impact on the directing function of board significantly, but the gender ratio and the average age of board members has a positive impact on the position function of board significantly. This may be valuable to regulate the behavior of board. (c) 2011 IEEE.

This paper explores board decision-making in social enterprises. It argues that while dominant theoretical frameworks (agency and stakeholder theories) help to understand the challenges faced by the boards of social enterprises, they need to be complemented to account, more adequately, for challenges deriving from the confounding logics framing valuations of organizational effectiveness in social enterprises. The paper identifies pace of decision-making as a crucial variable that requires further research attention and, building on the literature on group decision and dynamics, it advances several factors that can frame the expediency (or sluggishness) with which the boards of social enterprises take decisions.

This paper examines the effects of director ownership and the proportion of outside directors on firms' commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR). Using a sample of 453 Hong Kong listed companies for 2005, we find that there is a non-linear relationship between the level of director ownership and firms' engagement in CSR behavior. Commitment to CSR first increases as the proportion of director ownership increases up to 50% and then decreases as that proportion of ownership grows higher. Further, the proportion of outside directors on the board exhibits a positive relationship with the level of CSR commitment. These results provide explanations for firms' commitment to CSR from the corporate governance perspective.

Corporate governance scholars are increasingly interested in firms' social and environmental performance. Empirical research in this area, however, has moved forward in an uncoordinated fashion, producing fragmented and contradictory results. Our paper seeks to address this situation by adopting a fact-based research approach that comprehensively explores the link between corporate governance and environmental performance. Specifically, we aim to understand how the relationships between and among the firms' owners, managers, and boards of directors influence environmental performance. We are particularly interested in understanding the interactions among these three key sets of actors. In the end, we offer some observations about governance practices and discuss the implications for theory. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Drawing on stakeholder theory, this paper examines the relationship of board composition, leadership and structure on sustainability disclosure. We discuss that good corporate governance and sustainability disclosure can be seen as complementary mechanisms of legitimacy that companies may use to dialogue with stakeholders. Specifically we claim that, as disclosure policies emanate from the board of directors, sustainability disclosure may be a function of the board attributes: we investigate the relationship between different characteristics of the board and sustainability disclosures among US and European companies. Our results show that in order to explain the effect of board composition on sustainability disclosure we need to go beyond the narrow and traditional distinction between insider and independent directors, focusing on the specific characteristics of each director.

This research focuses on family-controlled firms as an important type of family firms, and demonstrates how external parties in the governance (ownership and board of directors) can serve as a catalyst for their internationalization. Our framework also embraces the moderating effects of the competitive environmental heterogeneity and past performance on the relationship between external, nonfamily involvement in governance, and internationalization (scale and scope). The hypotheses are tested on a sample of 351 Swedish family-controlled firms. Our findings extend previous research on family firms and their internationalization, especially addressing some of the prior mixed findings, and offers implications for both theory and practice.

Director selection is a critical board process and outcome that influences the board and its overall performance. Because of this influence, research from a variety of different disciplinary areas examines the antecedents and outcomes of director selection. The authors offer a synthesis of this literature from these different disciplines. The authors first delineate the process that drives the selection of an individual to a board. They then review and categorize the director selection literature into two distinct perspectives-a rational economic perspective focused on the organization-level benefits driving the selection decision and a socialized perspective emphasizing the social processes that influence the director selection process. Finally, from their review, the authors suggest promising areas of future research regarding director selection. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Purpose: Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, the study aims to link board demographic diversity and independence to corporate social performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from various sources for a sample of 475 publicly traded Fortune 500 companies between the years 2007 and 2008. Findings: It is found that board gender diversity is positively related to institutional and technical strength ratings, while board racial diversity is positively related to institutional strength rating only. Both the proportion of outside directors and CEO non-duality were negatively associated with institutional and technical weakness ratings. Research limitations/implications: The sample was predominantly large, publicly traded national and international corporations, which might limit the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: Management personnel should be cognizant of how board configurations and leadership structure may influence their corporate reputation for social responsibility. Efforts should be made to foster a group dynamic that is conducive to effective board functioning. Originality/value: Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between board characteristics and corporate social performance. This study contributes to the literature by examining such associations. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper investigates the role of board structure and the effect of ownership structures on firm performance in New Zealand's listed firms. Several studies, the majority from the U.S., U.K. and Japan, have examined the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms, ownership structure and firm performance. Those studies yielded different results, affected by the nature of the prevailing governance system for each country. Investigating New Zealand's listed firms could enhance the diversity of the growing body of work that examines this relationship. Though the majority of studies only tested a linear relationship between variables, a number of studies have found a non-linear relationship between board structures, ownership structures and firm performance, and this study confirms the non-linear relationship. Using a balanced panel of 79 New Zealand listed firms, this study employs a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) for robustness. The result reveals that board of directors, board committees, and managerial ownership have a positive and significant impact on firm performance. Meanwhile, nonexecutive directors, female directors on the board and blockholder ownership lower New Zealand firm performance.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: To what extent can group faultlines and their potential value-destroying effects be detected on corporate boards? Task-related attributes of the type of directorship, education, board tenure, and financial background of board members are considered as directors' characteristics that give rise to the faultline phenomenon. The impact of task-related faultlines on firm performance as well as the moderating effects of busy boards, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) tenure, executive directors' (EDs) compensation structure, and the average non-executive directors' (NEDs) involvement in board committees are examined. Research Findings/Insights: Using a panel of FTSE 350 companies from 1999 to 2008, we find a strong negative effect of task-related faultlines on firm performance. Further exploration of the moderating effects demonstrates that the condition of a busy board and CEO tenure exacerbate the negative effects of faultlines. At the same time, the executive pay contingency is found to have a remedying effect on boardroom cohesiveness, whereas the involvement of NEDs in board committee work is not likely to make the adverse effects of board faultlines less pronounced. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Based on the arguments of social identity theory, this study shows that task-related faultlines on corporate boards have strong negative value-creating implications. The positive moderating impact of the executive compensation structure renders support to agency theory predictions about executive incentive alignment. This work also underlines the usefulness of the concept of faultlines in the corporate governance literature, because unitary boards, where NEDs and EDs share board responsibility, exhibit pre-existing factions, similar to top management teams of family-controlled firms and teams managing international joint-ventures. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This research points to the importance of a careful selection process of directors by nomination committees. It also underlines the role for active leadership on boards, who should be aware of available strategies to ameliorate the negative consequences of board schisms, such as accentuating superordinate board identity and/ or informal meetings.

Previous research brought evidence of the influence of board composition for bringing strategic resources for innovation, as well as evidence of positive outcomes of board diversity. Only a few studies have investigated the effects of various indicators of board diversity on innovation. In this paper, we will explore the relationship between several aspects of board diversity (gender and age) and four types of innovation, i.e. product, process, organizational, marketing from a sample of 176 French firms based on data from French Community Innovation Survey (CIS) in 2008 and annual reports. Our results show evidence of the influence of board diversity on all types of innovation except process innovation. Findings provide discussions for the impact of board diversity on innovation.

Directors may play their most important role during organizational crisis; however, extant research suggests that they are often more willing to exit than remain on the board of a firm facing a crisis. We develop theory regarding directors' voluntary exit by integrating insights from identity theories with the organizational crises literature. Specifically, we model how directors' individual, relational, and collective identities work sometimes in concert and other times in opposition to each other to influence directors' voluntary decisions to remain on or exit from a board facing an organizational crisis.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: The global financial crisis in 2008 has generated increasing recognition of the importance of board diversity reflected amidst the capabilities and skills of directors on a board. As the primary institutional mechanism designed to strengthen the director selection process, nomination committees (NCs) occupy centre stage of this discussion. However, there is a dearth of studies which focus either specifically on NCs or on diversity as a board composition outcome. In this study, we examine the research question of the likely antecedents in terms of NC characteristics of two board composition outcomes, i.e., diversity as variety in terms of gender and nationality, and diversity as separation in terms of a board demographic faultline. Research Findings/Insights: For a panel of FTSE350 companies from 1999 to 2008, we find that the increasing presence on the NC of females or non-British nationals is likely to have a positive impact on the level of board gender and nationality diversity, respectively. In addition, we report that the presence of the chief executive officer (CEO) on the NC is found to interact with the NC independence, as a result of which a board demographic faultline is likely to emerge. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We bring together three concepts from social psychology research to create the theoretical basis for our study of the influence of NCs on board diversity: these are similarity-attraction, homosocial reproduction, and social identity. The strong empirical findings suggest that these socio-psychological dimensions are applicable to the operations of NCs, which has implications for the outcomes of the director nomination and selection process, and consequently also for board composition. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research indicates that NC characteristics are significant antecedents of board diversity, hence composition of the NC is an important step and pre-requisite for assembling a diverse board. For example, appointing females and/or non-nationals to the NC increases the likelihood of greater representation of females and/or non-nationals on the entire board. At the same time, our evidence suggests that the presence of the CEO amidst the majority of non-executive directors (NEDs) on the NC is detrimental for board cohesiveness.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine whether director interlocks enable or inhibit a firm's adoption of a proactive environmental strategy. Specifically, using resource dependence theory, we argue that director interlocks with suppliers are linked to varying likelihoods that a firm adopts a proactive environmental strategy, depending on the relation between the provided resources and the environmental approach. Research Findings/Insight: Based on a sample of US electric firms, our results show that director interlocks with firms providing knowledge-intensive business services are positively linked to the adoption of proactive environmental strategies. However, director interlocks with firms providing financial resources and fossil fuel are negatively related to the adoption of these strategies for our sample. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Board linkages may enable and inhibit proactive environmental strategies. We contribute to resource dependence theory by offering empirical evidence that the reduction of uncertainty about critical resources by director interlocks may either make business change easier or constrict a firm's autonomy, making change more difficult. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The influence of interlocking directors varies depending on the type of resources that director interlocks transfer to their organizations. As a result, the selection of specific director interlocks can become very important to the strategic goals of the firm. Regulators should continue to pay attention to potential risks for other stakeholders from director interlocks. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

There is a growing consensus that boards of directors "matter," but the specific effects of board influences on organizational innovation remain unclear. Although boards of directors have been studied extensively in diverse disciplines-finance, management, sociology, nonprofit management, and economics-those studies have focused primarily on how board variables influence organizational effectiveness and performance. Missing from these studies is explanation of the relationships between the board of directors and organizational innovation (Wu, 2008a). This article links previous research and theories on governance and organizational innovation, examines how the board of directors may influence organizational innovation, and presents an integrative model that includes direct and indirect linkages between the board demographic and process variables, board effectiveness, and organizational innovation.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the effects of corporate governance factors on the firm performance and executive compensation linkage. Specifically, we examine how domestic corporate-appointed directors, bank-appointed directors and foreign ownership moderate the relationship between firm profitability, sales growth, and executive bonus pay in Japanese firms. Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of the largest Japanese manufacturing companies from 1997 to 2007, we find that corporate-appointed directors positively moderate the relationship between firm growth and bonus pay, while foreign shareholders exhibit a positive moderating effect on the relationship between firm profitability and bonus pay. Bank-appointed directors are straddled between their profitability orientation and relational role: They link firm profitability and bonus pay, but also show positive influence on the firm growth and bonus pay relationship. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study makes a contribution to research on ownership heterogeneity and executive compensation by empirically showing that different owners and directors affiliated with certain ownership groups have varied implications on the firm performance-executive pay relationship. It also makes a contribution to research on corporate governance change by providing insights on how different actors facilitate shifts in the linkage between performance and pay. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our findings offer insights to stakeholders to pay attention to ownership structure and board composition in acknowledging the varied financial motivation of executives to pursue growth and/or profitability.

This article brings together research on philanthropy, family business, and governance to examine patterns of giving by U.S. family versus nonfamily independent foundations. The authors use a sample comprising the 200 largest U.S. independent foundations in 2007 to show that family foundations are more focused in their grantmaking than nonfamily foundations. Board size moderates this relationship. They also offer a new typology of family foundations to show that the generation stage of the family and the foundation board's composition are associated with different levels of grantmaking diversity in family foundations but in dissimilar ways. Scholarly and practical implications are discussed. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Although there is a paucity of female corporate directors in Canada, women are slowly managing to break the gender barrier of all-male boards of directors. Using resource dependency theory a model is developed that identifies the human capital characteristics that contribute to a woman being appointed to an all-male board. The model is tested on a sample of 193 Canadian firms that appointed women to their boards of directors between 1996 and 2004. The results show that women who are appointed to all-male boards have specialized knowledge skills; either they have firm-specific knowledge as insiders, or they are support specialists with a specific financial or legal expertise.

Owner-managers of private family businesses are vulnerable to escalation of commitment, which can lead to costly failure. In an effort to help private family businesses reduce such costs and contribute to the resource dependence literature, we extend prior research on escalation of commitment (Staw, 1981). Specifically, we develop a model that examines how outside board members influence the antecedents, and moderate the processes, that lead to escalation of commitment. Our work encourages the use of outside board members, insofar as they are likely to help the owner-managers of private family businesses to avoid escalation of commitment. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper investigates the effect of new governmental regulations on corporate Boards of Directors (BODs). We have reviewed the literature pertaining to agency theory and resource dependency theory, both of which have been assumed to explain the actions of BODs. We examine the predictions of both agency theory and resource dependence theory regarding both the structure and actions of BODs in times of governmental regulatory change. We then describe four historical events in which radical changes were required by certain governmental regulations, and discuss responses by BODs to each event, and present a discussion of these responses and how they adhere to or stray from the predictions of both agency theory and resource dependence theory. We conclude the paper with recommendations for the direction of further study.

Corporatization, or the adoption of more business-like practices or governance arrangements by government agencies, has been shown to lead to improvements in performance. However, why corporatization leads to improved performance is not well understood. There are competing theories as to how corporatization may improve performance, but because of confounding factors empirical studies have difficulty in identifying causal relationships. We address these issues in our analysis of the corporatization of six Australian state forest agencies that took place in the past two decades, focusing on: (1) improvements in efficiency and (2) improved profitability or cost recovery. The results confirm that corporatization leads to enhanced commercial performance through improving clarity around business decisions and increasing the autonomy of managers. A key feature is the establishment of new governance arrangements and how they are implemented. Our results suggest that mechanisms such as the creation of an "independent" board of directors are important to create an "arm's length" relationship between the government and the new entity, thereby improving clarity in business decisions.

Existing research on a board-of-director-sustainability performance relationship have largely examined inside directors, outside directors, and gender diversity-yet empirical results have yet to offer any definitive answers. I posit that this previous research lacks a thorough examination of the role of boards and the means and mechanisms by which they influence performance. Drawing on the board capital perspective and the role of boards, this paper develops a model that highlights the influence of board capital on the future sustainability performance of firms. The model takes into account specific types of human and social capital of outside directors which have previously been unexamined. Beyond the board capital perspective, an argument is put forth that values are largely neglected in the examination of boards of directors, but are necessary in the study of sustainability because of its normative implications. I therefore account for the value attunement concept as a moderating variable in the model The paper draws on corporate governance and business ethics' literature to generate propositions and offer original insight into the drivers of sustainability performance in organizations.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between the board diversity and the investments in innovation in a sample of companies listed on the Italian Stock Exchange (named Borsa Italiana) and operating in the consumer goods and in the consumer services industry. This sample covers the period from 2006 to 2010 and contains 345 observations. Drawing on the literature review, we pinpointed six hypotheses related to the impact on the investments in innovation of the following independent variables: 1. presence of outside directors; 2. average number of the other positions held by the members of the board; 3. minority shareholder representatives on the board; 4. presence of women on the board of directors; 5. number of committees; 6. frequency of board meetings. Furthermore, on the basis of the previous empirical studies, to measure the investments in innovation (the dependent variable), we chose these accounting ratios: total intangible assets divided by total assets and total R&D costs divided by total sales. From the methodology standpoint, we used both the bivariate statistic (i.e. Pearson Correlations and Anova one way) and the multivariate one (i.e. OLS regression analysis with robust standard errors calculated by the Newey-West, HAC method). Our findings confirm the previous studies and show that, also for the Italian listed companies operating in the industries mentioned earlier, the outsiders as well as the frequency of meetings held by the Strategy Committee assume a relevant role in supporting the investments in innovation. Conversely, the other independent variables concerning board diversity (i.e. women, minority shareholder representatives etc.) are not statistically significant and, as a result, do not influence the investments in innovation.

This study explored the role of strategic leadership in declining firms by empirically examining CEOs' founder status and extensiveness of external board of director appointments as predictors of the likelihood of successful turnaround. The authors used the resource dependence and board interlock literatures to develop their hypotheses. Their analysis of data collected from a matched pair of 82 turnaround and bankrupt U.S. firms indicate that the extensiveness of CEOs' external board appointments significantly increase the likelihood of turnaround. Contrary to the authors' prediction, there was no significant relationship between founder status and likelihood of turnaround. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

This study explains the inconsistent findings of previous research on board management by examining the direct and interaction effects of board independence and the top management team's external ties on firm performance. The results obtained using a multiyear sample of firms indicate that outsider-rich boards improved firm performance when they worked with top managers imported from outside the focal industry. On the other hand, a high proportion of outsiders on the board and top managers imported from the focal industry were not a desirable combination for firm performance. The findings imply that researchers and practitioners should pay more attention to identifying the conditions under which board competence aligns with top management. (c) eContent Management Pty Ltd.

Representation of women on boards is getting more and more attention these recent years (Hillman, Shropshire, & Cannella, 2007; Nielsen & Huse, 2010), all the more as recent influence by the legislator accelerates the pace of change. Indeed, in France, a new law adopted in January 2011 stated that the proportion of female directors should not be lower than 40% in all major companies. Most previous research focused on the impact of the presence of women in boards on performance, but there are few studies on female directors' networks. In order to help to better understand the ties at the origin of these networks, we study several characteristics and network ties of female directors of French companies belonging to the SBF 120 index and we compare them with male characteristics. We test the specificity of four types of board of directors' networks: attendance at the same elite educational institutions, use of business networks, civil servants' networks, and interlocking directorates.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: In this study, we investigated the effects of several factors related to nominating and compensation committee structure and process on the likelihood of employing backdated stock options. Research Findings/Insights: To test our hypotheses, we selected a sample of US firms that had been investigated for backdating stock options and a control group of similar sized US firms from the same industry that had not been investigated for backdating. Using an agency perspective, we found that when compared to companies within the same industries, firms using backdated stock options did not tend to utilize nominating committees, and structured their compensation committees so that they are smaller, and meet less frequently. We also found that their CEOs are more generously compensated. Consistent with agency theory, these findings indicate that companies using backdated stock option may possess compromised monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Despite being one of the most dominant management theories in recent history, little empirical evidence supports the validity of agency theory. In contrast to studies producing results calling into question the value of agency theory, we found significant results with regard to understanding the conditions under which agency problems might be promulgated. Also, our study contributes to the understanding of corporate governance by examining a variety of possible antecedents to the practice of backdated stock options and how boards and committees may be constructed to more effectively reduce the agency problem. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results provide important evidence concerning factors or situations associated with backdating, which will be instructive in designing remedies to curb such practices in the future. In particular, to reduce the likelihood of dating schemes such as backdated stock options, firms should consider utilizing nominating committees, and constructing committees with more members and requiring frequent meetings so that directors can be better positioned for the effective execution of their monitoring responsibilities of management.

This paper examines the role of corporate governance in non-profit sport organizations. Governance within the traditional business environment is a crucial issue for the ultimate success or failures of an entity. This study analyses if the structures and systems of governance within traditional business can be transferred to a sport organization. The various governance theories are examined to assess their applicability within a sport organization and the role of the board is also analyzed within the study. Finally, this paper examines areas of conflict which may arise relating to governance and concludes by offering a best practice approach to this integral issue within any modern sport organization.

How does a board of directors decide what is right? The contest over this question is frequently framed as a debate between shareholder value and stakeholder rights, between a utilitarian view of the ethics of corporate governance and a deontological one. This paper uses a case study with special circumstances that allows us to examine in an unusually clear way the conflict between shareholder value and other bases on which a board can act. In the autumn of 2010, the board of Liverpool Football Club sold the company to another investing group against the explicit wishes of the owners. The peculiar circumstances of this case provide insight into the conflict between ethical approaches to board decisions, allowing us to see certain issues more clearly than we can in listed corporations with many shareholders. What the analysis suggests is that the board saw more than one type of utility on which to base its ethical decision, and that one version resonated with perceived duties to stakeholders. This alignment of outcomes of strategic value with duties contrasted with the utility of shareholder value. While there are reasons to be cautious in generalizing, the case further suggests reasons why boards may reject shareholder value, in opposition to mainstream notions of corporate governance, without rejecting utility as a base of their decisions. Further, the partial alignment of duty and utility facilitates a pragmatic decision rather than one based on a priori claims. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Social activists and government agencies seek greater diversity on corporate boards without any considerations of firm or governance characteristics. Using a comprehensive dataset on over 8000 firms from 1996 through 2005, we explore the potential determinants of socially homogeneous boards based on the advisory and monitoring needs of a firm. We find that director-homogeneity is associated with lower advertising intensity, lower R&D intensity but greater firm risk. Director-homogeneity is also positively associated with measures of CEO influence such as CEO ownership, CEO tenure, non-independence of nominating committee and director ownership. Overall, the empirical evidence implies that firms choose social diversity on the board of directors based on the economic needs and existing governance structures. (c) 2018, SAGE Publications Ltd.

This study focuses on the role of corporate political resources in shaping firm strategy in an extension of resource dependence theory. Using a sample of 92 regional banks for the period 1997-2004 in Japan, this paper explores the effect of amakudari (translated as the appointment of former bureaucrats to the boards of directors of private organizations) on the performance and managerial risk-taking of banks. We found that amakudari networks have a negative impact on a bank's profitability in the post-bubble crisis era when firm-specific and other variables are controlled. In addition, the evidence shows that a bank appointing more ex-bureaucrats to its board of directors has a tendency to get involved in more risky lending activities. Furthermore, the empirical results of this study are also found to be robust using the Arellano-Bond GMM estimator.

This chapter considers the legitimacy of shareholder (also known as investor) activism as a means of exercising influence in the corporate decision-making process and identifies engaged boards as a superior solution to addressing issues that activists attempt to address. Drawing on ideas from multiple principal agency theory, the board of directors' wider role is conceptualized as representing the common interests of multiple principals who have both common and divergent interests. When any one principal is able to serve its own interests by influencing corporate decision-making through shareholder/ investor activism, other principals' interests may be compromised. A set of initiatives available to boards is suggested that focuses on the social dimension of their strategic governance role in mediating among multiple stakeholders to address their concerns while at the same time working towards the long-term sustainability of the business. The chapter highlights the application of multiple principal agency theory to the context of corporate governance, along with other concepts relating to the social dimension and the emerging relational perspective on board competence. From these perspectives it is proposed that the board takes a proactive role in leading this type of engagement, while at the same time recognizing that directors will need better relational skills than has traditionally been expected of them in fulfilling their fiduciary responsibilities.

This study addresses the call for the development of team effectiveness scales that take team context into account. It develops and validates a measurement scale for effectiveness in the specific context of boards of directors in family firms.
Results from a validation study based on 90 family businesses indicate that even if board task performance is associated with activities and roles that appear to represent differing views of effectiveness, they share a single, common line of inquiry. Moreover the study confirms that boards can be distinguished according to the degree to which they perceive themselves as more or less effective in performing certain roles. The scale demonstrates diagnostic properties that make it useful for practitioners as well as researchers. (c) 2012 Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

Board composition is a critical element in the ability of the board to impact firm outcomes. While much of this research has focused on size and independence, there is growing literature that investigates the composition of directors' demography, human capital, and social capital. The purpose of this article is to synthesize this diverse literature. The authors first review the literature on board demographics, human capital, and social capital composition research. In doing so, they highlight the theoretical and methodological approaches utilized. Finally, they suggest avenues for future research that can advance our understanding of the effects of board composition. (c) The Author(s) 2013.

Although the composition of the board of directors has important implications for different aspects of firm performance, prior studies tend to focus on financial performance. The effects of board composition on corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance remain an under-researched area, particularly in the period following the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). This article specifically examines two important aspects of board composition (i.e., the presence of outside directors and the presence of women directors) and their relationship with CSR performance in the Post-SOX era. With data covering over 500 of the largest companies listed on the U.S. stock exchanges and spanning 64 different industries, we find empirical evidence showing that greater presence of outside and women directors is linked to better CSR performance within a firm's industry. Treating CSR performance as the reflection of a firm's moral legitimacy, our study suggests that deliberate structuring of corporate boards may be an effective approach to enhance a firm's moral legitimacy.

We develop a contingency approach to explain how firm ownership influences the monitoring function of the board - measured as the magnitude of external audit fees contracted by the board - by extending agency theory to incorporate the resource dependence notion that boards have distinct incentives and abilities to monitor management. Analyses of data on Continental European companies reveal that while board independence and audit services are complementary when ownership is dispersed, this is not the case when ownership is concentrated - suggesting that ownership concentration and board composition become substitutes in terms of monitoring management. Additional analysis shows that the relationship between board composition and external audit fees is also contingent upon the type of the controlling shareholder.

In this article, we examine the factors determining the representation of women on boards of directors by considering three main questions. The first question deals with the relationship between characteristics of ownership and governance on one side, and female directorship on the other. The second major question concerns the demographic attributes of women directors, such as nationality, foreign experience, educational level, business expertise, and connections to external sources. The third important question refers to women in senior positions on French boards (e.g., as independent members or board subcommittee members) in relation to firm characteristics and women's demographic attributes. Our study focuses on French large- and mid-capitalized companies belonging to the SBF120 stock market index during a 5-year period running from 2000 to 2004. First, our results give evidence that the appointment of women directors is strongly related to family ownership and board or firm size. Second, the appointment of women directors is related to their professional services, valuable skills, and network links. Furthermore, we show that women face a double glass-ceiling problem, and note that French firms rely more on the demographic attributes of their women directors when they are appointed to senior board positions. Our study sheds light on issues concerning the law that comes into force in 2016, which imposes quotas of women members on boards of directors in French companies.

This study investigates the joint effect of corporate ownership and board of directors' diversity configurations on the success of strategic merger and acquisition (M&A) decisions. Board diversity is defined as the extent to which its demographic diversity as measured by the culture, nationality, gender and experience of its directors complements its statutory diversity. A theoretical framework linking ownership, board diversity and M&A strategic decision making is proposed and tested. Based on a sample of 289 M&A decisions undertaken by Canadian firms over the period 2000-2007, demographic diversity is found to have a clear and non-linear effect on M&A performance while statutory diversity is of limited influence. Ownership is found to influence the effect of diversity, making the relation finer and more precise. This has practical implications. First, statutory diversity is not sufficient for well-performing boards. Also, ownership is an important factor. The most advocated board diversity aimed at insuring the board's independence is not valid across all ownership configurations. From a public policy perspective, results provide support for the principles-based approach in governance. Governance regimes should encourage the search for a balance between board diversity and the need for cohesion that best serves the firm's purpose and obligations. (c) 2011 The Author(s).

This study asserts that the effects of board characteristics on firm innovation need to be evaluated with reference to contingency variables. A literature review suggests that relatively few studies adopt a contingency view when examining the outcomes of boards of directors. This study examines the influence on firm innovation of characteristics such as board size, outsider ratio and board diversity, and suggests that their influence is contingent upon firm size. The model is tested on a sample of Italian companies and finds support for the contingency hypothesis. This study advances research on boards of directors by emphasizing the importance of context.

In this article, we use a sample of Norwegian quoted companies in the period of 2001-2010 to explore whether the gender quota requiring 40 % female directors on corporate boards changes the likelihood of women being appointed to top leadership roles as board chairs or corporate CEOs. Our empirical results indicate that the gender quota and the resulting increased representation of female directors provide a fertile ground for women to take top leadership positions. The presence of female board chairs is positively associated with female directors' independence status, age and qualification, whilst the presence of female CEOs is positively related to the average qualification of female directors. Firms with older and better educated female directors are more likely to appoint female board chairs. The likelihood of female CEOs' appointment increases with the percentage of independent directors and directors' qualifications, especially those for female directors. Furthermore, the gender gaps with respect to qualification, board interlocks and nationality between female and male board chairs vanishes after Norwegian companies' full compliance to the quota in January 2008. However, the gender quota has no significant impact on the gender gaps between female and male directors after its full compliance. Our article thereby contributes to understanding how gender quotas, presence of female directors, percentage of female directors on boards and other board characteristics can determine the gender of top leaders of organizations.

This study investigates how a fundamental group decision-making bias referred to as group polarization can influence boards' acquisition premium decisions. The theory suggests that when prior premium experience would lead directors on average to support a relatively high premium prior to board discussions, they will support a focal premium that is even higher after discussions; but when directors' prior premium experience would lead them on average to support a relatively low premium prior to board discussions, they will support a focal premium that is even lower after discussions. Results provided strong support for the theory. Moreover, group polarization was reduced by demographic homogeneity among directors and by minority expertise but increased by board influence. This study introduces a fundamental group decision-making bias into governance research and explains how group processes can influence network diffusions. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Board diversity is important especially in countries which practice a one-tier board system, such as Malaysia. Under the system, board appointments are usually controlled by the firm's substantial shareholders, and as a result, directors are chosen based on "the old-boy" network or "people like us", who are typically middle-aged males and from similar ethnicity which could lead to "group think". Board diversity ensures breadth and depth of the board's judgments. To this end, this study examines board diversity of the top 100 non-financial Malaysian firms, specifically directors' gender, ethnicity and age and their effects on firm performance. Data are collected from the 2007 annual reports of the sample firms. The evidence indicates the lack of diversity of the Malaysian boards of directors. Results from the multivariate analyses reveal that gender diversity is negatively associated with Tobin's q and ROA. Age diversity is found to be negatively related to ROA. Ethnic diversity, on the other hand, is found to be positively associated with ROA. Hence, findings on the effect of board diversity and firm performance are mixed. Nevertheless, this study offers insights to policy makers in enhancing corporate governance in Malaysia where diversity is one of the areas that could strengthen the effectiveness of the board.

Much of the scholarship on boards of directors has examined either the control (i.e., monitoring) role or the resource dependence role that boards fill. Relatively little has examined the service role, wherein directors provide advice and guidance to management. This study builds on recent work exploring director expertise by asking how operational expertise on boards impacts firm performance. We find that having external COO/presidents on a board of directors positively impacts firm performance when the firm's operational efficiency is declining, but negatively impacts performance when the firm's operational efficiency is improving. We also find that other types of external executives serving as directors exhibit the opposite relationship, suggesting that the value of director expertise is context-dependent. We discuss the implications of these findings for director selection. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper investigates the impact of diversity on corporate philanthropy. Compared to previous studies that have considered the influence of board diversity and CEO gender on corporate philanthropy, this study introduces the concept of operational diversity, which is the implementation of diversity programs at management, employee, and supply chain levels, and further, it explains why operational diversity influences corporate philanthropy, by using the premises of resource dependence theory. Second, this study also investigates the influence of board diversity on corporate philanthropy. Third, this study uses a large sample of U.S. firms over the period of 1991-2009 and tries to mitigate possible omitted variables and endogeneity problems that are often overlooked in previous research. We demonstrate that firms with operational diversity programs are likely more dependent on a broad variety of resources and give more to community as a strategic maneuver; hence, operational diversity is a better indicator for predicting future corporate giving than board diversity alone. However, having a woman or a member of a minority as a company's chief executive officer is not sufficient to impact its charitable giving. A battery of robustness tests support our conclusion and confirm that our results are not driven by a firm's general corporate social responsibility (CSR) score, gender or independence of board members, or firm ownership. This paper will assist researchers, practitioners, and other stakeholders in deepening their understanding of the predictors of corporate giving. (c) 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

This study examined the association between corporate transparency and ethical orientation of Fortune 500 companies and the number of females represented on the board of directors from the Fortune (2010) annual report data. Our basis for this judgment was whether the firm was listed on either (both) Ethisphere Magazine's "2010 World's Most Ethical Companies" (Ethisphere Magazine 2011) or (and) Corporate Responsibility Magazine's "100 Best Corporate Citizens 2010" (Corporate Responsibility Magazine 2011) list(s). Our results indicated that, as the number of women directors increased, the probability of a corporation appearing on these lists increased. We also found that a ''critical mass'' of women directors was indicated by the data for Ethisphere Magazine's but not Corporate Responsibility Magazine's list.

This study draws from the corporate governance literature to investigate the implications of board involvement for international joint ventures (IJVs). We extend recent corporate governance research on the value of board involvement by investigating unique sources of complexity related to the nature of the IJV. We argue and find that board involvement can enhance the performance of IJVs, particularly for collaborations that are complex in nature due to their broad functional scope as well the level of market overlap between IJV parents. We complement recent research on joint venture control that has focused on the antecedents and types of control, as well as studies on formal (e.g. contractual safeguards and monitoring) and informal governance mechanisms (e.g. trust) by providing empirical evidence that IJV board involvement is valuable when directors undertake their control and coordination responsibilities. We advance corporate governance research by providing evidence that joint ventures possess several unique characteristics that shape the value of board involvement, thereby showing that applications of corporate governance theory to joint ventures are useful, but should be made with care.

In this paper we develop and test a theoretical model that reduces relational risks to solve the puzzle of conflicting task requirements imposed on boards of directors in listed companies. Doing so unites two seemingly conflicting tasks-board control and service tasks-through examining relational risks between the board and the CEO. We also present two mechanisms that could reduce relational risks. One is board power over the CEO, and the other board trust in the CEO. Practitioners could apply these two mechanisms to achieve better performance of board control and service tasks simultaneously. We test hypotheses using 441 survey responses collected in 2005. The result shows a good fit between the model and survey data, indicating examining relational risks is a rewarding approach to understanding conflicting board task performance, and board control over the CEO and board trust in the CEO are two effective mechanisms to reduce relational risks.

This paper reports on the interaction of compositional effects of boards of directors (BoD) and top management teams (TMTs) on firms' financial performance. Composition of both groups is investigated for cultural, age, tenure and gender diversity. We explore effects of demographic diversity in the two power groups on performance in interaction with each other by bringing in the similarity-attraction paradigm to argue for the relationship. Study data are from consolidated financial statements in annual reports of listed Swedish corporations. Our findings suggest that while differences in gender, age and tenure diversities have no effect on firm performance, close alignment of cultural diversities of the BoD and TMT does have a positive effect of firm performance.

This study focuses on the role of the corporate board of directors and the relationship between the dynamics of board structure and the financial performance of listed South African companies. The research results found that the proportion of independent non-executive directors had a significant positive effect on firm performance as measured by earnings per share and enterprise value, but had no significant effect on Tobin's Q ratio. Board ownership had a significant negative correlation with firm performance as measured by earnings per share, enterprise value and Tobin's Q ratio. The number of directors serving on the corporate board had a significant positive effect on firm performance as measured by earnings per share, enterprise value and Tobin's Q ratio. The study suggests that greater independent non-executive director representation, lower board share-ownership and larger board sizes should be encouraged to enhance firm performance.

Using a large sample analysis of Thai listed firms, we address an important question. Do board diversity and network add value to firms? This article extends the debate on the benefits and costs of board diversity and network and their effect on the broader picture of corporate governance. The sample period straddles 2001 to 2005, which allows us to examine board characteristics in response to the Asian financial crisis. We find that diversity in age and study majors are positively related to Tobin's Q ratio, while diversity in educational levels leads to lower firm value. Our results suggest that boards with diverse age groups and study areas might generate useful advice and complement each other; however, those with diverse educational levels might create costs due to possible conflicts and a lack of coordination and communication. In addition, the results show that alumni networks have a positive effect on Tobin's Q ratio. The findings further suggest that board networks could bring benefits to firms. An alumni network is significant to firms because it could help firms obtain external resources. It also provides significant findings for policy makers to design best practices of directors in emerging countries. (c) author(s) Creative Commons License CC-BY.

By integrating agency, stewardship and resource-dependency perspectives, this paper associated three characteristics of the board of directors - outside directors, insiders' equity ownership and leadership duality (Executive Officer also being the Chairman of the Board) - with bank's financial performance in Lebanon. Using a panel model, and after controlling for endogeneity problems, we examined 54 listed and unlisted banks from 2005 to 2010. Our results implied that the presence of outside directors on the board and the leadership duality have no statistical impact on performance. It seems that severe regulations by the Lebanese monetary authority act as an external governance mechanism. On the contrary, insiders' ownership promotes convergence of the interests of managers/shareholders and shapes the performance of banks. Our findings may well urge Lebanese bankers and regulators towards further development and implementation of governance practices to enhance the performance and the stability of one of the pillars of the Lebanese economy.

The purpose of this paper is to explore and verify roles of boards as bundle of tasks in the context of SMEs in a small country. This is a descriptive study based on the perceptions of CEOs. The objective was to find empirical evidence for what boards in small and medium sized companies perceive they do in terms of tasks and roles. A survey was sent out to 560 SMEs in Iceland and the response rate was 21%. Factor analysis shows that three different roles can be measured in SMEs: Monitoring role, Strategic role and Resource and Advice role. The results of this research show that boards in SMEs can and do have more than one role and are more active in strategy than often is assumed. (c) 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The interlocking board directorships among corporations. as well as between corporations and social organizations, is important for defining the modern political economy. This article finds the networks of those interlocks for Koch Industries Inc. and TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation. Moreover, the article extends the networks to describe and analyze the accompanying political network of contributions to Nebraska political campaigns. For corporate and social networks, we utilize conventional theoretical structures to find the new database of those networks for Koch Industries and TD Ameritrade. The new theoretical structure and database concern the campaign contributions of the board of directors in the corporate and social networks, as we trace them to campaigns for federal offices. The new political campaign finance structure we uncover here includes thousands of interconnected campaign finance conduits, through which money flows to political campaigns.

The recent systemic crisis that has affected the financial markets and real economies of major industrialized countries has had significant effects on the corporate governance and key organizational choices of large firms. In this context, the present study aims to verify whether the international crisis has significantly changed the structure of the interlocking directorate network that links large firms in the regulated Italian market. To this end, the first part of the paper presents an analysis of the evolution of corporate governance in the main European regulated markets through a comparative analysis of some synthetic statistical data observed at the end of the years 2006, 2008 and 2010. In the second part, after framing the concept of interlocking directorate in a theoretical perspective, we examine the evolution of the network of personal ties between large Italian listed companies in the period of observation (2006-2010) using Social Network Analysis.

The main purpose of this study is to develop and examine the theoretical model of hospital governance. For this purpose, this study integrates the literature of organizational governance and agency theory to empirically test the relationship between hospital governance mechanisms (structure of board of directors, information disclosure, and decision making) and hospital governance effectiveness (financial, customer, internal process, learning and growth, and social responsibility). This study empirically tested hospital governance related indices from 102 hospitals by using secondary data. The results find that (1) information disclosure and decision making of hospital governance mechanisms are positively related to its governance effectiveness, and (2) the relationship between the structures of board of directors and its governance effectiveness is non-significant. The theoretical and managerial implications and suggestions of future study are provided at the end of this study.

In this study, we investigated the impact of academicians as board members on firm outcomes. Based on popular theories of corporate governance, we contend that firms with academicians as directors would have more vigilance on their boards, would perform better based on accounting measures, and would be perceived as more valuable based on a market measure. Using a matched-pair design, our results showed that firms with academician directors do not have more vigilance on their boards and do not differ based on their accounting performance. However, they are perceived to be more valuable, which signifies the possible positive impact of academicians on one of the organizational outcomes. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. (c) The Authors 2013.

The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between board composition and financial vulnerability of non-profit organizations in Malaysia. Information on these variables is obtained from the content analysis of annual reports of 205 societies registered with Registrar of Societies in Malaysia for the financial period 2010. Results of this study revealed significant relationships between some board compositions and some measures of financial vulnerabilities. First, there is a significant positive relationship between board members with professional affiliations and solvency. Second, there is a negative relationship between board members with political connections and efficiency as well as solvency. These findings indicate that types of directors on the board are important as they bring specific critical resources to match the specific environmental needs facing the organizations. In addition, the findings also provide useful information that can facilitate screening, monitoring, and decision making processes for various stakeholders.

Marta Cuadrado This study advances research on CEO succession and board monitoring of senior executives by examining how proprietary directors can affect the probability of CEO dismissal. Drawing on our newly developed database covering all CEO successions occurring in all Spanish listed firms during the period 2007-2010, we propose that proprietary directors may increase the board's monitoring efforts over the chief executive, forcing him to resign in situations of poor performance. Hypotheses are tested longitudinally, using CEO succession data taken from 111 publicly-traded firms in the Spanish mercado continuo' over a four-year period.

We investigate the effect of corporate sustainability on organizational processes and performance. Using a matched sample of 180 U.S. companies, we find that corporations that voluntarily adopted sustainability policies by 1993 - termed as high sustainability companies - exhibit by 2009 distinct organizational processes compared to a matched sample of companies that adopted almost none of these policies - termed as low sustainability companies. The boards of directors of high sustainability companies are more likely to be formally responsible for sustainability, and top executive compensation incentives are more likely to be a function of sustainability metrics. High sustainability companies are more likely to have established processes for stakeholder engagement, to be more long-term oriented, and to exhibit higher measurement and disclosure of nonfinancial information. Finally, high sustainability companies significantly outperform their counterparts over the long term, both in terms of stock market and accounting performance. (c) 2014 INFORMS.

Diverse boards have been seen as providing impetus for initiating change. However, diversity may introduce conflict and impede decision making, which could hinder the ability of the firm to make strategic change, especially in times when firm performance is low. Integrating threat-rigidity theory and team diversity research, we examine how board gender diversity, firm performance, and the power of women directors interact to influence the amount of strategic change. Results support a three-way interaction, indicating that when the board is not experiencing a threat as a result of low firm performance and women directors have greater power, the relationship between board gender diversity and amount of strategic change is the most positive. However, when the board is threatened by low firm performance and women directors have greater power, the relationship between board gender diversity and amount of strategic change is the most negative. Results suggest that diversity is double-edged because it can propel or impede strategic change depending on firm performance and the power of women directors.

Divergent views exist about whether boards must tradeoff advising for monitoring performance when utilizing outside versus inside directors. We suggest a dichotomous tradeoff focus underestimates outside directors[U+05F3] impact on board performance. We find outside director tenure positively associated with firm acquisition/investment policy advising performance and CEO compensation monitoring performance, suggesting that advising and monitoring do not always compete for directors[U+05F3] time. However, tenure is not a panacea - it marginally weakens financial reporting monitoring performance which is instead enhanced by outside directors[U+05F3] financial expertise. Overall, the results suggest outside director tenure and diverse expertise support both advising and monitoring performance. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Building on corporate governance research and institutional theory, this paper explores interrelationships between the firm's corporate governance, responsible leadership, and corporate social responsibility approaches in different institutional contexts. We present a critique of corporate governance research grounded in agency theory with its focus on corporate social responsibility as mere compliance with rules and regulations. We link different leadership orientations and corporate social responsibility approaches to two key process dimensions of corporate governance related to monitoring and incentives. This analysis builds on previous research that differentiates between governance mechanisms based on strategic as opposed to financial controls and explains how these types of control may be related to responsible managerial behavior and the firm's corporate social responsibility strategies. Building on governance studies grounded in sociology and organizational theory, we further argue that links between corporate social responsibility strategies and corporate governance factors such as boards of directors, ownership patterns, and executive incentives may differ depending on the legal system and institutional characteristics in a specific country. Our discussion suggests that researchers need to develop a more holistic, institutionally embedded governance framework to analyze organizational approaches to corporate social responsibility.

Research on human capital as a source of competitive advantage has focused largely on firm employees. In this article, we argue that outside directors' general human capital can also be a source of competitive advantage. Firm performance is likely to benefit from directors' human capital-that is, their prior experience and education-because such human capital is likely to make them more effective at monitoring management and providing advice. Drawing on insights from research on individuals' cognitive limitations, we further argue that the extent to which the firm is able to benefit from this human capital can be severely limited by the demands for information processing that directors face from their other board positions. Consequently, we find that the benefit of directors' human capital is contingent upon the information processing load placed upon them from their other board appointments. We find support for our hypotheses using data on over 5,700 directors from 650 firms sampled from the Fortune 1000. This study extends the nascent literature on board human capital by showing that in addition to specific expertise in relevant areas, directors' general human capital can also help firms create competitive advantage. The theory developed in this article also contributes to the literature on strategic human capital by incorporating the concept of information processing demands, suggesting that not only do such demands leave limited cognitive capacity for directors to focus on the focal firm but also that they can severely diminish the beneficial effects of directors' general human capital.

This paper contributes to the corporate governance literature by developing and testing theory regarding positive and negative synergies between the CEO's and the board's human and social capital. Using a sample of 360 biotechnology firms that went public between 1995 and 2010, we demonstrate that accumulated public company board experiences of the CEO and the board have positive synergistic effects on IPO performance whereas the current board appointments have negative effects. While scientific educational backgrounds have positive synergies, industry-specific experiences produce either positive or counterproductive effects depending on the age and profitability of the firm. Thus, our paper contributes to the corporate governance and human and social capital literatures by describing the costs and benefits of specific types and combinations of CEO and board capital.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Questions/Issues: We explore why and how the different combinations of governance practices at national level, such as the legal system, conduct codes, and capital markets, and at firm level, such as various types of controlling shareholders, enable or constrain outside directors to engage in their monitoring and resource provision roles. Building upon such analysis, we develop a new taxonomy of corporate governance systems according to the different configurations of a set of interdependent governance characteristics, including national governance mechanisms, identity of block shareholders, and functions of outside directors. Research Insights: This study enriches the growing body of research on governance complementarity and substitution by highlighting the role of bundles of governance practices in influencing directors' engagement in governance behavior, and consequently advancing our understanding of variation in corporate governance systems across and within countries. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This paper demonstrates that the roles of outside directors depend on the interaction between a bundle of governance mechanisms rather than any individual mechanisms. The paper also goes beyond the traditional governance models based on the national context and highlights that interdependencies of corporate governance practices play an important role in explaining the diversity and variation of corporate governance arrangements across firms in both industrialized economies and emerging markets. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This paper provides insights to policymakers by suggesting that not all the governance bundles are conducive to managerial monitoring and resource provision by outside directors.

This paper develops relational pluralism as a collective construct whose dimensions are heterogeneity, multiplexity, and asymmetry. Relational pluralism is instantiated in the board of directors, whose network of relationships influence a new venture's ability to establish external links beyond the networks of the founding team. We argue that relational pluralism speeds the establishment of a diverse alliance portfolio, which, in turn, speeds the attainment of major revenue milestones in a new firm. We examine these ideas in a population of de novo semiconductor firms and find that diverse alliance portfolios emerge faster when a board includes members with heterogeneous, multiplex relationships, as well as central network positions. However, the asymmetric influence of outside board members can have both positive and negative effects: the alliance formation process is aided by outsiders in central network positions, but impeded when central investors dominate the board. We discuss implications for our understanding of relational pluralism as a collective construct. (c) Academy of Management Journal.

In this paper, it is argued that boards internationalize by recruiting international directors in order to increase companies' performance. However, increasing nationality diversity on a board can be costly considering that it potentially creates cooperative problems on a board due to fault-lines and separation processes. As a result, boards will prefer international candidates who are more similar to themselves on a variety of 'distances'. Based on data collected regarding 5683 board members of 361 companies from 15 countries in 2005-2007, we discover that the greater the distance (cultural, institutional and geographical) between the candidates' and the companies' country-of-origin, the lower the fraction of board members of that nationality on boards. Subsequently, it is argued that historical ties between countries play a 'distance compressing' role and partially compensate for the effects of distance. A colonial tie between countries will make recruitment of these particular nationalities more likely than others. (c) 2013.

Our research aims at exploring individual's characteristics of women on Boards in the French context. In the first part of our paper, we discuss the different theoretical frameworks which supported the business case of gender diversity on Boards of Directors and expose our hypothesis regarding differences in women and men characteristics. The second part presents our methods, measurements and data. Then, we focus on our empirical study. Our sample consists of the French Index SBF 120 companies. We studied the profile of 1,250 directors collecting information from the firms' annual reports of year 2010, using various scales defined by previous research on that field in the Anglo-Saxon literature. Our findings confirm that integrating women on boards has an impact on the Human and Social Capital of Boards but not as much as might have been expected. It is worth noting that men and women board members seem to build their human and social capital through the same educational process in France. Nonetheless, our work shows significant differences between men and women regarding professional experience and board member status. (c) by author(s); CC-BY.

Purpose: This study aims to open up the black box of the boardroom by directly observing directors' interactions during meetings to better understand board processes.
Design/methodology/approach: We analyze videotaped observations of board meetings at two Australian companies to develop insights into what directors do in meetings and how they participate in decision-making processes. The direct observations are triangulated with semi-structured interviews, mini-surveys and document reviews.
Findings: Our analyses lead to two key fndings: while board meetings appear similar at a surface level, boardroom interactions vary significantly at a deeper level (i.e. board members participate differently during different stages of discussions), and factors at multiple levels of analysis explain differences in interaction patterns, revealing the complex and nested nature of boardroom discussions.
Research implications: Bydocumenting significant intra- and inter-board meeting differences, our study challenges the widespread notion of board meetings as rather homogeneous and monolithic, points towards agenda items as a new unit of analysis and highlights the need for more multi-level analyses in a board setting.
Practical implications: While policymakers have been largely occupied with the "right" board composition, our findings suggest that decision outcomes or roles' execution could be potentially affected by interactions at a board level. Differences in board meeting styles might explain prior ambiguous board structure-performance results, enhancing the need for greater normative consideration of how boards do their work.
Originality/value: This study complements existing research on boardroom dynamics and provides a systematic account of director interactions during board meetings. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Integrating risk, gender diversity and upper echelons literatures, we examine whether the presence of women in upper management (top management team (TMT) and board of directors (BOD)) and the tenure of TMTs and BODs are associated with the risk of lawsuits. An analysis of data from firms in the US retail industry shows that the presence of women in TMTs and BODs and the tenure of TMTs and BODs are negatively associated with legal risk, but longer tenured BODs with more women had a positive impact on lawsuits. Implications and suggestions for future research are offered. (c) 2012 British Academy of Management.

Chief information officers (CIOs) play increasingly strategic roles in firms in this competitive global economy, which is now largely powered by information technology (IT). However, research has shown a lack of board of directors' oversight on CIO- and IT-related issues. Drawing on agency, resource dependence, and alignment theories, we investigate the effect of board of directors' IT awareness on CIO compensation structure and firm performance. We conduct cross-sectional time series analyses of data collected from various sources. Our study underlines three important findings. First, we show that some commonly known executive compensation determinants, such as individual characteristics and governance structure, do not have significant effects on CIO compensation structure. Second, with regard to CIO compensation structure, firms respond to increasing information asymmetry differently according to the level of IT awareness of their boards. Finally, firms perform better when their boards have higher levels of IT awareness, and this positive effect of IT awareness is considerably larger in IT intensive industries. Overall, our study provides empirical support for the important role of boards' IT awareness in shaping CIO compensation and improving firm performance. Our results suggest that boards with functional area knowledge-or higher IT awareness in this case-can more effectively monitor and better incentivize executives, and consequently lead to better firm performance.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines whether certain proxies for board incentives and board capital are linked with bankruptcy in unlisted firms. Research Findings/Insights: Based on data analyzed over a five-year period with a sample of 232 matched pairs of unlisted firms, results reveal that firms with boards led by an independent Board Chair (vs. CEO duality), and including longer-tenured directors, and directors with fewer additional directorships on average, are less likely to become bankrupt. Results of analyses of board size and board change support a "reputation" hypothesis, i.e. that directors begin to flee firms in a downward spiral prior to bankruptcy. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Results support an eclectic model of board incentives and board capital, which integrates elements of agency and resource dependence theories, and the group decision-making literature to explain governance antecedents of firms that went bankrupt. It builds on a model proposed by Hillman and Dalziel, while identifying important differences, including lack of support for predicted moderating effects between board incentives and board capital. Findings also support applicability of the threat-rigidity logic and reputation hypothesis in this context, and the importance of anchoring corporate governance research more precisely on prediction of certain levels of performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Findings support governance recommendations to separate Board Chair and CEO leadership and limit a director's number of outside directorships. Negative effects of director tenure on bankruptcy contradict the notion of "term limits," suggesting that benefits of firm-specific knowledge and experience may outweigh risks of entrenchment.

Research on the composition of the board of directors of DMOs as well as the governance of DMOs is of particular interest for destination management, because it helps understand the context of community-type tourist destinations. There is an increasing body of research on the composition and roles of DMO boards of directors as well as the duties and tasks of those individuals. However, to date, no study has addressed their influence on the financial revenues of the organization. A DMO's budget is not God-given but evolves along with the development of the organizations and the institutions in the destinations. Thus, we investigate to what extent directors on the boards affect the amount from different revenue sources. Using data from 44 Swiss local and regional DMOs, we perform seven distinct multiple regressions with the following revenue sources as dependent variables: (1) membership fees, (2) partnership platforms/initiatives, (3) commercial revenues, (4) overnight taxes, (5) regional and state subsidies, (6) municipal subsidies, and (7) tourism taxes. Four independent variables (1) stakeholders, (2) public agents, (3) leaders, and (4) networkers, positively and negatively affect the revenue sources. The results reveal two contrasting roles: while leaders and networkers likely increase the revenue sources, stakeholder representatives and public agents negatively affect the revenue sources. Additionally, the latter two functions strongly increase the size of the DMOs' boards. We conclude with a new perspective on how to understand DMO boards, their functions, and finally the organizations themselves. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This empirical study challenges the theory that a 'critical mass' of three or more women at the boardroom table is needed to make a difference. Performance ratings of Canadian publicly traded companies by the Globe and Mail show consistently higher corporate governance scores for companies with more women on their boards of directors. However, while companies that had three or more women on their boards had the highest scores, companies with only one woman on the board scored significantly higher than those with none. There was also no relationship between the number of women on boards of directors and Corporate Knights' social responsibility ratings on a national or global basis. The size of board and the type of industry are other important factors to consider when proposing quotas for female board members. (c) 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

In this article, we conduct a longitudinal study of women's progress on French corporate boards of directors. We particularly focus on the extent to which women directors have circumvented the glass ceiling. Using a sample of SBF 120 companies over a 10-year period from 2000 to 2009, our results provide evidence of a significant increase in the number of women on French corporate boards. However, the corporate glass ceiling hypothesis is consistently rejected whatever the considered measure of female directors; i.e., the number of board seats held by women, the number of firms with a critical mass of female directors, and the number of directorships held by each women director.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the nature of corporate governance practised by co-operatives and mutual societies in New Zealand and whether there is any relationship between co-operatives' ownership structure, capital structure and agency costs. The study also explores whether the capital structure and the ownership structure changed during the period 2005-2011. Design/methodology/approach - Panel data for the period 2005-2011 are analysed using ordinary least squares regression and the Tobit model regression. The authors have used operating expense to sales, asset utilisation and ROA as the dependent variables. Findings - The findings indicate that an increase in independent directors, board member experience and size (measured by total annual sales) reduces agency costs in co-operatives and mutuals in New Zealand. Also, borrowing from members rather than banks reduces agency cost and increases profitability in co-operatives and mutuals. Research limitations/implications - Caution should be exercised when generalising the findings of the study as it is restricted to New Zealand environment and the sample size used is relatively small. Practical implications - This study offers insights for policy makers internationally who are interested in adopting similar corporate governance practices in their own countries. Within New Zealand, the corporate governance debate associated with co-operatives and mutual societies will be better informed as a direct consequence of this research. Originality/value - This is the first study that extends the research undertaken by Ang et al. (2000) and Singh and Davidson (2003) to the cooperative and mutual business model in New Zealand.

An initial public offering (IPO) represents one of the final stages in the life of a small firm as it transitions from private to public. In this paper the experience of directors is examined to determine the extent of the role they play in ensuring a successful listing. Unique data from 122 IPOs on the Swedish Stock Exchange have been examined in a search for the effect of director experience on aftermarket performance. Specific aspects of director experience within a board, such as interlocking directorships and average tenure, are connected to the underpricing of Swedish IPOs. Contrary to expectations, no statistically significant relationship was found between long-run aftermarket performance and director experience at the time of an IPO. This suggests that the previous experience of directors, as measured in earlier studies, is less relevant to long-term aftermarket performance in Sweden compared to other countries studied in the literature review. This emphasises the importance of examining different institutional contexts. (c)2014 Australasian Accounting Business and Finance Journal and Authors.

Purpose - With boards of directors playing both monitoring and guidance roles, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of board structure on firm value in large US and UK firms using the lenses of agency and resource dependence theories. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of firms in the USA and the UK from 2000 to 2007, the paper conducts a panel data analysis of the impact of board structure on firm value and examine the nuances of different governance environments. Findings - The paper finds distinct differences in the impact of board independence, board size, and outside director busyness on firm value between UK and US firms. Specifically, the paper finds that board independence, board size, and board busyness all have a significant positive impact on firm value in the UK. However, the paper finds no significant relationship between board independence and firm value among US firms. Both board size and board busyness are found to be positively associated with firm value in the USA. Social implications - The paper finds strong support for resource dependence theory in the UK but limited support for agency theory in the USA. Originality/value - This paper takes a multi-country approach to examining the impact of board structure on firm value. (c) 2014, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - This paper aims to understand the determinants of board structure of listed firms at institutional, industry and firm levels within an emerging economy. At the institutional level, the paper explores laws, managerial culture and the role of state in instituting and endorsing corporate governance practices. At the firm level, ownership patterns (family and non-family), experience in the capital markets, age and size of the firms are studied to find out the relation between these variables and the board structure. Design/methodology/approach - The research domain of the study is listed firms operating on the Istanbul Stock Exchange. The data for the study are collected at two phases; at the first phase, compliance reports, annual reports, articles of association and annual shareholders' meeting reports of each firm in the sample are analyzed. At the second stage, secondary data are used for understanding the dynamics of Turkish institutional context. Findings - The results of this study reveal that boards of directors of listed Turkish firms comply with the governance practices instituted by state agencies, except on issues as independent members and committees that will influence the majority owners' control domain and private benefits. Originality/value - This paper draws attention on institutional context and argues that "good governance" instruments developed for Anglo-Saxon stock market-controlled business systems provide limited explanation for an emerging economy that is characterized by close cooperation between the state, family-owned businesses and financial markets. The study offers insight to policy makers at a national level, interested in developing corporate governance principles regarding boards of directors of listed firms.

We examine the contingencies that sway independent noncore directors of S&P 500 firms to heed the norms of the corporate elite or the disciplining forces of the efficient directorial labor market in the context of executive entrenchment. We find support for the corporate elite perspective as the number of independent noncore directors is positively associated with an entrenchment index score. However, the positive association is moderated by contextual factors that influence whether these directors reflect the expectations of the corporate elite or the efficient directorial labor market. Specifically, this study shows that the association becomes more positive when these directors are highly embedded in the corporate elite network or have shorter board tenure but less positive when independent chief executive officer directors' equity ownership is high. We also found a crossover interaction effect where the association is negative (positive) when firm performance is low (high). These results shed light on an underexplored group of independent directors that play an increasing role in the effective governance of publicly listed firms. (c) 2014 INFORMS.

Purpose: This paper aims to focus on governance theories and practice variables in Not-For-Profit Service Organizations. The research answers two questions: what the prevalent governance practices of Not-for-Profit Service Organizations (NPSO) are, and whether there is a crossover among NPSO governance practices and For-Profit-Organization theories in the literature. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire to the 285 organizations within the defined parameters obtained a 18 percent response. Data were collected regarding the boards' predominant roles in the organizations' governance activities, the top executives' predominant roles in the organizations' operations and their interrelationship with the boards, and the boards' most common meeting agenda topics. Findings: The findings prove that governance models in NPSO are mostly driven by Agency Theory (52 percent of the sample). Stewardship and Resource Dependence Theories also contribute to existing governance models (28 percent), while some of the organizations have developed Hybrid Models (20 percent) drawing from the various theories. Research limitations/implications: The limited number of organizations participating in the research does not allow a generalization. However the diversity of organization types and sizes within the scope do provide a panoramic view of the not-for-profit service sector. Practical implications: Having proved that there is a crossover of governance practices among For-Profit and Not-for Profit Organizations, this research opens the door to the evaluation of many other existing or potential crossovers in governance and other management elements. Originality/value: This research is novel in its approach to look for similarities rather than differences between For-Profit and Not-for-Profit Organizations. The approach allows both sectors to learn from each other and seek for fresh improvement alternatives. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study aims to examine the relationship between multiple directorships and the monitoring role of the board of directors in Malaysian listed companies (PLC). The monitoring role is proxied by the percentage of directors' attendance in board meetings, as attending meetings provides directors with resources about the management actions and assists directors to exercise their role effectively. The study uses a sample of 1023 directors from 134 companies on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia (Malaysian Bourse) in year 2008. The results of the study show that the incidence of multiple directorships is low. Independent directors are found to have more multiple directorships. Directors with multiple directorships are older directors, have less director ownerships and are on boards with a high fraction of independent directors. Based on the 75% cut-off for the percentage of meetings' attendance, the logistic regression suggests that no agency cost is associated with multiple directorships. However, the tendency to be absent from board meetings is associated with the high number of board meetings whilst the tendency to attend more board meetings is associated with the increase in age, tenure, and director ownership.

Purpose - This study aims to investigate the nature and extent of compliance to the principle-based corporate governance initiatives by the listed companies in the South Pacific Stock Exchange (SPSE) in Fiji. Three important questions are addressed: whether listed companies in Fiji have complied with the principle-based governance practices? Did compliance with principle-based recommendations lead to an improvement in the listed company's financial performance and legitimacy? How the institutional factors have contributed towards corporate governance practices in Fiji? Design/methodology/approach - Panel data for the SPSE companies over the period 2008-2011 are analysed using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. Tobin's Q and return on assets (ROA) metrics are used as dependent variables. Findings - The findings indicate that listed companies have adopted the Capital Market Development Authority's (CMDA) recommendations by establishing subcommittees for audit and remuneration, having non-executive/independent directors on the board and separate chair and CEO positions in order to gain legitimacy from stakeholders. Results support the view that the CMDA recommendations of board sub-committees (audit and remuneration) have had positive influence on company performance measured by Tobin's Q. The findings of this study give support to the principle-based corporate governance practices adopted in Fiji to gain legitimacy. Originality/value - The study adds to the governance literature by focusing on the principle-based governance practices in a small remote island country, Fiji which has relatively small economy, capital market and company size. Finally, the study adds to institutional theory by showing how companies' corporate governance choices are affected by the severity of agency conflicts and the way corporate governance is regulated.

This study explores how new ventures access advice to achieve high growth and sustainable performance. A relational model of three important themes - compliance (regulatory and legal governance), contacts (networks of suppliers, customers, investors), and content (strategic insights) - emerged as critical to any sustainable high-growth effort. Our findings suggest that advisory boards and boards of directors have a significant role in managing and creating value for emerging high-growth firms due to inherently high failure rates, technological complexity, and market risk - all of which requires access to external resources.

Research Question/Issue: When the stock options granted to CEOs go underwater, boards of directors tend to award additional stock options to their CEOs. Drawing on agency theory and attribution theory, this study explores social psychological mechanisms that explain why boards of directors increase new option grants to CEOs in response to underwater options. Research Findings/Insights: Using the compensation data of CEOs at 966 US firms, we found that contextual factors such as market conditions and industry performance affected boards of directors' decisions to grant new stock options. Consistent with our hypotheses, boards of directors granted a greater number of new options to CEOs in response to CEOs' underwater options during the recession period than the recovery period, and they granted fewer new options when the firm's industry performance was high rather than low. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study incorporates attribution theory in understanding boards of directors' causal attribution of firm performance and its impact on executive compensation. It complements earlier studies on causal attribution by exploring the role of contextual factors. It also contributes to the research by examining the attribution process of boards of directors rather than that of top management, as well as the consequences of the causal attribution in terms of ex-post adjustment in executive option compensation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study provides up-to-date and improved evidence on boards' decision making about executive stock options. Practitioners and policy makers can benefit from the study's findings that board members rely on contextual information about the market and the competition when they make causal attribution of firm performance changes, which tends to affect their decisions about executive compensation.

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to survey chairmens perceptions of female board representation in five Nordic countries, focussing on whether the chairmans perception of board work is related to gender diversity, and on differences between high- and low-risk firms. Design/methodology/approach The authors combine data from a questionnaire directed to the chairmen of the boards in Nordic listed companieswith data on firmcharacteristics and board composition. Findings The authors find that the chairmen (97.5 percent male) are significantly less satisfied with female board members as compared to male ones. The authors also find that firms with nomination committees have more gender diverse boards, as well as indications of a more positively perceived contribution of female representation in high-risk firms. Research limitations/implications The study is restricted to perceptions of chairmen for listed Nordic firms. The low response rate of 20.1 percent is a severe limitation. Practical implications The increasing practice of using nomination committees in the Nordic countries seems advantageous from gender balance perspective. Originality/value The authors contribute to the literature on gender diversity in boards by providing results from a board intern perspective. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study investigates the effect of outside director experience on the performance of a firm's joint venture (JV) engagements, a type of strategic move where the influence of board remains under-investigated despite directors' active participation in the decision-making process. By examining the direct linkage between director experience and strategic performance, our research presents the first direct evidence of the value outside director experience has for a firm's strategic engagements; this has previously been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. We address this important issue in the following three ways. First, we explore what type of director experience contributes most to JV outcomes. Second, we investigate what circumstantial factors significantly influence the value of director experience. Lastly, we analyze whether incentive mechanisms moderate the relationship between director experience and firm performance. The results confirm the value of director experience gained from JV engagements but not from relevant industries. In addition, executive experience and the industry affiliation of the JV significantly moderate the value of director experience. Finally, experienced directors with large shareholdings outperform those with experience but limited stakes in the firms' equity, justifying the necessity to motivate directors' governance efforts despite their existing fiduciary obligation to shareholders. Our study contributes to agency theory by indicating that director experience holds a significant influence on a firm's strategic performance, an issue which has long been neglected in agency-based governance research. It also contributes to resource-dependence theory by providing a direct measurement of directors' experiential assets, which have so far been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. Finally, findings from this study can elucidate the long-standing question of how a firm can realize the purported benefits JVs provide by introducing a vital yet rarely explored factor: board experience.

In this study, we investigated the possible moderating effects of environmental dynamism, environmental complexity, and environmental munificence on the relationships between changes in top management teams and board of directors and firm performance in the case of young entrepreneurial firms. The results showed that the three dimensions of environment do not moderate the relationship between the rate of change in top management teams and firm performance. On the other hand, the negative relationship between the rate of change in board of directors and firm performance is exacerbated by environmental complexity and munificence. The implications of these findings are discussed in the article. (c) The Authors 2014.

Drawing together literature on corporate governance, organizational behavior, and educational psychology, and using survey data from a sample of 300 Chinese company directors, this study examines the mediating role of director learning goal orientation in linking two widely-acknowledged director social identifications (identification with the organization and identification with executive-agents) and a key director task behavior, namely the monitoring of executive-agents. We also investigate the moderating role of director avoidance orientation in influencing this mediation since a predisposition to avoid loss of "face" is widely posited as having particular relevance in the Chinese context. Results show, first, that directors with stronger organizational identification monitor executive-agents more diligently than those with stronger executive-agent identification. Second, we find that while learning goal orientation mediates the positive effects of both organizational identification and executive-agent identification on monitoring, the mediated indirect effect of organizational identification on monitoring is stronger than the mediated indirect effect of executive-agent identification on monitoring. Third, results show that the indirect effects are stronger when director avoidance orientation is low. These findings underscore the importance of director social identification and learning goal orientation in inducing director monitoring in the Chinese context, as well as the worth of selecting directors who exhibit a low disposition to avoidance.

The debate around corporate governance has been particularly vigorous in this part of the 21st century. Theoretical frameworks have been tested by spectacular corporate failures that also raise questions as to the effectiveness of different approaches. Empirical, contextually-based research into how governance theory informs practice assists in understanding these questions. This paper explores findings from empirical research conducted into the make-up of boards of directors in New Zealand, an export focused economy dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises. These findings are revealing in demonstrating that despite the challenges faced by the New Zealand industry in a volatile global environment, the skill-sets and other characteristics present in, and sought from, directors appear to be both narrow and traditional. However, there is also evidence to suggest shifting expectations and requirements are to some extent and will continue to propel change in both boards and in contributions expected of individual directors.

This chapter considers the institutional environment in Russia, its potential impact upon governance practices, and the attitudes of Russian executives towards the alignment of governance processes relative to international standards. Focusing on corporate board directorship, the research addresses the extent that the harmonization of governance to international standards may assist boards of directors to improve their corporate development. Using a survey questionnaire, the authors explore perceptions of directors of public companies concerning the challenges of corporate governance development in the country. The study illustrates unanimity among the respondents about the reforms needed for international convergence of corporate governance standards. The results reveal that institutional alignment with good governance principles will foster strategic corporate development in the Russian economy. The study offers insights to policymakers in terms of enhancing legitimacy of corporate governance in the Russian context and provides a perspective for executives of foreign companies considering investment in the country.

This study investigates the valuation effect of board characteristics in corporate Joint Venture (JV) investments. Despite the prevalence of a board's involvement in JV decisions in practice, extant literature is mute concerning how the board adds value to JV outcomes. Investigation into board contribution in JVs is insightful due to executives' self-serving behaviors that may underlie their JV pursuits and boards' resource provision that may mitigate critical JV challenges. The former (latter) sheds light on the board's monitoring (advisory) role in a firm's JV engagement. Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, this study investigates the value of representative board characteristics underscored by these two theoretical perspectives. Our results show that the two conventional board measures, board size and outside director ratio, do not have a significant explanatory power. In contrast, director experience associated with JV decisions and gained from within relevant industries are found to positively impact JV outcomes. Moreover, both board meeting frequency and director ownership have favorable moderating effects on the strength of the experience-value relationship. However, these two variables per se do not independently determine a JV's value. Our research results indicate the importance of taking an integrative view to the investigation of board effectiveness, a perspective which has long been neglected in board research. The findings of the present study contribute to the mixed findings of extant studies on board influence from an uninvestigated domain, JV. (c), 2014, College of Management Press. All right reserved.

This study investigates the relationship between two governance issues, i.e., ownership and board structure of Malaysian listed firms (between 2010 and 2012) and their performance in terms of profitability, liquidity and gearing. Structural Equation Modeling is applied and the data analysis tool used is Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The dependent variables used as proxies for financial performance are; profitability, liquidity and gearing, whilst the independent variables are; ownership retention (OR), board size (BS), percentage of executive directors (ED), percentage of independent directors (ID) and percentage of non-independent non-executive directors (NINED). It is conjectured that there is consistency across all components of ownership and board structure in terms of its relationship with the gearing of companies. With the exception of non-independent non-executive directors, all other components of board structure in this study seem to have an impact on the gearing of companies. In that respect, it can be concluded that a company's ownership structure and board of directors who represent the shareholders have major concerns on the gearing of companies compared to other financial indicators, as the level of gearing of a company has important and long-lasting effects on the profitability and liquidity of companies. This study leads the path for further research on all aspects of a company's gearing. (c) the author(s).

The purpose of this study is to identify the relationship between the characteristics of the board of directors and strategic change of a firm in the Chinese context. In this study, strategic change is defined as strategic deviation relative to industry norms and strategic variation relative to historical experiences. The size, independence and leadership structure of the board of directors are defined as the board characteristics. We then propose hypotheses on the effects of board characteristics on a firm's strategic change. This study takes strategic resource allocation profile as measure to calculate strategic deviation and strategic variation, and then empirically tests and verifies the hypotheses using data from Chinese publicly listed companies in the information technology industry from the year 2006 to 2010. We find that the size, independence and leadership structure of the board of directors significantly affect both strategic deviation and strategic variation. Therefore, we conclude that board characteristic affects a firm's strategic change. The conclusion of the study indicates that moderate reductions in the size of the board, increasing the proportion of independent directors and separating the roles of chairman and chief executive officer can facilitate promoting the process of strategic change for a firm in a dynamic environment. Through this study we re-examine the role and significance of the board of directors in strategic decision-making for a firm, and provide useful suggestions on how to form a board that can meet the needs for strategic change for a firm in a dynamic business environment.

We formulate theory on the effect of board of director gender diversity on the broad spectrum of securities fraud, and generate three key insights. First, based on ethicality, risk aversion, and diversity, we hypothesize that gender diversity on boards can operate as a significant moderator for the frequency of fraud. Second, we advance that the stock market response to fraud from a more gender-diverse board is significantly less pronounced. Third, we posit that women are more effective in male-dominated industries in reducing both the frequency and severity of fraud. Results of our novel empirical tests, based on data from a large sample of Chinese firms that committed securities fraud, are largely consistent with each of these hypotheses.

Ten countries have established quotas for female representation on publicly traded corporate and/or state-owned enterprise boards of directors, ranging from 33 to 50 %, with various sanctions. Fifteen other countries have introduced non-binding gender quotas in their corporate governance codes enforcing a "comply or explain" principle. Countless other countries' leaders and policy groups are in the process of debating, developing, and approving legislation around gender quotas in boards. Taken together, gender quota legislation significantly impacts the composition of boards of directors and thus the strategic direction of these publicly traded and state-owned enterprises. This article outlines an integrated model of three institutional factors that explain the establishment of board of directors gender quota legislation based on the premise that the country's institutional environment co-evolves with gender corporate policies. We argue that these three key institutional factors are female labor market and gendered welfare state provisions, left-leaning political government coalitions, and path-dependent policy initiatives for gender equality, both in the public realm as well as in the corporate domain. We discuss implications of our conceptual model and empirical findings for theory, practice, policy, and future research. These include the adoption and penalty design of board diversity practices into corporate practices, bottom-up approaches from firm to country-level gender board initiatives, hard versus soft regulation, the leading role of Norway and its isomorphic effects, the likelihood of engaging in decoupling, the role of business leaders, and the transnational and international reaction to board diversity initiatives.

Corporate governance (CG) research has largely focused on internal governance mechanisms (i.e. the board of directors, controlling owners, and managerial incentives). However, much of this work ignores the role that external CG practices play in preventing managers from engaging in activities detrimental to the welfare of shareholders, and the overall firm. In this essay, we first review and organize current research on external governance mechanisms and integrate this siloed body of work within the broader CG equation. We explicitly focus on six external governance mechanisms: the legal environment, the market for corporate control, external auditors, stakeholder activism, rating organizations, and the media. We discuss findings showing how external governance mechanisms act both as independent forces and in conjunction with internal CG mechanisms. We conclude the review by mapping an agenda for future research on CG that better integrates internal and external governance mechanisms. Our review suggests that studying different configurations of external and internal governance mechanisms will help us to better understand what factors and conditions lead to effective CG.

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is increasingly becoming a strategic issue that has to be dealt with by top management. The aim of the present study is to analyse the role that women directors can play as driving forces behind the development of CSR in organisations, and contribute to sustainable development. Despite the fact that gender diversity is acquiring considerable importance, most research has focused on analysing how it affects financial performance. In this study, we analyse the implications that gender diversity has on CSR. To do so, we have carried out an empirical study of a sample of firms from a variety of countries and sectors to determine whether those firms with a higher percentage of women on the board of directors are more socially responsible. The results support the hypothesis that gender diversity has a positive influence on CSR. Female talent can play a strategic role in enabling firms to manage their social responsibility and sustainable practices appropriately. (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

Utilising a sample of Asian firms from Hong Kong, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore, this study shows that increasing numbers of female directors on the board have a positive effect on firm performance, as measured by return on equity (ROE). However, the positive effects of gender diversity appear to be diminished in countries with higher female economic participation and empowerment. This may be due to tokenism and suggests that forcing female director appointment or mandating gender quotas can reduce firm performance in countries with strong cultural resistance.

A growing body of work suggests that the presence of women and of independent directors on boards of directors is associated with higher corporate environmental performance. However, the mechanisms linking board composition to corporate environmental performance are not well understood. This study proposes and empirically tests the mediating role of sustainability-themed alliances in the relationship between board composition and corporate environmental performance. Using the population of public oil and gas firms in the United States as the sample, the study relies on renewable energy alliances to measure sustainability-themed alliances and longitudinally analyzes lagged data for independent and control variables. The study found that (1) the higher the representation of women on a firm's board, the more likely the firm is to form sustainability-themed alliances, and (2) the higher the representation of independent directors on a firm's board, the more likely the firm is to form sustainability-themed alliances. Such alliances, in turn, positively contribute to corporate environmental performance. This paper discusses the study's contributions to the board composition-social performance literature.

We distinguish between "family companies," involving multiple family members as owners and/or managers, and "lone-founder companies," involving only the founder and no other family members. We apply social identity theory and organizational identification to elucidate the differences between these two types of firms, and how their differing organizational identities reflect unique desires for control and influence. We then consider how these differences are reflected in a firm's board structure (i.e., directorship interlocks, director experiences, and director tenures). Specifically, we predict that family firms are more likely to interlock with other family firms, select directors with more experience in family firms, and keep directors on their boards longer. Correspondingly, we posit that family firms are less likely to interlock with lone-founder firms or to select directors with experience in lone-founder-controlled firms. Lone-founder firms follow a similar pattern. We also consider the consequences of family and lone-founder ownership and board structures on the investment behavior of three classes of institutional investors. We test our hypotheses with a sample of publicly traded corporations between 1991 and 2006, and report strong support for most of our predictions. (c) Academy of Management Journal.

We study whether environmental reporting serves as a transparency tool to communicate sound environmental policies to stakeholders or rather as a manipulation tool of stakeholders' perceptions. In particular, we focus on the relationship between environmental disclosure tone and future environmental performance and we furthermore explore the role of the board of directors' monitoring and stakeholder orientation in shaping this relationship. Using a sample of 288 US oil and gas firms, we find that the bias towards positive language does not reflect purely opportunistic managerial reasons, but rather is a transparency tool to signal future environmental performance. In addition, we document that the stakeholder orientation of the board plays a transparency role in communicating the firm's superior performance. Our findings contribute to the debate on whether discretionary strategies in environmental reporting are more about increased transparency or about stakeholder manipulation. Moreover, they help investors and policymakers to interpret managers' language choices. (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

Organizational boards of directors are one of the most important subgroups within most modern organizations, performing critical advisory, monitoring and resource dependence roles. This paper investigates the crucial question of whether the stock market values ethnic and gender diversity within organizational boards. We find that board diversity is positively associated with market valuation. We distinctively demonstrate further that ethnic diversity is valued more highly by the stock market than gender diversity. By contrast, we do not find any evidence of a significant non-linear link between board diversity and market valuation. Our findings are robust across a number of econometric models that deal with different types of endogeneities and market valuation measures. Overall, our results are consistent with agency and resource dependence theoretical predictions. (c) 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper sets out to shed light on female representation on Italian corporate boards before the introduction of gender quota legislation in 2012, as well as on the relevance of family connections. We investigate the potential determinants of having boards with diverse representation and the correlation between female directorship and family connections, with a focus on governance measures. Research Findings: Using data on all directors of Italian publicly traded companies from 2008 to 2010, we identify two different models. In the majority of gender-diverse boards, at least one woman has a family connection to the controlling shareholder. Family-affiliated women are more common in companies that are small, have a concentrated ownership, are in the consumer sector, and have a larger board. Conversely, non-family-affiliated women are more common on the boards of companies that are widely held, have younger and more educated boards, have a higher proportion of independent directors, and have a smaller number of interlocked directors. With reference to governance-related outcomes, the number of board meetings appears to be negatively correlated to both the presence of family members and female directors. Additionally, women show lower attendance than men at board meetings. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The paper provides support for theories on the differences between the governance of family-owned and non-family-owned companies. Practitioner/Policy Implication: The study offers insights to policymakers implementing gender quota legislation. Substantial effort should be devoted to ensuring that board diversity is associated with actual independence of board members. (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to advance the understanding of the relationship between firm-level governance mechanisms and firm performance using a contingency framework. The contingency framework is based on an integration of agency theory, stewardship theory, resource dependence theory and stakeholder theory of firm governance. Design/methodology/approach - The authors test the arguments on a sample of all the listed firms on the New Zealand Stock Exchange between 2004 and 2007. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, the authors employ random effects, generalized least square estimation to run the regression models. Findings - The authors find that the presence of internal directors, CEO duality, board size and presence of professional directors leads to superior firm performance. A lack of ownership concentration leads to agency problems resulting in inferior performance. However, the positive effect of board independence on firm performance reduces in firms that have a high-ownership concentration. Additionally, a high-ownership concentration attenuates the positive effects of board size and board competence. Originality/value - This study helps reconcile some of the conflicting findings on firm governance-performance relationship. As the findings suggest, the effectiveness of a particular governance mechanism (such as board members) may depend on the presence or absence of another governance mechanism (such as ownership concentration). The integrative, multi-theoretic model that the authors propose in this paper is a unique contribution to the governance literature. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0025-1747

This paper highlights the importance of a firm's board with respect to sustainability issues by analysing the relationship between director interlocks, i.e. directors who simultaneously belong to the boards of directors of several companies, and a firm's environmental performance. The previous literature has focused on the influence of firm-level resources on corporate environmental performance. This study utilizes insights from a resource-based view and research on social capital to demonstrate that the environmental performance of a firm is also influenced by the difficult-to-imitate capabilities that are embedded in the network relationships of its directors. Our results support a contingency perspective of the social capital theory that finds that director interlocks are positively connected with the environmental performance of a firm in two specific situations: (1) when the firm is linked to a larger parent company and (2) in cases of low and high levels of interlock diversity.

One of the institutions in which the gender gap remains a contestable issue is the board of directors, where the proportion of female directors is still low. While some countries have achieved higher proportions of female directors on their corporate boards, others have not registered even a single one. Drawing on social role theory, that places emphasis on traditional gender activities, this study starts by arguing that board directorship is an agentic role and more suitable for men. The study shows that key social institutions have the potential to alleviate such stereotypical attitudes or to maintain the status quo. Employing a robust statistical technique in two-stage least squares (2SLS), this study finds that the representation of women in other key national institutions, such as in politics, positively affects the appointment of female directors on boards. On the other hand, religiosity has a negative causal effect on female board appointments. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose - This paper aims to provide insights on the gender-performance relationship, this paper studies the impact of board gender diversity on firm performance, by taking into account the "critical mass" of women directors and their educational level. Design/methodology/approach - The hypotheses are tested on a unique dataset of 211 European Union publicly listed companies in 2012 belonging to the construction industry from 28 different countries through a set of ordinary least squares regressions. Findings - The evidence shows that the "critical mass" rather than the simple presence of women has an incremental benefit on firm performance. In addition, results show that the educational level of women directors negatively affects firm performance, as it might impact the dynamics within the boardroom. Research limitations/implications - The quantitative nature of the study does not allow drawing strong inferences on behavioral processes and dynamics in and around the boardroom. Nevertheless, this study will open new research insights on exploring the educational level on board. Practical implications - Regulators and policymakers that should be aware of the influence of women as a group on firm performance and that this role is differential across industries. Originality/value - The novelty of this paper is that it investigates the role of women in a high masculine gender-specific industry and explores a still poorly understood demographic variable (i.e. the educational level) of women directors.

Purpose - This paper aims to report the results of an investigation into the effect of corporate governance factors on the performance of listed small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and examines whether this effect differs between the two sizes of business. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses unbalanced panel data regression analysis on a sample of 234 SMEs listed on the Alternative Investment Market, for a 10-year period (2004-2013). Findings - The panel data analysis results show that for all SMEs, corporate governance factors - board size, chief executive officer (CEO) age and tenure and directors' remuneration - are significantly associated with performance of SMEs. The results also suggest that while board size is associated with the performance of both small and medium enterprises, CEO age is significant only for medium firms and directors' remuneration only for small ones, while CEO tenure and proportion of non-executive directors are not significant for either. Practical implications - Overall, the results imply that corporate governance factors affect the performance of listed SMEs. However, this effect differs significantly between small and medium enterprises. The findings have important implications for policymakers who prescribe corporate governance mechanisms for SMEs. Originality/value - The paper adds to existing literature on corporate governance of SMEs by establishing a relationship between firm performance and board size, CEO age, CEO tenure, directors' remuneration and proportion of non-executive directors.

Boards of directors are in a position to contribute vital knowledge resources to strategy-making. We propose that the relation between board functional background heterogeneity and exploration-focused versus exploitation-focused strategy is contingent on the extent to which the institutionally adopted board model enables or constrains inclusion of the board's knowledge resources in strategy-making. We empirically juxtapose the Anglo-Saxon ('one-tier') and Rhineland ('two-tier') board models in the U.K. and Germany, respectively, and find support for our assertion that the influence of board functional background heterogeneity on relative exploration orientation is more pronounced when the adopted board model accommodates inclusion of the board's knowledge resources into strategy-making. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2015 Strategic Management Society.

The main objective of this paper is to explore the role of family councils vis-a-vis corporate governance mechanisms. Particularly, the paper explores whether family councils perform only their distinctive family governance role or if they also substitute for the roles performed by corporate governance control mechanisms. Based on a sample of 243 Italian family SMEs, our research findings show that the family council partially substitutes the shareholders' meeting and the board of directors in playing their respective corporate governance roles of ownership and monitoring. These findings are interpreted in the light of both agency and relational perspectives. (c) 2013 International Council for Small Business.

Research on corporate governance has attempted to investigate the added value of boards of directors through the lenses of both demographic and behavioral approaches. However, investigations into these two approaches, and the subsequent implications for firm performance, have thus far been mainly decoupled from one another. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to put both approaches to the test in the family business context. Using a sample of 567 Spanish family firms, we find that although both approaches can explain the performance of family firms, the behavioral approach explains a much higher proportion of the variation in the firm's performance. Furthermore, our findings support our hypotheses that the relationship between the proportion of outside directors and firm performance follows an inverted U-shape in private family firms, and that both business-oriented and family-oriented board role performance are positively related with firm performance.

This study examines the influence of women on the boards of directors of National Health Service Foundation Trusts (FTs) in England. FTs provide a public service where social performance is the primary objective, although financial constraints must be met. Female presence (the proportion of women) is higher for executive directors than non-executives, reflecting the high number of women employed in the sector. We find that a high female presence among executive and non-executive directorships does not result in significant differences either in financial return or service quality. When gender diversity on boards is consistently high (high level of female presence across boards), the benefits on performance of having more women on the board may not be discernible. However, female Chairs or Chief Executives result in significant reductions in negative social outcomes, such as lower clinical negligence costs, without harming financial management. The findings of this study, carried out in a context of high female presence and where a woman frequently occupies one of the two most influential board positions, Chair and Chief Executive, have implications for gender diversity and gender targets on the boards of directors in business and other sectors.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss a research model that presents three metrics of corporate social performance (CSP): board interlocks, director's profile and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Design/methodology/approach - Based on social network theories, the authors argue the possible relationships between the three variables. The authors conduct the study on 255 directorships in the boards of 20 listed companies in France, which participate in Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for 2010. Findings - The results show that director's background and nationality diversity in the board are the most relevant attributes to discerning firms with high CSR scores. However, the relationship between board interlocks and CSR is not consistent. Some explanations are reported and discussed. Research limitations/implications - The research contributes to recognize the most influential variables in board composition for firms with high CSR scores, although it is based on a conceptual development and an explorative analysis. It could constitute the basis for future research which integrates modeling and multivariate analysis. Practical implications - Diversity in the board could be an effective tool to guide management for more CSR decisions. Social implications - The paper highlights the importance of diversifying the recruitment base when integrating new board members. This implies opening board networks to new profiles, in order to better meet stakeholders' expectations regarding CSR. Originality/value - The paper contributes to board literature by highlighting the importance of combining individual attributes (director) with corporate ones (board of directors) to better assess the role of board of directors in the adoption of CSR' practices.

From the perspective of agency, resource-based view, and resource-dependence theories, we explore the impact of the presence of outside directors on firm performance in family small and medium-sized enterprise (SMEs). Using survey data from 369 Spanish family SMEs, our findings show an inverted U-shaped relationship between the proportion of outsiders on the boards of first- and second-generation family firms and firm performance. The results show that a balanced presence of outside directors contributes to value creation in family SMEs and confirm that the composition and the roles of the board of directors differ from generation to generation in family firms.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine corporate governance practices in an emerging economy. It focusses on how ownership control and board control systems operate in corporate organisations in an emergent economy, assuming that these systems are essential for enhancing good corporate governance practices in emerging countries.Design/methodology/approach: The paper builds on descriptive multiple-case study with multiple units of analysis to divulge how ownership control and board control systems function to ensuring effective corporate governance in publicly listed corporate organisations in Ghana. A criterion-based sampling technique is used to select the companies. Thereafter, three techniques of data collection are used to gather data from the companies: archival records, semi-structured interviews and observation.Findings: By linking the gathered data to the paper's theoretical propositions, the study highlights that all the companies are characterised by the presence of large shareholders, and, in consequence, they tend to exert extensive control over the activities of the companies through their involvement in the decision-making processes. However, whilst the presence of large shareholders has the tendency to solve the agency problem, it poses challenges in regards to minority shareholders' interests in these corporate organisations. The study also reveals that boards of directors tend to exercise control over corporate organisations when majority shareholders stop interfering in their dealings. This implies that when major shareholders fully partake in corporate decision-making processes of companies, boards of directors seem to be sheer advisory bodies to management.Research limitations/implications: This is a paper to shed light on corporate governance practices in four large publicly listed corporate organisations on the Ghana Stock Exchange, so the observable facts do not apply to other emergent economies. In addition, the sample does not represent all corporate organisations in Ghana; thus, the empirical observations cannot be generalised to other organisations that have not been included in this study. However, the empirical results can be applied to other similar corporations in Ghana and other emergent economies in an analytical sense. With the application of inductive reasoning, the results can be applied to provide important appreciation in an effort to understand the structure of corporate governance practices in organisations in developing countries.Practical implications: A comparative analysis of the empirical observations from this study and the recommended guidelines of corporate governance of Ghana has been carried out, and aspects in which organisations need to reform and improve to fully comply with the guidelines are highlighted: director independence, director evaluation, introduction of new directors and board education. This could possibly be the foundation upon which corporate governance structures in these organisations can be restructured and further enhanced.Originality/value: The majority of the studies of corporate governance in emergent economies have used quantitative techniques to examine the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and firm performance. However, this study takes a different approach to examine corporate governance practice in an emergent economy by using a comprehensive and defensible qualitative analysis to examine relations between ownership structure and shareholder control, and board of directors and board control. In addition, it highlights how ownership and board control systems interact in corporate organisations in emergent economies. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The attraction of blue-chip listings in emerging stock markets is a major policy initiative common across much of the developing world. In many cases however, local blue-chip firms are the result of foreign Multinational Enterprise (MNE) firms engaging with local indigenous partners to form an international joint venture (IJV). These are unique with bilateral governance structures underscoring co-ownership between partners of residual cash flows and assets of the IJV. Using a unique and comprehensive sample of 202 IPO firms from across the emerging African region evidence of both a pronounced internal as well as external role for IJV boards was found. Social and political legitimacy concerns dominate the external role of boards in particular. Increasing proportions of boards drawn from commercial and governmental social elites are associated with IJV IPO firms in high institutional quality while lower proportions of these elites are associated with civil code law jurisdictions rather than common law. Governmental elites are associated with country-level improvements in corruption control and political stability while commercial elites are only marginally associated with improvements in political stability, regulatory quality, rule of law and democratic voice and accountability measures.

This research work has as its aim to determine, at international level, the relationship between the composition of the board of Directors and the level of practices associated with corporate social responsibility (CSR). To do this, a sample of 1,043 international companies for the period 2003-2009 was used. The empirical evidence obtained showed an inverted-U relationship between the size of the Board and CSR practices, as well as a balance between independence (independent directors) and information/knowledge (executive directors) of the Board. Furthermore, it was found that the companies with greater diversity among their directors in terms of nationality and gender, as well as a greater activity of the Board to present a higher social, economic and environmental responsibility. Finally, the results have shown that companies from English-speaking countries promote CSR practices to a lesser extent than their continental counterpart (situated in German and Latin-American environments), mainly due to their greater orientation towards the investor.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the importance of human capital and professional networks for women's and men's appointment to the boards of directors of public companies. The study provides an in-depth analysis of how human capital and professional networks contribute to women's as compared with men's odds of corporate board membership. Design/methodology/approach - The study analyzes the human capital and professional networks of 494 male and female corporate outside (non-executive) directors appointed between 2005 and 2010 to the boards of US public companies listed in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. Human capital was measured as director age, education and professional experience (function and role). Professional network variables measured included composition of professional network, network centrality, constraint and cohesion. Findings - The study's findings reveal that the characteristics that impact the appointment of women as outside directors to public company boards differ from those of men. Relative to men, certain professions such as government relations and education improve the odds of appointment of women to corporate boards, while age lowers women's odds. The number of network ties and the degree of network cohesion were also significant in predicting the likelihood of female board appointment to public corporations relative to men's odds. The final model was able to predict female board membership correctly only in 28 per cent of the cases, while male board membership was predicted in 89 per cent of the cases, suggesting that factors other than human capital and professional networks (e.g. their gender) impact women's appointment to corporate boards. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to comprehensively examine the professional network components of female and male directors along with their human capital in the analysis of their prospects for board appointment. The conceptualization of professional networks as well the depth of quantitative analysis of the network components of the study advance the extant literature on the composition of corporate boards.

In recent years, shareholders, regulators, and academics have become increasingly interested in how multinational enterprises (MNEs) can ensure sound corporate governance throughout all entities within a firm. One important mechanism available to MNEs for improving their global governance is the subsidiary board of directors. However, to date scant academic research has focused on the roles of subsidiary boards and the factors that influence their involvement in different roles. Using survey data from a sample of MNE subsidiaries operating in Belgium with headquarters in 14 different countries, we find that a subsidiary board performs four roles: control, strategy, coordination, and service. Further, a subsidiary board is more involved in control, strategy, and service roles if the subsidiary operates only in the local market, independently from the headquarters (the local implementer subsidiary). In particular, the board of the local implementer subsidiary is more involved in strategy and coordination roles when more directors are headquarters country nationals. Our findings collectively suggest that the subsidiary board facilitates a subsidiary's pursuit of its strategic objective and helps to manage the headquarters-subsidiary agency problem. Moreover, subsidiary directors' characteristics influence the subsidiary board's ability to perform its roles. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to test the association between board of director characteristics and corporate reputation. Design/methodology/approachLogistic and multivariate regressions are performed to analyse whether the board of director characteristics are associated with the level of corporate reputation. The sample is composed of listed companies in the Madrid Stock Exchange (Indice General de la Bolsa de Madrid) at least once during the period 2004-2010. Corporate governance data were manually extracted from governance reports released by Spanish companies. The data for the design of a corporate reputation measure were obtained from the Monitor Espanol de Reputacion Corporativa (MERCO) institute web site. FindingsResults from the empirical analysis show that Spanish companies that appear high up in terms of ranking in the reputation index provided by MERCO tend to have a higher percentage of independent directors as well as more female directors on their board. Firm size and the image of the president of a firm are also linked to corporate reputation. Originality/valueThe results have direct implications for the management of corporate governance mechanisms by shareholders who should take into account their role in the creation and maintenance of corporate reputation.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore how initial public offering (IPO) investors view female presence on boards of directors in the USA. Design/methodology/approach - This study utilizes hierarchical regression and analyzes data collected from firms undertaking their IPO's in the USA during 1997 and 2007. Findings - The findings of this study suggest that US IPO investors react negatively to female presence on the board of directors. However, this negative effect has weakened post-Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Research limitations/implications - The results of this study may not generalize to other settings. Practical implications - Gender bias against females in the boardroom exists but appears to be weaker post-Sarbanes-Oxley. Social implications - One hurdle to greater female representation in entrepreneurial ventures in the USA may be weakening as a result of greater awareness of female director contributions to board functioning. Originality/value - First, the study represents one of the few attempts to examine the influence of female directors on organizational outcomes in IPO firms. Second, this study represents one of the first studies to consider the influence of director gender on IPO performance. Finally, this study extends extant research by examining investor reactions to female board presence. The results of this study suggest that bias against females in the boardroom may exist but appears to be weakening post-Sarbanes-Oxley. This finding indicates increasing awareness of female director contributions to board functioning on the part of IPO investors. (c) 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore how an environmental threat (possible quotas for female supervisory directors) might change supervisory board gender composition in SBF120 French company boards between 2008 and 2010. Design/methodology/approach - From a census of supervisory board membership of SBF120 companies in France in January 2008 and December 2010, data were obtained to test hypotheses relating to changes in gender composition of boards and demographic differences between new and earlier director appointees. The authors drew on institutional theory to inform the discussion of this paper's findings. Findings - The authors reveal significant increases over 2008-2010 in SBF120 board female representation and significant cohort differences between recent and earlier appointees. Newer female appointees differed from male peers and from earlier appointed females and males, bringing youth and international experience. New females were more likely to gain CAC40 seats than their male peers. There was an increase in boards with multiple female directors. Research limitations/implications - Actual motivations for increase in female appointments are unknown, but institutional theory provides possible explanations, as suggestion of coercive forces loomed. Chairmen of larger firms may have made strategic choices to attract younger and English-speaking foreign women, before the rush. Limitations include the descriptive nature of the paper, but it sets a benchmark for later studies to monitor progress in depth. Practical implications - The talent pool for female directors has widened to include foreign English-speaking women, bringing a range of new insights and experience of international governance practice to traditional French boardrooms. However, this could be seen as further discriminatory practice that requires female appointees to bring more human and social capital than that required of their male peers. Originality/value - This is the first paper charting the changes in supervisory board composition during the three-year period of environmental unrest as quotas were proposed and legislated in France and comparing new and existing cohort French director demographics.

This article presents a review of the studies on on boards of directors and corporate social responsibility practices in the banking industry. Several characteristics of bank boards, in particular independence and diversity, may impact their CSR commitments. By studying a sample of 159 banks in nine countries during the period 2004-2010, there is evidence that suggests that banks with more independent and diverse directors follow a path of socially responsible behaviour.

Purpose - Director selection is an important yet under-researched topic. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to extant literature by gaining a greater understanding into how and why new board members are recruited. Design/methodology/approach - This exploratory study uses in-depth interviews with Australian non-executive directors to identify what selection criteria are deemed most important when selecting new director candidates and how selection practices vary between organisations. Findings - The findings indicate that appointments to the board are based on two key attributes: first, the candidates' ability to contribute complementary skills and second, the candidates' ability to work well with the existing board. Despite commonality in these broad criteria, board selection approaches vary considerably between organisations. As a result, some boards do not adequately assess both criteria when appointing a new director hence increasing the chance of a mis-fit between the position and the appointed director. Research limitations/implications - The study highlights the importance of both individual technical capabilities and social compatibility in director selections. The authors introduce a new perspective through which future research may consider director selection: fit. Originality/value - The in-depth analysis of the director selection process highlights some less obvious and more nuanced issues surrounding directors' appointment to the board. Recurrent patterns indicate the need for both technical and social considerations. Hence the study is a first step in synthesising the current literature and illustrates the need for a multi-theoretical approach in future director selection research.

The objective of this paper is to obtain empirical evidence of the relationship between board structure, ownership composition, and the level of corporate governance transparency in the largest listed companies of Latin America. A correlational study was conducted with a longitudinal analysis using data from the largest listed comanies in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico during the period 2004-2010. The results show that the level of transparency is higher in companies with larger boards and with a higher percentage of independent directors. Meanwhile, the composition of ownership inhibits the level of transparency in corporate governance, while the presence of family shareholders encourages greater disclosure of corporate information.

We investigate the relationship between corporate board of directors' attributes and conditional accounting conservatism in the French context. Using a pooled regression model over the period 2009-2012, our empirical results can be summarized as follows. First, greater board activity encourages more conservative reporting in financial statements. Second, larger board size diminishes conditional accounting conservatism. Lastly, there is a positive association between gender diversity and accounting conservatism. As a robustness test, we use alternative measures of accounting conservatism, namely time series and accrual-based measures in addition to asymmetric timeliness of earnings. Our findings suggest that boards of directors' attributes are an important factor in determining the financial reporting quality of French firms. (c) 2015, CIBER Institute. All right reserved.

We study how New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) firms adopted governance committees on their boards of directors. The drive to adopt started as a social movement but was facilitated greatly by the collapse of Enron Corporation and a subsequent mandate by the NYSE that all of its traded firms must have governance committees. Using institutional theory and a sample of NYSE firms, we develop and test hypotheses about the speed of governance committee adoption, the likelihood of committee adoption by the NYSE deadline, and the types of directors that were placed on the inaugural governance committee. Our study adds to theory about how organizations respond to external pressures when responding is contrary to the interests of executives. (c) 2013, (c) The Author(s) 2013.

In this article, we build on recent attempts to theorize about the evolution of boards of directors by juxtaposing firms' strategies to gain, maintain, and repair legitimacy onto their life cycle to examine how board characteristics change-both symbolically and substantively-to reflect their firm's evolving legitimating strategy. In doing so, we develop insights contributing to our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the evolving structure and composition of boards of directors. We suggest that boards fulfill an important role ingrained in the firm's legitimacy in addition to, and intertwined with, their substantive contribution to the firm's performance at each life cycle stage. We also address firms' real ability to effect change in their board as a function of the factors that pertain to each stage of life cycle. We conclude by expounding the implications of this novel framework for future research and managerial practice.

Top management teams frequently overemphasize efforts to exploit the current product portfolio, even in the face of the strong need to step up exploration activities. This mismanagement of the balance between explorative R&D activities and exploitation of the current product portfolio can result in the so-called success trap, the situation where explorative activities are fully suppressed. The success trap constitutes a serious threat to the long-term viability of a firm. Recent studies of publicly traded corporations suggest that the suppression of exploration arises from the interplay among the executive team's myopic forces, the board of directors as gatekeeper of the capital market, and the exploitation-exploration investments and their outcomes. In this paper, system dynamics modeling serves to identify and test ways in which top management teams can counteract this suppression process. For instance, we find that when the executive board is suppressing exploration, the board of directors can still prevent the success trap by actively intervening in the exploitation-exploration strategy.

Purpose - This paper aims to fill the gap of the relatively under-researched impact of women directors on initial public offering (IPO) underpricing in developing countries. Gender diversity is an important emerging issue within the corporate governance literature. Recently, there has been a growing thrust on gender-diverse boards. However, their proportion on corporate boards is low worldwide. The paper examines the influence of women directors on the underpricing phenomenon pervasive in the IPO context. Design/methodology/approach - Gender diversity is an important emerging issue within the corporate governance literature. Recently, there has been a growing thrust on gender diverse boards. However, their proportion on corporate boards is low worldwide. The impact of women directors on IPO underpricing in developing countries remains relatively under-researched. This paper aims to fill this gap in research. The paper examines the influence of women directors on the underpricing phenomenon pervasive in the IPO context. Findings - The results suggest that the subscription ratio, listing delay and block holder ownership positively influence raw returns and market-adjusted excess returns. The proportion of women directors showed negative non-significant impact on both type of returns. We did not find evidence of the other explanatory variables included in the model. Research limitations/implications - The relatively low proportion of female directors may be the reason for some of the non-significant findings. Future research with a good gender balance on boards is likely to help generalising the findings. Other confounding factors also need to be included in the model for deeper explanations of the phenomenon. Practical implications - The study highlights the existence of a "glass ceiling" in Indian corporate settings, where women have to make a tough fight. This barrier must be removed to unleash the real talent of women as directors and see this talent reflected in returns. Social implications - The paper highlights both the need to better manage the gender balance in corporate board rooms and the need to incorporate women's talents in corporate and investment decisions. Originality/value - The paper highlights the significant gender gap in IPO directorial positions in developing countries such as India. It explores female directors' contributions in initial pricing performance, which remain unaddressed in this part of the world. Insights into this sensitive issue in an emerging economy such as India can provide important inputs. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited

There is an increasing scholarly interest in how social enterprises manage their hybrid nature. As hybrid organizational forms, social enterprises combine mission-driven social goals and revenue generating activities in a variety of organizational constellations and in diverse institutional contexts. Acknowledging the potentially conflicting demands that institutional environments impose on social enterprises there is an increasing research interest in the existence and proliferation of these conflicting demands at the organizational level. Some researchers have pointed to the importance of particular management practices and governance characteristics - such as authority relations and internal representation - as mechanisms to deal with the conflicting demands at the organizational level. This paper adds to this stream of literature by taking into account the organizational level dynamics of internal representation and the proliferation of factional groups in the boards of directors of hybrid organizational forms and their impact on board performance, ultimately influencing the organizational performance.

Examining board of directors' decision making in case studies of CEOs and board members in four US companies, we found that an "inner board" of directors and CEOs linked by network ties outside of board meetings contained the most influential board members who also shared cognitions about problems. This informal network of ties was affected by the formal governance structure of the board.

Using resource-based logic as well as stewardship and agency theories, we address a paradox when governing young firms-how to design governance structures to encourage top managers to generate rents while minimizing the threat of rent appropriation. Some corporate governance mechanisms (CGMs) enhance empowerment and encourage managers to generate rents for the firm. But these CGMs may also allow managers to appropriate rents excessively. The solution appears to be combining CGMs that empower managers to generate rents with CGMs that either (a) motivate stewardship behavior or (b) reduce information asymmetry between management and other stakeholders. Our empirical analyses provide substantial support for our predictions. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Taking the assumptions of the resource dependency theory as our starting point, the main objectiveof this investigation is to gain an understanding of how and in what way board members who serveon multiple boards (interlocks) can affect a firm's profitability, and whether it is useful to consider thederivation of these interlocks according to the type of board member (executive or non-executive) whopossesses them. Using dynamic panel data analysis (GMM) and a sample of 88 firms quoted on theSpanish Continuous Market for the period 2005-2008, our results confirm the existence of a curvilinear(inverted-U) relation between interlocks and firm performance. The results demonstrate that this relationis only significant if we include the total number of external ties rather than just the number of linksgenerated by non-executive directors. We can also confirm that the degree of familiarity and sharedknowledge between board members (measured by average board tenure) affects this relationship. (c) 2015 AEDEM.

PurposeFrom the resource-based view (RBV), the purpose of this paper is to argue that the board has the capability to participate in international strategic decisions and deal with the environmental complexities that internationalisation brings; and moreover, to achieve better performance than its competitors. Design/methodology/approachThis paper highlights the active participation of the board in firm internationalisation using a sample of 78 Spanish firms quoted on Madrid Stock Exchange. The authors used a longitudinal analysis from 2005 through 2010. FindingsThe results show that while the resources provided by the directors through their level of education and international experience, help them learn and process information, and they are a source of expertise representing "board potential";. A board that functions well through the directors' relationships allow the proper integration and use of these resources, and helps create sustainable competitive advantages in an international context. Originality/valueFrom a RBV, this paper refines and extends the concept of "board capability"; as the combination of potential and internal relations that allow boards to undertake their roles competently over time. Additionally, the paper empirically examines the effect of board capability on firm internationalisation. (c) 2015, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Biotech firms are faced with particularly complex decisions early in their development. Because of the specific nature of their products, their growth strategy rapidly entails the internationalisation of their activities, especially through alliances. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) wishing to develop and access complementary skills may use corporate boards and scientific advisory boards. The resource-based view provides a compelling rationale for efficiently using these external sources of knowledge in order to access the key resources SMEs need to improve their performance. This study investigates how corporate and scientific advisory boards are involved in the internationalisation of biotech firms through strategic alliances. Based on semi-structured interviews and secondary data from 22 biotechnology firms, we describe the characteristics of these external sources of strategic advice and explore their impact on the firms' internationalisation. A discussion of the results, along with their implications for future research and managerial practices are also presented. Copyright (c) 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Decades-long research on boards of directors based on the agency theoretic insider/outsider distinction (Fama & Jensen, 1983) has yielded limited results regarding the effectiveness of boards as monitors of senior management (Johnson, S., Schnatterly, & Hill, 2013) leading governance scholars to incorporate agency theory based distinctions with rich characterizations of the human capital of board composition. This study examines the human capital brought to the boards of directors by active CEOs.

The role of corporate governance in financial institutions differs from that of non- financial institutions for the discretionary power of the board of directors would be limited especially in regulated financial systems where financial institutions are obliged to function through legislative and prescriptive procedures, policies, rules and regulations. This study, therefore, was aimed at examining the impact of corporate governance on the performance of closely regulated Ethiopian insurance Industry. The study employed explanatory research design with an econometric panel data of 10 Insurance companies that covers the period 2007 to 2014. Board size, board independence and board diversity have negative and insignificant effect on the performance of insurance companies while size and independence of audit committee and frequency of board meetings have positive but insignificant effect on the performance of insurance companies in Ethiopia. Thus it could be concluded that all corporate governance mechanisms have insignificant effect on the performance of insurance companies measured by return on asset. This vividly affirms that the role of board of directors in closely regulated financial sector is dismal and insignificant for they have limited discretionary power to exercise as board of directors. Thus it would be recommendable if the regulatory body could relax its prescriptive and stringent policies and devolve its power to board of directors without endangering the viability of insurance companies.

This paper gives the empirical analysis of the impact of the boards of directors' composition and structure and the personal characteristics of the boards' members on corporate performance of Russian public and non-public companies. Hypothesis that describe the influence of the boards' characteristics on corporate performance are tested on the panel data of 200 Russian large and medium joint-stock companies during the period between 2007-2011. As a result, we show that firms' efficiency depends on a number of the boards' characteristics (the share of the executive directors, the number of directors with the working experience in the industry, chairman working in the boards of other companies).

This paper tries to answer the question of top management, public policy makers, researchers and scholars of how important the role of Corporate Governance (CG) and best practices are. Although there are plenty of previous researches, we find it necessary to conduct this study because we believe the outcome will be significant to Bolivia's corporate governance and best practices in order to support and validate the application of the CG's code as management strategy. Likewise, the lack of academic research about this subject in a developing country where these kinds of practices are just starting to be promoted is an important fact, enlightening firms to consider this public policy in order to be more competitive and efficient. We use Pearson's correlations analysis in contrast with multiple regression analysis to examine the significance of Board of directors' characteristics on financial performance ratios and the influence on firm value.

Despite the socio-political, ethical and business case for female board membership, women remain underrepresented in company boards. Using theories that support the membership of women on boards, this article presents the case for gender diversity in the boardroom. By employing a sample of 506 directors from 56 JSE-listed mining companies this article reports on the demographic characteristics, percentage of women in mining boards, and attributes that are predictive of women's membership on boards. Results show that women serving on mining boards possess specialised knowledge in combination with advanced education. They either bring external support as outsiders, or are support specialists with financial, legal, arts and economics backgrounds. This study recommends the development of a talent management framework of women directors focused on their recruitment, development and retention. (c) 2015, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

The strategic role of the board of directors can be a competitive advantage for family firms. In fact, in medium-sized family firms the more the board is involved in the firm strategy, the better performance it gets. However, this relationship is mediated by some variables that may enhance or inhibit this effect. In this chapter, the impact of the entrepreneurial orientation variable is analysed as a mediator between the strategic involvement of the board of directors (SIBD) and performance. We test these hypotheses by surveying the CEOs of 230 Spanish medium-sized family businesses. The results obtained through the Partial Least Square (PLS) technique show that the entrepreneurial orientation of the family firm has a positive effect on the relationship between SIBD and performance.

Despite the growing interest in IJVs and their governance, systematic research is limited on the board of directors and their roles in international joint ventures in emerging markets. In this study, we draw from corporate governance research that suggests that the levels of control and collaboration by boards are influenced by organizational complexity. While joint ventures possess several similarities compared to unitary firms, they also have unique sources of complexity given the fact that two or more international partners collaborate within JVs under an incomplete contract. Based on a sample of 114 IJVs, we argue and show four separate conditions that influence the functions that boards undertake as well as how control and collaboration as two separate functions are interrelated. Our findings address calls for research to open the black box of what boards actually do as well as to bring corporate governance theory to new organizational forms such as joint ventures.

This study empirically analyzes whether gender diversity enhances boards of directors' independence and efficiency. Using data from 3,876 public firms in 47 countries and controlling for a wide set of corporate governance mechanisms, we find that firms with more female directors have higher firm performance by market (Tobin's Q) and accounting (return on assets) measures. The results also suggest that external independent directors do not contribute to firm performance unless the board is gender diversified. These results hold with respect to different estimation models and robustness tests. Overall, our findings provide evidence that the female directors enhance boards of directors' effectiveness. Finally, we find that firms that are concerned with board independence, and that firms in more complex environments are more likely to have gender-balanced boards.

In this paper, we draw on insights from theories in the management and corporate governance literature to develop a theoretical model that makes explicit the links between a firm's corporate social responsibility (CSR) related board attributes, its board CSR strategy, and its environmental and social performance. We then test the model using structural equation modeling approach. We find that the greater the CSR orientation of the board (as measured by the board's independence, gender diversity, and financial expertise on audit committee), the more proactive and comprehensive the firm's CSR strategy, and the higher its environmental and social performance. Moreover, we find this link to be endogenous and self-reinforcing, with superior CSR performers tending to further strengthen their board CSR orientation. This result while positive is also suggestive of the widening of the gap between the leads and laggards in CSR. Therefore, the question arises as to how 'leaders' are using their superior CSR competencies seen by many scholars as a source of corporate (at times unfair) competitive advantage. Stakeholders of corporations therefore need to be cognizant of this aspect of CSR when evaluating a firm's CSR activities. Policy makers also need to be cognizant of these concerns when designing regulation in this field. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Research Question: Whether and how women directors influence firms' engagement in socially responsible business practices and social reputation among diverse stakeholders is unclear due to conflicting empirical evidence, the lack of a coherent theory linking these variables, and inattention to the national contexts in which these relationships occurs. Research Findings: Results from our meta-analysis of 87 independent samples suggest that, while generally positive, the female board representation-social performance relationship is even more positive in national contexts when boards may be more motivated to draw on the resources that women directors bring to a board (i.e., among firms operating in countries with stronger shareholder protections) and in contexts where intra-board power distribution may be more balanced (i.e., in countries with higher gender parity). Theoretical Implications: Future studies should more attentively examine how firms' institutional contexts enhance or mitigate the relationship between women's representation on boards and corporate social performance. Our findings also highlight the need for a comprehensive understanding of the social performance-related knowledge, perspectives, and values that men and women bring to boards. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results suggest that, to enhance any benefits of diversity for corporate social performance, efforts be directed at holding boards more accountable toward diverse stakeholders and improving the status of women in society and in the workforce.

Resource dependence theorists argue that boards of directors with political capital can benefit focal firms by reducing uncertainty and providing preferential resources. Here, we develop theory regarding the downside of board political capital. The problem of principal-principal agency is evident in many parts of the world, and we argue that board political capital can further exacerbate it by enabling large blockholders to undertake more appropriation of firm wealth. Further, we explore how this enabling effect is moderated by ownership-, industry-, and environment-level contingencies. We find empirical support for our arguments using 32,174 directors in 1,046 Chinese listed firms over the period 2008-2011. Our study sheds light on new ways in which resource dependence and agency theories can be integrated to advance the extant research on board governance and corporate political strategy.

In this paper, we investigate the relationship between gender and environmental sustainability. Based on a sample of 296 firms, drawn from the population of US publicly traded firms over a five-year period, we empirically test whether firms that have (1) more gender diverse boards of directors and (2) more policies and practices that enable or reinforce gender diversity throughout the organization, adopted more environmentally responsible policies and practices. We find that both 'demographic' and 'structural' gender diversity are significant predictors of a firm's environmental sustainability initiatives. Our findings show gender diversity is a sustainability issue as well. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

Purpose: This study aims to include two primary goals. First to determine the board characteristics of listed companies in Turkey and second to investigate the effect of board gender diversity on the performance of these companies. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses an instrumental variables regression analysis to investigate the relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance using the data from 2008-2012 of the entities listed on the Borsa Istanbul. Findings: The results indicate that the boards of these companies in Turkey are male-dominated. Moreover, this study shows that the inclusion of female directors is positively related to the financial performance of firms, as measured by the return on assets, the return on equity and the return on sales. Originality/value: Limited empirical studies have been conducted on the relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance in emerging economies. Therefore, there is still no consensus regarding the link between board gender diversity and firm financial performance based upon the mixed and sometimes contradictory results in prior research. Therefore, this study extends the current literature in the context of Turkey, showing that a female member on the board can enhance the financial performance of a company.

We ask whether and when shareholder-oriented foreign owners are likely to change corporate governance logics in a stakeholder-oriented setting by introducing shareholder-oriented governance practices. We focus on board monitoring and claim that because the bundle of practices used in a stakeholder context does not protect shareholder-oriented foreign owners' interests, they seek to introduce their own practices. Our results suggest that board monitoring is only activated when shareholder-oriented foreign ownership is high and that the influence of foreign ownership is especially strong in firms without large domestic owners, with high levels of risk and poor performance. Our findings uncover the possibility of the co-existence of different corporate governance logics within a given country, shaped by the nature and weight of foreign owners Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Excess CEO returns refer to CEO financial returns in excess of shareholder returns. How do boards rein in excess CEO returns? Introducing a social capital view of board monitoring, we suggest that boards face two competing normative pressures - corporate elite norms and monitoring norms. How boards conform to such normative pressures for controlling excess CEO returns is affected by their external and internal social capital. Further, we substantiate our arguments by showing that powerful CEOs and institutional investors may facilitate or constrain the normative pressures existing in the social network and alter the effects of board social capital on excess CEO returns. Data from a sample of U.S. corporations listed on the Standard and Poor's 1,500 index from 1999 to 2010 largely support our framework. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We study the impact of board gender diversity on firm risk-taking in a developing market. Our study is drawn from a sample of 30 Tunisian-listed firms between 1997 and 2010. First, we found that women have a risk perception that leads to risk avoidance behaviour: the presence of women directors, even when there is one woman director, is positively associated with cash ratio. Second, we showed no significant relationship between board gender diversity and the propensity to take strategic or financial risk-taking. Third, the presence of state officer/bureaucrats and/or politically connected women have a positive effect on cash holding and investment opportunities. Finally, we found that foreign investors do not invest in firms with gender-diverse boards. We conclude with a discussion of contributions to scholarship and practice, and present avenues for future research. Copyright (c) 2015 ASAC. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper explores the interaction between a prominent board of directors and the network of inter-firm relationships on new product development. Specifically, we posit a positive interaction effect between a prominent board and the inter-firmnetwork and structural holes positions on the number of newproducts developed by the firm. We test the theoretical framework on a sample of 1758 agreements among 1890 biopharmaceutical firms over the period 2006-2010.We find that by filtering, complementing and legitimizing information coming from the inter-firm network, a prominent interlocking directorate network can improve the inter-firm network's effects on new product development. We discuss important implications for how inter-personal networks (such as the board interlock directorate network) help to develop the effectiveness of inter-firm relationship networks in achieving new product development outcomes.

Agency theory-grounded research on boards of directors and firm legitimacy has historically viewed CEO power as de-legitimating, often taking this fact for granted in theorizing about external assessors' evaluations of a firm. With few exceptions, this literature has focused exclusively on capital market participants (e.g., investors, securities analysts) as the arbiters of a firm's legitimacy and has accordingly assumed that legitimate governance arrangements are those derived from the shareholder-oriented prescriptions of agency theory. We extend this line of research in new ways by arguing that customers also externally assess firm legitimacy, and that firms potentially adjust their governance characteristics to meet customers' norms and expectations. We argue that the cultural-cognitive institutions prevalent in customers' home countries influence their judgments regarding a firm's legitimacy, such that firms competing heavily in highpower distance cultures are more likely to have powerful CEOs, with CEO power a source of legitimacy-rather than illegitimacy-among customers. We also argue that the more dependent a firm is on its customers and the more salient cultural power distance is as a demand-side institutional norm, the greater this relationship will be. Data from 151 U.S. semiconductor and pharmaceutical firms over a 10-year period generally support our predictions. (c) 2016 Academy of Management Journal.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of board diversity on the extent to which firms invest in R&D. Design/methodology/approach - Based on data collected about the composition of the board of directors, the authors determine statistically if the characteristics of directors predicts the extent to which firms invest more in R&D. Findings - The authors find, unexpectedly, that tenure diversity lead firms to invest less in R&D, while education diversity and gender diversity makes firms invest more. Gender diversity positively moderates education diversity as well, strengthening the effect found. Research limitations/implications - The sample of firms the authors include in the paper is restricted due to the overwhelming difficulty in collecting data about the composition of boards of directors, and their backgrounds. Practical implications - The paper offers insights into how boards of directors might need to be composed in order to try have firms invest more in R&D. Social implications - Innovative firms are more competitive and more sustainable. Knowing what contributes to a firm's investment in R&D is thus of great social value. Originality/value - The authors include a much larger set of diversity measures than any previously published study, and provide counter-intuitive findings that have implications for practice, society, as well as theory about team composition.

How do a country's basic institutions enable or hinder women's rise to the boards of public companies? The study evaluates this question with reference to the five basic institutions that research suggests are common across all countries: family, education, economy, government, and religion. The study draws on a sample, which consists of 23 countries, and the study is framed in neo-institutional theory. In analyzing the role of these institutions, the article seeks to understand better the relationships between specific institutions and the share of board seats held by women. The results suggest that four of the five basic institutions are related to the share of board seats women hold. Family, education, economy, and government influence women's rise to the board; however, religion does not influence women's rise to the corporate board of directors.

Research summary: Many boards view their chairs as valuable resources. We predict that whether a board adopts such a view depends on the board chair's human and social capital. Data from S&P 500 firms suggest that while a board chair's human capital increases the probability that the board views him or her as a resource, social capital has no overall effect. In a post-hoc investigation, however, we find the board chair's independence to be an important boundary condition for the effect of social capital. With this exploratory research, we aim to spur research devoted specifically to board chairs. Such research will become increasingly important over time as firms continue to separate their CEO and board chair positions. Managerial summary: The purpose of this research was to determine the factors that lead a board of directors to view its chair as a valuable resource. We expected that board chairs with high human and social capital would be more likely to be viewed as a resource by their colleagues. Surprisingly, only human capital exhibited such an effect overall. Social capital increases the likelihood a chair is viewed as a resource when the chair is independent, but actually decreases the likelihood a chair is viewed as a resource when the chair is either the current or former CEO. These results suggest that boards generally value human capital in their chairs, but view social capital through a somewhat more complex lens. We explore the possible implications of these findings in the article. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study examines how the appointment of former politicians and regulators to boards of directors or management teams influences corporate acquisition activity and performance. We find that bidders with political connections are more likely to acquire targets and avoid regulatory delay or denial. The merger premium paid increases with political connectedness. The announcement period returns show that investors recognize that bids by politically connected acquirers are more likely to create firm value. Connected bidders make more bids and bid on larger targets. Connected acquirers also enjoy superior post-merger financial and operating performance. (c) 2016

Previous studies report inconsistent findings regarding how board monitoring influences firms' research and development (R&D) intensity. This study uses agency theory and resource dependence theory to argue that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between these two constructs. By using board capital theory, the present study also postulates that this curvilinear relationship varies depending on the firm- and industry-specific human capital of outside directors. 467 firm-year observations collected from a randomly selected sample of large public firms from high-tech industries between 2005 and 2010 largely provide empirical support for these arguments. The findings contribute to the corporate governance literature by refining the understanding of the costs and benefits associated with board monitoring. The curvilinear relationship reported herein may also help reconcile prior inconsistent findings. The results also contribute to board capital theory by emphasizing the role of outside directors' firm-specific human capital in the context of R&D investments. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this article, we aim to study the impact on dividends policy of gender diversity on the board of directors (hereinafter BD). We hypothesize that the proportion of women directors, the proportion of independent, institutional, and executive female directors, and the percentage of shares held by female directors on BD, have an impact on the dividends policy of Spanish companies. Our findings, analyzing the whole sample, show that the proportion of female directors and shares held by female directors are positively associated with dividend payout, while the percentage of institutional female directors has a negative impact. The percentage of independent and executive female directors has no effect on dividend payout. When companies with losses are removed from the sample, the findings report that the percentage of female directors on BD and the percentage of independent female directors impact positively on dividend policy, while the percentage of institutional and executive female directors has a negative effect. The proportion of shares held by female directors on BD does not have an effect on dividend payout when only companies with profits are examined. Thus, the results confirm that gender diversity has an influence on dividend payout, so the existing legislation should encourage more participation by women in governing bodies. Our evidence supports the Act for Effective Equality between Women and Men, which establishes that listing companies have to achieve a quota of 40% of women in decision-making bodies by 2015.

Purpose: Board interlocks are a phenomenon of widespread prevalence and one of the most vibrant topics in corporate governance research. However, despite sustained academic interest in interlocks, there has not been a comprehensive review of the literature in nearly two decades. To address this need for an up-to-date review, this paper aims to conduct an assessment and integration of the empirical research on board interlocks. Design/methodology/approach: In reviewing the board interlocks literature, the "systematic review" approach, which emphasizes methodological rigor and transparency, has been used. Using this method, 81 empirical papers that became the focus of this analysis have been identified. Findings: This review reveals that board interlocks research can be categorized based on the theoretical lens used, its focus on antecedents or outcomes of interlock activities and the perspective of the study (i.e. firm- or director-level). Moreover, a number of commonly examined themes have been identified. Several unexpected omissions in the literature have also been uncovered. For instance, it was found that scholars have neither examined the implications of engaging in interlocks in a global context nor have they explored the phenomenon of international interlocks (i.e. interlocks between firms located in different countries). Originality/value: In developing a deeper understanding of the board interlocks literature, this review identifies several topics and disciplines that, if pursued, could enrich the literature and open promising avenues for future research.

Chinese listed companies have a two-tier (dual) governance structure that comprises a supervisory board/committee (SB) and the board of directors (BoD). However, as there is no hierarchical relationship between them, the two boards are independent. This is different from the governance mechanism in Continental Europe in which the SB appoints the directors of the management board; in this sense, the Chinese two-tier governance structure is unique. We investigate the impact of governance characteristics and ownership structure on gender diversity of both the BoD and the SB for a sample of 892 Chinese Initial Public Offerings floated in both the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges. We find that the average proportion of female directors and female SB members on the BoD and the SB are 10 and 22 %, respectively. Using both static and dynamic panel data methods, we find that there is no significant impact of board structure on gender diversity in China. However, we find a positive and significant relationship between SB size and gender diversity. We also find that the higher the state ownership, the lower the female representation on both boards. Finally, our findings show that there is a bi-directional relationship between financial performance and the proportion of female directors sitting on the BoD.

Research summary: We examine how board members' reactions following financial misconduct differ from those following other adverse organizational events, such as poor performance. We hypothesize that inside directors and directors appointed by the CEO may be particularly concerned about their reputation following deceptive financial practices. We demonstrate that directors more closely affiliated with the CEO are more likely to reduce their support for the CEO following financial misconduct, increasing the likelihood of CEO replacement. Enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act similarly alters governance dynamics by creating a greater expectation for sound corporate governance. We demonstrate our findings in U.S. public firms that restated their financial earnings during a 12-year period before and after the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley. Managerial summary: Given past concerns about lack of oversight by boards of directors leading to firm financial misconduct, we examine how the relationship between directors and CEOs may be altered in the face of such misconduct. We argue that directors most closely tied to the CEO (inside board members and board members appointed by the CEO), typically the most supportive of the CEO, may become most concerned about their own reputation following financial misconduct. We find that CEOs receive less support from these directors, a finding in contrast to past studies demonstrating that such board members tend to shield CEOs following poor performance. These findings are accentuated following the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which places greater responsibility on the CEO for the accuracy of financial reports.

Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the impact of women on the board of directors on corporate tax avoidance in Australia. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use multivariate regression analysis to test the association between the presence of female directors on the board and tax aggressiveness. They also test for self-selection bias in the regression model by using the two-stage Heckman procedure. Findings - This paper finds that relative to there being one female board member, high (i.e. greater than one member) female presence on the board of directors reduces the likelihood of tax aggressiveness. The results are robust after controlling for self-selection bias and using several alternative measures of tax aggressiveness. Research limitations/implications - This study extends the extant literature on corporate governance and tax aggressiveness. This study is subject to several caveats. First, the sample is restricted to publicly listed Australian firms. Second, this study only examines the issue of women on the board of directors and tax aggressiveness in the context of Australia. Practical implications - This research is timely, as there has been increased pressure by government bodies in Australia and globally to develop policies to increase female representation on the board of directors. Originality/value - This study is the first to provide empirical evidence concerning the association between the presence of women on the board of directors and tax aggressiveness.

We advance the literature on the demographic factors that shape organizational outcomes by analyzing the impact of the gender composition of firm leadership on the likelihood that a firm will adopt lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT)-friendly policies. Drawing on social role and token theory, we test the relative impact of CEO gender and the gender composition of the board of directors separately and together in order to identify the effects of gender diversity at the top of the organization. We rely on a unique data set that includes corporate policies (gender identity and sexual orientation non-discrimination policies, domestic-partner benefits, and overall corporate equality index scores) as well as the gender of the CEO and board of directors among Fortune 500 firms over a 10-year period. Our findings suggest that firms with gender-diverse boards are more likely than other firms to offer LGBT-friendly policies, whereas findings for firms with women CEOs offer mixed results.

Research summary: We develop a theory to explain why new outside CEOs can better manage their relationship with the board if they previously served on boards that were more diverse than the focal board. We predict that a new outside CEO's prior experience with more diverse boards not only reduces the likelihood of post-succession CEO turnover and director turnover, but also improves firm performance. Results from an analysis of 188 outside CEOs in a sample of Fortune 500 companies provide support for our theory. This study contributes to upper echelon theory and research by identifying outside CEOs' prior experience with board diversity as an important aspect of their background that influences a range of major organizational outcomes, including CEO turnover, director turnover, and firm performance. Managerial summary: It is challenging to be a new CEO who comes from outside of the organization. Our study examines why some new outside CEOs fare better than others. We suggest that a positive relationship with the board of directors is a key factor in a new outside CEO's success. A new outside CEO can better manage the relationship with the board if he or she has prior experience working with other demographically diverse boards. In contrast, when the focal board is more diverse than the other boards on which the new CEO previously served, the new CEO tends to struggle in managing his or her relationship with the board, experiencing a higher likelihood of turnover and delivering worse financial performance.

Recent research on the actual behaviour of boards suggests that more attention should be given to group dynamics in boards of directors. Therefore, we investigate if faultlines are detrimental to the role performance of boards of directors in family firms. In contrast to previous studies that only focus on one attribute, we use a more encompassing measure of faultlines, which is based on three attributes simultaneously (family-membership, type of directorship, and gender). Furthermore, we investigate the moderating role of formal board evaluation. Findings suggest a negative relationship between faultlines and both board control and service role performance. Interestingly, our study indicates that in boards that use formal evaluations, the negative effect of faultlines on control role performance is reversed. We discuss implications for faultline theory and research on boards of directors. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd

This study examines the impact of board decision processes on board task performance in family firms, contingent upon the presence of a family or a non-family CEO. Bridging insights from behavioral research on boards and the upper echelons perspective, it is suggested that influence of board decision processes on performance benefits from different aspects of CEO attributes. To the extent that family and non-family CEOs exhibit different cognitive frames, it is hypothesized that board processes contribute differently to board task performance, depending on whether a family or a non-family CEO is at the helm. An empirical analysis of a sample of Italian family firms provides support for two hypothesized effects: Use of knowledge and skills is more beneficial for board task performance under a non-family CEO; cognitive conflict is more beneficial under a family CEO. Contrary to expectations, the effects of effort norms do not differ between the two settings. This study contributes to research on both boards and family firms; new opportunities for advancements are discussed. (c) 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Although corporate governance researchers have devoted considerable attention to the role of boards of directors in monitoring management and providing resources, less attention has been paid to whether and how they affect the strategic actions of firms in response to changing environments. Taking a process-based perspective, we examine how several prevalent board processes (i.e., board meetings, outside-board-meeting reviewws and information utilization) affect the involvement of boards in strategic decision-making and how such involvement shapes organizational performance. Moreover, we offer an initial attempt to compare the strategic role of boards in for-profit and non-profit organizations. An investigation of 217 for-profit and 156 non-profit organizations in Canada indicates that different processes lead boards to different levels of strategic involvement, and that such effects are contingent on the types of organizations concerned. Moreover, boards that are active in strategic decision-making enhance the performance of their organizations. Our findings have implications for board research and practice.

This study examines how R&D investment is shaped by governance devices. Combining the two agency models of limited competence and managerial opportunism, it suggests that governance devices exert differing effects, in early vs. later stages of CEO tenure. Early in CEO tenure, R&D investment is reduced by stock options and board independence, whereas in later stages these effects reverse: R&D investment is enhanced by stock options and board independence. An empirical test on a sample of U.S. companies provides support for the hypothesized effects. For policy makers, this study implies that R&D investment can be enhanced by setting rules and standards of good governance that take into account CEO time in office and firm context.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to define the contribution of intellectual capital (IC) of the board of directors (BDs) in generating IC of a company, to develop a definition of the IC of the BDs, as well as two of its major elements: human capital (knowledge, skills, and experience of board members, etc.), and social capital (relationships and networking opportunities of board members), and to clarify the relationship between these elements and financial performance indicators of companies based on a literature review on the topic. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review and analysis was applied as this study's research design. Findings: The authors suggest that IC is generated not only by company staff, but also by governing bodies, particularly the BDs, whose members are not always under contract with the company in the traditional sense. Members of the board use their knowledge, experience, and networking opportunities to build IC for effective monitoring, advising, and providing the company with resources. In this sense, the BDs serves as a source of IC for a company, being the main internal corporate governance mechanism that leads to value creation in a company, taking into consideration the interests of all stakeholders. Practical implications: The research indicates that the personal characteristics of board members may influence the performance of a company. Therefore, companies should be recommended to carefully select candidates for nomination to the board. Originality/value: This study contributes to further development of the concept of IC of the BDs by bringing together the theory in the field and the empirical results of studies on the various elements of board capital in a company's value creation.

Manuscript type: Empirical. Research question/issue: We empirically examine the antecedents of shareholder activism related to increasing the gender diversity of corporate boards of directors and whether such activism is an effective mechanism for achieving this goal. Because campaigns for increased gender diversity may be driven by either economic efficiency or social legitimacy concerns, we condition our analysis on activists' motivations for achieving their objectives. Research findings/insights: Based on a sample of US S&P 1500 firms over 1997-2011, we find that female board representation and board independence are negatively associated with the likelihood of being targeted by a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity. We further document that financially motivated activists are more likely to target firms with extremely low female board representation than are socially motivated activists. Targeted firms significantly increase their female board representation in the two-year period following proposal initiation, relative to that of a matched sample of non-targeted firms, with no significant differences observed across activist motivations. Theoretical/academic implications: Our findings provide empirical support for the effectiveness of shareholder activism in shaping corporate governance. Our work also suggests that shareholder activists' underlying motivations are an important conditioning variable in governance research, with both agency theory and institutional theory providing insight into differing motivations. Practitioner/policy implications: Our findings suggest that shareholder proposals are an effective mechanism for increasing board diversity, irrespective of activist motivations. However, we note that mean female board representation for both targeted and non-targeted firms remains far below the level of representation sought by various activist groups. For policy-makers, this suggests that legislative action may be necessary to achieve these corporate board diversity goals in the US. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

New ventures often form a formal board of directors for the first time at the initial public offering (IPO). The tumult of external changes places a premium on rapid decision making within a resource-constrained venture. According to the social psychological theory, group consensus and decision alternatives serve as two key drivers for making rapid decisions. Therefore, based on signaling theory, the valuation from investors at the IPO depends on the observable signals that can imply the group consensus and decision alternatives in a board. We argue and test the hypothesis that, when group consensus and decision alternative signals are jointly considered, the relationship between the ratio of founders on the board and the IPO price premium will have an inversed U shape. In addition, we analyze how three contextual factors (original chief executive officer [CEO], founders' ownership, and venture capitalist [VC] on the board) can influence their signal consistency with founder directors on group consensus and decision alternatives, which ultimately changes the pattern of the inverted U shape. Based on a unique sample of 274 Chinese new venture IPOs over the period from 2004 to 2009, our results show that if the firm is managed by a nonoriginal CEO, the relationship between the founder-board ratio and the IPO price premium is an inverse U shape. Furthermore, if a VC sits on the board, the presence of founder directors has a linear positive effect on IPO premium; otherwise, the inverse U-shaped relationship still holds.

The purpose of this paper is to present and develop a firmer grasp of the underlying dimensions of organizational capacity in nonprofit human service organizations. The paper draws on the resource-based view of the organization (Barney et al. in Journal of Management 37:1299, 2011; Wernerfelt in Strategic Management Journal 5:171, 1984), which recognizes that organizational attributes and capabilities facilitate performance. Interviews were conducted with 66 executives in moderate sized, human service organizations to discuss factors that influence performance. Findings suggest that human, financial, and social capital all contribute to organizational performance. Executives emphasized the quality of people associated with the organization including the role of the board of directors in supporting performance. Many respondents also believed that maintaining healthy and dynamic external relationships was critical to success.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the influence of information and knowledge exchange and sharing between managers and non-executive directors is important in assessing the dynamic processes of accountability in boardrooms. By analysing information/knowledge at multiple levels, invoking the literature on implicit/tacit and explicit information/knowledge, the authors show that information asymmetry is a necessary condition for effective boards. The authors introduce a conceptual model of manager-non-executive director information asymmetry as an outcome of the interpretation of information/knowledge-sharing processes amongst board members. The model provides a more nuanced agenda of the management-board information asymmetry problem to enable a better understanding of the role of different types of information in practice. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis of information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation and the resultant conceptual model are based on the following elements: manager-non-executive director information/knowledge, management-board information/knowledge and board dynamics and reciprocal processes converting implicit/tacit into explicit information/knowledge. Findings - The paper provides new insights into the dynamics of information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation between managers and non-executive directors (individual level)/between management and boards (group level). The authors characterise this as a two-way process, back-and-forth between managers/executive directors and non-executive directors. The importance of relative/experienced "ignorance" of non-executive directors is revealed, which the authors term the "information asymmetry paradox". Research limitations/implications - The authors set out key opportunities for developing a research agenda from the model based on prior research of knowledge conversion processes and how these may be applied in a boardroom setting. Practical implications - The model may assist directors in better understanding their roles and the division of labour between managers and non-executive directors from an information/knowledge perspective. Originality/value - The authors apply Ikujiro Nonaka's knowledge conversion framework to consider the transitioning from individual implicit personal to explicit shared information/knowledge, to understand the subtle processes at play in boardrooms influencing information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation between managers and non-executive directors.

This study examines the remuneration of non-executive directors, examining individual monitoring characteristics and director capital in addition to firm characteristics. Using a large sample of FTSE All-Share non-executive directors from 2001 to 2012, we find that remuneration is positively linked to both directors' individual characteristics and firm characteristics. We find that director age, tenure, and network size are positively related to remuneration, suggesting that directors' ability to contribute to board decision-making and their set of resources are valued by firms. We find that director remuneration is negatively related to monitoring characteristics such as director independence, suggesting possible agency considerations, as effective monitors of top management are paid less. However, director ownership has a non-linear relationship with remuneration, and is substitutive at higher levels of ownership. We also observe that UK boards are relatively homogeneous, with few female directors and even fewer Chairmen, and find strong evidence of a gender gap in remuneration when examining inter- and intra-firm variations. Our findings have implications for regulators who seek to intervene in board appointments, as they indicate that firms do not necessarily value or reward resources brought by female or independent directors.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a review of the literature on the participation of women on Boards of Directors (BD). Design/methodology/approach - The authors review a body of literature (theoretical and empirical words) that analyzes the women's role on the BD of companies. The review allows the authors to bring together the theoretical foundations and the empirical findings of studies that have examined the influence of the engagement of women on BD on the business outcomes of the firms involved. Findings - There is no agreement on the results relating to the effect of the presence of women on these boards. Moreover, there is no well-defined theoretical basis to explain this relationship, making it necessary to use a multi-theoretical approach. Research limitations/implications - This study could be extended by including investigations of the intermediate variable between the composition of the BD and the business outcomes, thus enabling an analysis of the effects of different organizational variables on the economic and financial variables already studied. In addition, the authors propose a comparative study between different countries and between different kinds of companies. Originality/value - This paper highlights the controversy that exists over the significance of the involvement of women on the BD of companies. It also proposes the development of new lines of research to attempt to answer some of the questions that are raised by the diverse findings reported in the literature.

Purpose-By looking at both theoretical and empirical findings, this study aims to investigate whether gender diversity results in improved corporate governance and financial performance for companies. Design/methodology/approach-An analysis of the board composition of the Johannesburg Securities Exchange Top 40 companies as at 30 June 2013 and a comparison of the financial performance of the company were conducted. Findings-Female directors were found to make up, on average, 18.78 per cent of the board of directors, with the majority of these women being in non-executive positions. Women representation appears to influence company performance positively when using accounting-based measures of performance (such as return on assets and return on equity), but negatively when using market-based measures (such as Tobin's Q). The critical mass concept is also assessed and is found to have a positive effect. Originality/value-These findings are of relevance to the boards of directors adhering to corporate governance requirements by challenging the role of women on the board of directors, as well as that of investors and those in practice, to understand the current status of women representation.

This study examines the role of the top management team (TMT) and governance structures in the use of corporate venture capital (CVC) in firms that have recently undergone an initial public offering (IPO). The study is unique in that it sheds light on governance-related antecedents of strategic decision making in such firms. We integrate the insights of behavioral agency and upper echelon perspectives to develop our hypotheses. Our results show that in the presence of non-duality, a negative curvilinear relationship exists between TMT heterogeneity and the use of CVC. We also find that TMT heterogeneity and ownership motivate the use of CVC but only up to a certain threshold. Our findings contribute to the literatures of entrepreneurship and strategy.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine in greater depth the concept of "board capital", which the authors consider to be a bundle of three types of capital, and believe to be a clear antecedent of the board's ability to perform its roles, which have positive consequences for the firm's performance. Design/methodology/approach: Through 83 firms listed on The Madrid Stock Exchange during the period 2005-2010, the authors test empirically the relationships between different dimensions of board capital and firm performance, and specially how internal social capital moderates the relationships between board human capital and external social capital with firm performance. Findings: The results show that certain characteristics of human capital (average board tenure) and external social capital (directors' interlocks) are positively related to the firm performance. The empirical findings also indicate that the internal social capital, measured by board density, is positively related to the firm performance and moderates these above relationships, increasing the potential of the resources contributed by the board members and influencing to a large extent on a firm's performance. Practical implications: The results of the investigation will help both executives and scholar in two ways. First, they will assist firms when they have to select board members, as they can now understand how the resources that board members bring with them can affect the firm performance. To be more effective, boards need to have members that have experience as firm's directors, external connections to other boards and many internal ties among them. Second, in this context, internal social capital is especially relevant, so the firms should look for possible ways of encouraging internal ties between directors. In this paper, the authors have opted for study the participation of directors in committees. Originality/value: The authors propose that these three types of capital (human, external and internal social capital) need to be synergistically combined to create a group of directors with access to a complete set of skills, knowledge and connections, but which can still work as a compact social group when making decisions.

This paper examines the firm-level antecedents of Six Sigma adoption in Korea. Our results indicate that firms with top executives and board members having work experience in the foreign country where the focal management practice originated and was popularized are more likely to adopt this practice. Furthermore, firms' exposure to foreign investors exerts a direct effect and also moderates the impact of foreign work experience on adoption. Prior work experience in the country of practice origin reduces the uncertainty inherent in cross-border adoption by providing executives and board members with greater insight into the presumed benefits of the focal practice.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine whether board-related characteristics matter for cost efficiency in banking sector. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a sample of publicly traded US commercial banks and savings institutions to estimate a relationship between cost efficiency measured by stochastic frontier analysis and a set of board-related characteristics for the period 2007-2013. Findings: An inverted U-shape relation is found between board size and efficiency. Thus, there is a trade-off between costs and benefits of larger boards. Optimal board size is higher for banks with more complex operations. This study also observed an inverted U-shape relation between board independence and cost efficiency. The banks where the Chairman also executes the CEO responsibility show lower efficiency. However, a higher proportion of independent board members in banks with unitary leadership structure may mitigate the conflict of interest and lower efficiency stemming from CEO duality. Research limitations/implications: This study's evidence supports the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision emphasis on advising a board composition that provides for a sufficient degree of director independence. Practical Implications: The results are relevant for banks and their external and internal stakeholders. Banks may adjust their current board characteristics to increase the board effectiveness. Externally, potential investors can evaluate the quality of corporate governance of banks before making investment decisions. The empirical findings can also be useful for regulators imposing corporate governance codes in banking. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to provide empirical evidence on the impact of board characteristics on bank efficiency for a wide panel of US banks. Additionally, a comprehensive set of board-related variables is used. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to extend the current research on corporate philanthropy and organizational outcomes by empirically exploring two specific types of antecedents: board of director composition and industry membership. Design/methodology/approach - A theoretical framework was developed based on the resource dependence and stakeholder theories which suggest that the extent that firms build relationship with certain stakeholders is closely tied to the personal and social background of board members, in turn influencing the allocation of resources to corporate philanthropy. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis as well as analysis of variance with post hoc comparisons was conducted using multi-year data philanthropic data from 104 US corporations. Findings - The results provided empirical support for a positive relationship between the number of female board directors and the level of corporate philanthropy. In addition, the results showed significant inter-industry variations in the level of corporate philanthropy. This indicated that the rather aggressive role of philanthropy in mitigating reputational challenges associated with product-market dysfunctions. Contrary to the theoretical predictions, the results did not support a positive relationship between the proportion of outside directors and level of philanthropy. Research limitations/implications - The authors believe the empirical finding on the relationship between industry membership and corporate philanthropy is a significant contribution to the philanthropy literature. Accordingly, by empirically showing the disproportionately higher level of philanthropy by some prominent industries (such as gas and oil, financial services and chemical) than their counterparts, the authors contribute to the understanding of sector-level determinants of corporate philanthropy. Practical implications - Since board of directors have a direct involvement in reviewing and approving major corporate initiatives, the choice of these directors is more likely to influence the amount of resources committed to philanthropic causes. Consistent with other studies in the larger corporate social responsibility research, the authors found that more women directors on the board are associated with greater philanthropic spending. Hence, a major implication of the study is that shareholders and the general corporate community need to pay close attention into who is elected to serve as director of business organizations as these directors' background and experience could shape major social responsibility initiatives such as corporate philanthropy. Originality/value - By empirically investigating the relationship between board composition and philanthropy, this study extends the scholarly discussion to focus on the role of the board in shaping the level of firm commitment in overall CSR. In addition, this study provides empirical evidence on the role of industry context in the level of commitment in corporate philanthropic activities. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study presents evidence of the influence of gender diversity on the pay system and the monitoring of executives in Spain. In this country/context, characterized by a few male dominant shareholders acting simultaneously as executives, there is an ongoing discussion regarding the enactment of laws to promote gender equality on the boards of directors of large listed companies. This paper presents several contributions. On the one hand, the scarce previous evidence on this topic is focused on US firms. On the other hand, this study includes the role of ownership structure as a factor that indirectly moderates the relationships between gender diversity on board and monitoring effectiveness in terms of executive directors' compensation. Furthermore, this paper makes an important effort to control endogeneity. The sample examined includes 120 companies listed on the Spanish stock market during the period 2004-2011. The results show a positive and highly significant effect of the presence of women independent directors on the proportion of variable pay in the compensation of executive directors. Our findings also point out the negative moderating effect of ownership concentration: the more concentrated is ownership in the hands of internal majority shareholder, the less is the link between board diversity and pay-for-performance systems.

In this study, we examine how board characteristics, such as the independent director ratio, board size, and the number of interlocks, influence the investment of slack resources into research and development (R&D) by a firm. Both the agency theory and resource dependence theory predict a positive influence of independent director ratio on the financial slack-R&D investment relationship. However in the case of board size and number of interlocks, resource dependence theory argues for a positive moderating effect, while agency theory predicts a negative effect. The hypotheses are tested on the seven-year panel data of 172 firms in the Indian pharmaceutical industry, an emerging economy, high technology industry. We find broad support for the resource provisioning role of the board of directors, which is attributed to the emerging economy context of the Indian pharmaceutical industry, where firms face high levels of opportunity but lack resources to make use of them effectively.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper was first to find out whether the negative relationship between board size and future firm risk persists in China while contemplating all sorts of endogeneity. Second, the authors have investigated the role of large shareholders in influencing the managerial decisions concerning future firm risk via board size. Finally, the authors examined whether the moderating role of large shareholders is any different in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-state-owned enterprises (NSOEs) in China. Design/methodology/approach: The sample included all the A-listed firms listed on the Shanghai and the Shenzhen stock exchanges over a sample period from 2008 to 2013. The authors used fixed effects regression and the generalized method of moments (GMM) to test the three hypotheses. Findings: The authors found that board size is negatively associated with future firm risk when measured as volatility in future stock prices and future cash flows. Second, large shareholders directly influence managerial decisions about future firm risk, irrespective of board size. Third, the moderating role of ownership concentration is insignificant in both SOEs and NSOEs. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study which has analyzed the role of large shareholders in the relationship between board size and future firm risk. This study provides valuable insights, particularly in the context of a developing country, into the role played by large shareholders in influencing managerial decisions concerning future firm risk.

In theory, nonprofit boards of directors exist to perform mission-setting and oversight functions that help to ensure organizational accountability. Yet there is evidence that board behavior often falls short of this ideal. Using survey data from a sample of 241 executive directors of nonprofit agencies, we investigated whether nonprofit boards are meeting executive directors' expectations, and if not, what factors explain this? We find that although board behavior tends to align closely with executive directors' preferences for involvement in administration and management tasks, there is a greater disconnect between board behavior and executive directors' preferences for involvement in mission-setting and oversight duties. Factors that mitigate this gap include organizational professionalization and stability, whereas more extensive reliance on government funding exacerbates it. Female executive directors experience a greater disconnect in their preferences for board involvement and actual board involvement than male executive directors. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for both theory and practice. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Research summary: The formation of interorganizational ties is a consequential phenomenon examined in strategic management research. Beckman, Haunschild, and Phillips (2004) is one of the first studies to comprehensively consider interorganizational network change by exploring factors that affect both alliance and board interlock formation. They find that firm-specific uncertainty relates to broadening actions, whereas market-level uncertainty causes firms to reinforce current structures. Our replication considers whether these relationships operate similarly in a differing temporal context. Building from the framework of the original study, we suggest our findings offer intriguing new empirical evidence highlighting the importance of time as a boundary condition in understanding embedded firm actions. Managerial summary: The development of interorganizational relationships, such as alliances and ties between boards of directors, has an important impact on innovation, strategic actions, and firm performance. This study examines whether the dynamics of interorganizational relationship formation remain consistent over time. We replicate earlier work by Beckman and colleagues (2004), but with an expanded data set covering more than 20 years. Over this broader time horizon, we find a shift in behavior, with companies facing firm-specific uncertainty seeking to reinforce their current relationships and companies facing industry-wide uncertainty seeking to diversify their risk by expanding their network. Our results demonstrate the importance of replication studies in research and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complexity surrounding interorganizational relationships.

The growing importance of board diversity among directors has been established as a result of global financial crisis in 2008. According to the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance 2012, nominating committee shall be responsible to select directors with diverse background that meet the needs of the company. This paper attempts to examine the impacts of having female directors in a nomination committee on gender diversity on board. For this purpose, 393 (50%) non-financial Malaysian listed companies were selected for the three year period of 2011 to 2013. Results indicated that having female directors in a nomination committee is significantly related to the level of gender diversity on board. The results also signify the importance to have female directors in nomination committee as it will influence gender diversity on board. (c) 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to empirically assess the effect, if any, of family ownership and busy boards on companies' Tobin's Q and cash holdings in France. Design/methodology/approach - Using a multiple regression analysis for panel data, the author investigate the impacts of being family-owned and of multiple directorships on cash holdings and then on Tobin's. Findings - Family ownership seems to have no significant effect. The most significant finding is that family-owned companies are smaller and work in the manufacturing and construction sectors compared to non-family-owned companies. However, multiple directorship is not negatively related to firm performance in France. Research limitations/implications - The current study focusses solely on France, which, even though different from the more usual American perspective, is not enough to make broad generalizations. It is however, a useful step toward better understanding the issues at hand. International data on family firms and busy boards, while hard to come by, would further enhance the knowledge of corporate governance. Originality/value - It is interesting to know if family-owned companies and those with multiple directorships perform differently from others, especially in a context where organizations can choose between a one-tier or two-tier system of governance, as is the case in France.

The question of whether a "good" corporate board structure can optimize performance and minimize conflicts between managers and shareholders has been widely debated. Because mergers and acquisitions represent major managerial investment decisions that are subject to board scrutiny, the effectiveness of a board's structure is especially visible in the context of corporate acquisitions. With that in mind, in this paper, we examine the abundant literature in the fields of strategic management, economics, and finance in order to identify which board attributes contribute to the ability of corporate boards to create value through mergers and acquisitions. In particular, we discuss the impact of four board attributes: (1) board independence, (2) board size and director-specific attributes, (3) board ownership and compensation, (4) multiple directorships. As a result of our analysis, we conclude that the impact of board attributes on shareholder wealth in mergers and acquisitions is specific to each firm. Therefore, board regulations that do not reflect a firm's specific needs may in fact hinder the creation of a board that is capable of responding effectively to the firm's unique needs and circumstances.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate board director disciplinary and cognitive influence on corporate value creation. Design/methodology/approach: Fixed-effect regressions are used to check whether gender diversity, education, independence and size of the board of directors affect measures of corporate value creation. Findings: The empirical results show that corporate value creation is positively influenced by the cross effect of the board independence and the presence of women. They also point out a positive impact of the cross effect of board independence and management education. They reveal that the board of directors contributes significantly to corporate value creation, particularly when there is a mix of independent, female and management-qualified directors. Originality/value: The evidence presented and discussed in this paper should be of interest to managers and regulators. The methodological approach and the empirical results extend the existing literature. They enrich the limited empirical research devoted to this theme, especially in a continental European context, i.e. France. They shed light on the effect of board of directors' disciplinary and cognitive influence on corporate value creation. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper examines the effects of board quality on the relationship between corporate bankruptcy and nomination committee effectiveness. We argue that the proportion of outside directors, a proxy of board quality, arguably captures the extent of board control and resources. Based on dataset from 1835 firm-year observations for 98 bankrupt and 269 non-bankrupt UK listed non-financial firms between 1994 and 2011 and using the agency and resource dependence theories, we predict and find that nomination committee effectiveness negatively affects corporate bankruptcy and that board quality mitigates the negative effects. The results lend support to the notion that firms benefit from board quality in terms of outside directors' ability to monitor CEO on behalf of shareholders and also provide advice, counsel and legitimacy to the firm. This study extends the present research on corporate bankruptcy by providing evidence on the impact of board quality and nomination committee effectiveness on UK corporate bankruptcy.

In countries with weak institutions, board governance becomes more important. This study uses a unique dataset from listed sub-Saharan African companies to examine the relationship between ownership composition and board compensation. It further analyses the association between board compensation and company performance. The findings indicate that board ownership and chief executive officer ownership are positively associated, whereas state ownership and concentrated ownership are negatively associated with board compensation. There is no evidence of a significant association between chairperson ownership or foreign ownership and board compensation. Finally, there is a negative but not significant relationship between board compensation and company performance.

Quasi-Governmental Organizations (QGOs) are organizations that have both public and private characteristics, not fitting neatly into either category. One type of QGO is an organization incorporated as a private, nonprofit organization, but run by a board of directors that is composed of government officials or directors appointed by a unit of traditional government. These QGOs pose distinct conceptual and policy challenges that differ from those of traditional government entities or purely private nonprofits. Drawing on a convenience sample of five such QGOs incorporated in one metropolitan region (Greater Cleveland, Ohio), this piece explores potential reasons for, and possible pitfalls of, mixing private organizational legal status with public-affiliated leaders by developing a framework and proposing a research agenda for future study.

Purpose - The chapter builds on the literature of Agency and Signalling Theories to analyse the corporate governance factors associated with the voluntary decision to prepare an Integrated Report according to the International Framework promoted by the IIRC. Methodology/approach - The chapter is based on the results of a probit regression run with regard to a sample of 35 companies that joined the Pilot Programme in 2011 and 137 similar companies that did not. Findings - The analysis of two samples of European companies reveals that adhesion to the IR Pilot Programme is positively related to the gender diversity and size of the board. Research limitations - Further research is required in order to study the differences between listed and non-listed companies in terms of variables affecting the adoption of the Framework and to increase the time range of our study. In addition, it would be interesting to include other variables capturing different aspects other than corporate governance, since the decision to join the Programme, as the results of our analysis have shown, may also be influenced by other factors, such as strategy decisions and communication policies. Originality/value - The chapter adds to the existing literature by showing the main governance characteristics that impact the decision to adhere to the IR Pilot Programme. It is also important to the existing literature regarding the role played by gender diversity in corporate governance mechanisms and CSR policies.

A code of corporate governance was introduced in Sweden in 2005. Although the code is mandatory, a company is allowed to override specific rules if it openly discloses the deviation and explains why it does not comply. The aim of this study is to explain how the governance structure, operationalized as the ownership structure, the board and the auditor, affects companies' propensity to deviate from the Swedish Code. The empirical data in this study are based on the 2010 annual reports from 193 companies listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange and data from the Swedish Corporate Governance Board. The findings show that concentrated ownership, smaller boards with directors with long tenure and audit firms with a high proportion of employees compared with partners increase the likelihood of deviance.

Initiation and support from boardrooms are factors that are important to a Taiwanese firm's ability to change its strategic orientation from manufacturing to branding. We examine whether board members' educational backgrounds contribute to firms' branding success. We find that firms are more likely to be successful in brand development when their board members have been educated at top-ranked universities, foreign universities, and top MBA programs. The results are more robust when branding is successful at a global rather than a domestic level. Our argument is further supported by the finding that the educational background of board members is more relevant for branding success in industries with more mature branding practices.

As the civil society and corporatism theories have been frequently challenged recently, alternative theories emerged to investigate the government-ngo relationship in China. Some new theories are largely related to resource dependence or share core ideas with it. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of the resource dependence theory. It identifies four groups of variables (organizational characteristics, board of directors, attitude and value, and external environment), finds support for their relevance from both Western and China scholarship, and applies them to the Chinese context. The resource dependence theory has the potential of empirically examining the relationship without over-focusing on the state or society. It is capable of explaining the dynamic and diverse relationships between the government and various ngos in China. (c) 2016 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the evolution of corporate governance in Nigeria and how the duplication of code of corporate best practices is impacting compliance with the key recommendations of these guidelines. The issues of corporate governance and reforms especially those related to the development and implementation of code of corporate best practices have been a subject of academic discuss over the years with more research emphasis placed on developed economies. This paper intends to add the sub-Sahara Africa and the emerging economic perspective to this vibrant stream of research. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts an explanatory approach in the review of the four different codes of corporate governance that were issued in Nigeria in the past ten years. Findings: The paper demonstrated that corporate governance has been a fundamental issue of concern in Nigerian public enterprises since the country gained independence in 1960. The paper equally established that the application of recent corporate governance reforms has been challenged, not on competency grounds but rather by the proliferation of codes which have created implementation and monitoring difficulties for both the affected firms and the regulatory agencies. Originality/value: Unlike other previous studies, this paper offers comprehensive analysis of corporate governance evolution in Nigeria and found through documented literatures that shortage of experienced local personnel and the absence of effective external control mechanisms have been the bane against the development of corporate governance in Nigeria. The originality of this paper also lies in being the first paper to have linked developments in the public enterprises to the renewed focus on corporate governance. This is the most inclusive paper to have identified key implications of multiplicity of corporate governance codes and the direct application of governance system within the context of the country's socio-cultural distinctiveness.

Despite extensive research on the internationalization-performance relationship, our understanding of the role of board of directors in the internationalization of emerging-market firms remains relatively limited. In addition, research pertaining to the board's influence on firm performance has tended to focus more on board content than on its processes. In an attempt to address this research gap, we study the contingent role of the board's capabilities on the relationship between internationalization and performance, in emerging-market firms. We propose that board tenure will have a negative moderating effect, whereas board members' experience as CEO or general manager, industry-specific experience, international experience, and level of academic achievement will have positive moderating effects. We argue that, in the context of emerging market firms, board interactions are particularly important, and propose that moderate levels of board interaction will be most beneficial for the internationalizationperformance relationship.

In the aftermath of the Asian Financial crisis in 1997/1998, the Malaysia Securities Commission (SC) issued the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance in 2000 (MCCG 2000). It was subsequently revised in 2007 following the Enron and Transmile debacles. In 2012, the SC issued the latest MCCG 2012 which introduced several new recommendations that are in line with developments in other parts of the world. Hence, the purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of the structure of the board and its activities on firm performance post MCCG 2007. The study also aims to shed light on the effectiveness of the board of directors since the issuance of MCCG 2000 and of MCCG 2007. It also aims to reveal the preparedness of listed firms in Malaysia to embrace MCCG 2012. Using a population of non-finance listed firms for the 2009, 2010 and 2011 financial years, it was found that board independence, chief executive officer (CEO) duality, directors' busyness, nomination committee independence, the establishment of a risk management committee (RMC) and board meetings are not associated with firm performance, i.e. Tobin's q. However, the market appears to be in favour of a larger board size. As for return on assets (ROA), it is not associated with board independence, board size, directors' busyness and nomination committee independence. On the other hand CEO duality and the establishment of a RMC improve ROA, while board meetings are detrimental to ROA. It can therefore be concluded that board independence is not associated with either Tobin's q or ROA. Hence, any corporate governance reforms should not over-emphasize the representation of independent directors on the board, rather the focus might be shifted to board activities, such as board meetings and the establishment of a RMC. With regard to board size, since the market is in favour of a larger board size, firms should increase the board's size to enable the appointment of women directors to the board. Finally, combining the CEO and board chairman roles should not be disallowed as the market views this favourably. Hence, the 'one-hat approach' does not appear to be applicable in the case of CEO duality. (c) 2016, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

Committees on a board of directors are now subject to recommendations by regulations in practically all jurisdictions. At the same time, scholarly work on the topic has escalated since the mid-1990s. In this review article, we examine relevant literature on board committees of audit, compensation and nomination, as part of corporate governance research in general, over the period of 1988 to 2011. We observed an exponential growth in contributions over time, the majority of which can be attributed to management and accounting scholars. The audit committee is the most researched of all three committees, with the nomination committee being the least researched. An analysis of the literature generated a picture that included the following features: 1) the dominance of the agency theory; 2) a lack of other unifying theoretical frameworks; 3) a strong US-centrism; 4) the prevalence of quantitative research methods.

The governance structure and financial performance of organizations have the potential to support the strategic direction of organizations in embedding social and environmental initiatives into their business activities. This is because CSR initiatives require top management commitment and support from stakeholders. In addition, the availability of financial resources could further enhance the CSR initiatives and influence strategic development. The aim of this study is to examine the influence of governance structure (specifically ownership and board structure) and financial performance on CSR reporting among Malaysian public-listed companies. The agency and signaling theories have been employed to underpin the theoretical perspectives of the study. The data for this research was sourced from content analyses of both the annual and sustainability reports of the top 100 public-listed Malaysian companies. The study reveals that board independence, board size, and the presence of women directors on the board significantly influence the reporting of CSR information. Nonetheless, government and foreign ownerships were not significant determinants of the reporting practice. In terms of financial performance, profitability was found to be significant in signaling the behavior of companies to disclose CSR information. Overall, the results of the study largely imply that board structure and profitability of organizations are critical towards the enhancement of CSR initiatives of companies. Social implications: Findings of this study indicate the positive role of women directors on the extent of CSR disclosure, which encourages diversity in the board of directors.

This paper seeks to provide a better understanding of what makes boards effective. We analyse the relationships between board demography and company performance and between working structures and board tasks in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We test our hypotheses on a sample of 307 Spanish SMEs. The main empirical result is the negative impact that the proportion of outside directors and the board size have on firm performance. We also find a negative impact of outsiders' presence and a positive impact of director tenure on the board's service role. Our analysis of the role of board control highlights the negative relationship between this variable and CEO tenure.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze certain organizational changes that occur after privatization. More specifically, the authors analyze from an agency theory perspective how changes at the corporate governance level (ownership type/structure and board of directors) influence firm strategy, and what implications these issues have for the design of compensation mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology employed in the study can be described as a longitudinal multiple case study approach. A multiple case study enables the comparison of pre- and post-privatization periods in five Spanish companies. This methodology is especially suitable to track the organizational changes occurring in relation to the firms' internal management. Findings - First, the variables that traditionally relate to greater board independence in monitoring do not suffer from variation after privatization. Second, the interests of the firms' new ownership have an impact on firm strategy after privatization. Finally, compensation system design clearly aligns with firm strategy after privatization. Research limitations/implications - The research is based on a multiple case study approach, which limits the scope and generalizability of the findings. Originality/value - Whereas research in privatization generally adopts a macroeconomic or political perspective, organizational and managerial implications are current aspects in need of further examination. This research offers a study that integrates three sets of variables (corporate governance, strategy and compensation) that have been rarely analyzed in this context.

The aim of this paper is to determine to what extent globalization pressures are changing interlocking directorate networks modeled on continental capitalism into Anglo-Saxon models. For this purpose we analyse the Spanish network of interlocks, comparing the present structure (2012) with that of 1993 and 2006. We show how, although Spanish corporative structure continues to display characteristics of the continental economies, some major banks are significantly reducing industrial activity. Nevertheless, the financial organizations continue to maintain a close relationship with sectors such as construction and services. The analysis of the network of directorates shows a retreat in activity of industrial banking in Spain. Two large Spanish financial institutions, BSCH and La Caixa, continue to undertake activities of industrial banking in 2006, but this activity is significantly reduced in 2012. According to the theories on the role of the interlocking directorates, the companies in these sectors assure their access to banking credit by incorporating advisors from financial organizations to their board of directors. We cannot conclude that the structure of the Spanish corporate network has become a new case of Anglo-Saxon structure, but we got indications that are becoming less hierarchic as banks seem to slowly abandon centrality positions. This is especially salient if we compare the networks of 2006 and 2012, which show a continuing decrease of the role of banks and insurance companies in the network.

This article aims at assessing the influence of women in the board of directors (BOD) on risk management in Vietnamese firms. The study touches upon a sample of 284 companies listed on the HOSE (Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange - Vietnam) in the period of 2008-2014. Their data was regressed by the random effects model (REM) and the fixed effects model (FEM). To find out which method is the most appropriate, we used the Hausman test. The study clarifies women's role in society and the optimal ratio of women in the BOD to minimise risks at enterprises. The authors give recommendations to corporate managers regarding proper employment policies, in which the role of women is better recognised. The most valuable result of the presented research is a grounded finding of an optimal female ratio in the BOD recommended for the Vietnamese enterprises. In order to achieve a positive impact of women on the risks reduction at the enterprise, the suggested female ratio in the BOD should be 34.96%, which will help to keep the lowest risk exposure. Hence, it could be recommended to raise a number of women in the BODs to approximately 1/3 of the total amount of members. Business owners may take this into account when planning human resource policies to maximise business performance. (c) 2016 Institute of Society Transformation.

Corporate governance regulation has been through numerous cycles of reform, and yet we still see instances of companies collapsing suddenly. Codes of corporate governance have been implemented in most developed countries, recommending detailed governance frameworks for publicly listed companies and their boards, but our understanding of how these codes influence behaviour is still limited. In this book, Alice Klettner draws on the domains of law and business to explore the effectiveness of corporate governance codes. Using interview evidence from company directors and officers, as well as published evidence of companies' corporate governance systems, she discusses the theory and practice of corporate governance and its regulation - with a focus on how corporate governance codes can affect board behaviour and company performance. This interdisciplinary book will be valuable reading for advanced students and researchers of corporate governance, and will also be directly relevant to governance practitioners and policymakers.

The previous literature suggests that firms may use the characteristics of the board members as a signal for building their own image. The objective of this paper is to analyze whether the number of appointments of directors influences corporate reputation. For that, we focus on a sample of US firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for the period 2007-2010 and we examine a total of 30,813 directors. Our results indicate that there is a curvilinear relationship between the number of directorships of board members and corporate reputation. These findings shed some light on the value of boards of directors and also have implications for companies in the selection of board members. (c) 2016 Virtus Interpress, All rights reserved.

Well performed companies have always been linked with effective governance which is generally reflected through effective board of directors. However many issues concerning the attributes for effective board of directors remained unresolved. Nowadays diversity has been perceived as able to influence the corporate performance due to the likelihood of meeting variety of needs and demands from diverse customers and clients. The study therefore aims to provide a fundamental understanding on governance among high performing companies in Malaysia. (c) 2016, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

This paper examines the relationship between board structure and risk taking behavior of emerging market firms by looking at firms' growth strategies in foreign as well as domestic markets. More specifically, we study the individual and joint effects of board structure, network centrality through board interlocks and ownership structure on firm's growth strategies. With the help of longitudinal data on 2152 publicly listed Indian firms from 2002 to 2009, we find that boards that are structured keeping in view the resource dependence role are more helpful in pursuing growth strategies. We find that firms having more independent board members and CEO duality are more likely to pursue growth through new domestic ventures or new foreign investments. Moreover, firms that are more central in the network of other firms, based on director interlocks, are more likely to pursue growth in domestic as well as international markets. Further we find that board independence interacts with network centrality and family ownership in affecting a firm's growth strategies. (c) 2017

Purpose: This study is guided by the upper echelon theory and argues that the role of females on boards of directors may differ between cultures. In a culture where the community has a significant humane orientation, female directors may pay much more attention to the social issues of corporate sustainability rather than environmental issues. Therefore, this study aims to differentiate between the social and environmental performances of companies to examine whether the presence of females on the boards of directors of Malaysian firms could affect social and environmental performances differently. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a sample of firms listed in Bursa Malaysia and develops two disclosure indices to measure social and environmental performances. Three proxies of female directors are used in the empirical models. The ordinary least square model is used to test the hypothesis. Findings: The empirical results suggest a positive association between social performance and the presence of female directors on the board of directors of Malaysian firms. However, no association was found between environmental performance and the presence of female directors on those boards. These results confirm the prediction of this study that the female directors of Malaysian firms pay more attention to social issues than to environmental ones. Originality/value: This is the first study to examine the effects of the presence of female directors on Malaysian firms' boards of directors on social and environmental performance. It also contributes to the upper echelon theory by illuminating the importance of gender diversity in influencing the social and environmental behaviors of corporate leaders. The results provide the important implication that the association between a firm's social and environmental performance and gender diversity depends on the culture within which the company operates.

Research summary: Does the degree to which founders keep control of their startups affect company value? I argue that founders face a "control dilemma" in which a startup's resource dependence drives a wedge between the startup's value and the founder's ability to retain control of decision making. I develop hypotheses about this tradeoff and test the hypotheses on a unique dataset of 6,130 American startups. I find that startups in which the founder is still in control of the board of directors and/or the CEO position are significantly less valuable than those in which the founder has given up control. On average, each additional level of founder control (i.e., controlling the board and/or the CEO position) reduces the pre-money valuation of the startup by 17.1-22.0 percent. Managerial summary: A founder's vision and capabilities are key ingredients in the early success of a startup. During those early days, it is natural for the founder to have a powerful, central role. However, as the startup grows, founders who keep too much control of the startup and its most important decisions can harm the value of the startup. Both qualitative case studies and quantitative analyses of more than 6,000 private companies highlight that startups in which the founder has maintained control (by retaining a majority of the board of directors and/or by remaining as CEO) have significantly lower valuations than those where the founder has relinquished control. This is especially true when the startup is three years old or more. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In the wake of the recent debt crisis in Europe, we investigate the influence of board diversity on financial fragility and performance of European banks. Corporate governance codes in Europe recommend unitary and dual-board systems; therefore, we believe that the influence of board diversity may vary across governance mechanisms and that no other studies have addressed these variations and their influence on financial fragility across European countries. The results show that a critical mass of female representation on both the supervisory board and the board of directors may reduce banks' vulnerability to financial crisis. However, interestingly, we find evidence that female directors on the management board are not risk averse. We argue that the degree of risk taking for female directors may vary based on their roles (non-executive or executive) and that female and male executive directors may have the same risk taking behaviour. Our empirical results provide guidelines to the regulators in Europe with respect to the recently approved proposal by the European Parliament on female representation. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This study aims to analyse the relationship between board gender diversity and firm financial performance in Italy, where the recently enforced Law 120/2011 prescribes gender quotas for boards of directors. Design/methodology/approach: Panel data analysis was used to examine the gender diversity-firm financial performance relationship in an unbalanced panel of 918 Italian listed companies during the years 2011-2014. Findings: Gender diversity, as measured by the percentage of women on a board and by the Blau and the Shannon indices, has a positive and significant effect on Tobin's Q, while the presence of one or more women on the board per se has an insignificant effect on firm financial performance. Practical implications: The results suggest that board gender diversity is not a simple "numbers game", greater gender diversity may generate economic gains, greater gender diversity does not destroy shareholder value, investors do not penalize companies that increase female representation on their boards and Italian companies should focus their efforts on the right mix of men and women rather than on simply the presence of at least one woman on a board of directors. Originality/value: Most articles on this topic use data from countries with a legal system based on common law; this paper analyses Italy, a country with a civil law system. This is almost certainly the first study to examine the effect of board gender diversity on firm financial performance in the Italian market. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper presents an empirical study of changes that firms implement in their board-level IT governance (ITG) upon experiencing operational IT failures. Consistent with the separation of oversight from management decisions, board-level ITG is responsible for monitoring managerial IT decisions and policies for controlling IT resources. We expect that operational IT failures indicating inadequacies in board monitoring of controls over IT resources would result in a negative stock market reaction and, in turn, induce firms to improve their board-level ITG. Our expectation is confirmed based on a sample of 110 operational IT failures from U.S. public financial firms. Specifically, our results demonstrate that subsequent to experiencing operational IT failures, firms make improvements to the IT competency level of their boards, and the improvements are proportional to the degree of negative market reaction. However, those improvements are only on the executive side of the board, namely: an increase in the IT experience of internal (executive) directors and an increased turnover rate of CIOs serving on the board. Furthermore, the likelihood of CIO turnover is lower in IT-intensive firms where such turnover could be more disruptive. Our results contribute to understanding the critical connection between operational IT failures and board-level ITG.

This study examines the impact of board of director gender diversity on corporate tax aggressiveness. Based on a sample of 418 U.S. firms covering the 2006-2009 period (1672 firm-year observations), our ordinary least squares regression results show a negative and statistically significant association between female representation on the board and tax aggressiveness after controlling for endogeneity. Our results are consistent across several measures of tax aggressiveness and additional robustness checks. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the joint effect of board independence and gender diversity on the effectiveness of boards in monitoring CEO compensation in a continental European context, i.e. France. Design/methodology/approach: Fixed-effect regressions are used to study the impact of board independence, gender diversity and their interaction, i.e. the proportion of female independent directors on the different components of CEO compensation (total, fixed and variable). Findings: The authors observe that both the proportions of independent directors and women sitting on the boards positively influence the various components of CEO compensation. However, the interaction of these factors, i.e. the proportion of female independent directors, is negatively associated with CEO compensation. These results suggest that independent women directors improve board effectiveness in monitoring CEO compensation, especially its fixed component. Originality/value: The results of this research help to elucidate the importance of women being appointed to boards as independent directors to properly monitor managerial pay. These results provide support to the approach of the French Cope-Zimmerman law of January 2011, which promotes female representation on boards as independent directors to enhance board decision-making. Thus, evidence presented and discussed in this paper should provide useful insights for academics, corporate managers and regulators. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Research summary: Corporate scandals of the previous decade have heightened attention on board independence. Indeed, boards at many large firms are now so independent that the CEO is "home alone" as the lone inside member. We build upon "pro-insider" research within agency theory to explain how the growing trend toward lone-insider boards affects key outcomes and how external governance forces constrain their impact. We find evidence among S&P 1500 firms that having a lone-insider board is associated with (a) excess CEO pay and a larger CEO-top management team pay gap, (b) increased likelihood of financial misconduct, and (c) decreased firm performance, but that stock analysts and institutional investors reduce these negative effects. The findings raise important questions about the efficacy of leaving the CEO "home alone.". Managerial summary: Following concerns that insider-dominated boards failed to protect shareholders, there has been a push for greater board independence. This push has been so successful that the CEO is now the only insider on the boards of more than half of S&P 1500 firms. We examine whether lone-insider boards do in fact offer strong governance or whether they enable CEOs to benefit personally. We find that lone-insider boards pay CEOs excessively, pay CEOs a disproportionately large amount relative to other top managers, have more instances of financial misconduct, and have lower performance than boards with more than one insider. Thus, it appears that lone-insider boards do not function as intended and firms should reconsider whether the push towards lone-insider boards is actually in shareholders' best interests.

Time plays an important role in corporate social responsibility (CSR) decisions. In the context of time and the boardroom, the consideration of CSR can be affected by board structure. For example, because of considerable short-term pressures, this study posits that insiders on the board are less likely to prioritize the longer-term time horizons needed to affect CSR. Following this perspective, a hypothesis is put forth that insiders generally have temporal orientations that are more short term in nature and that they therefore have a negative effect on CSR. A study of 300 of Australia's largest firms confirmed this hypothesis. However, when inside director compensation linked to environmental and social metrics and inside director CSR training are introduced as moderating variables, their interactive effects lead to positive results: both positively moderate the negative insider-CSR relationship in environmental and social dimensions. The study contributes to a temporal view of boards of directors, as well as to corporate governance and CSR. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

We examine the relation between boards of directors' knowledge heterogeneity and organizational ambidexterity (OA) (i.e. simultaneous exploration and exploitation) in knowledge-intensive firms (KIFs). Although the literature on OA has started to emphasize its antecedents, the role of the board remains unaddressed. This is an important omission, as boards have become increasingly involved in strategy-making. In turn, studies on boards have looked at their influence on either exploration- or exploitation-type strategies. Yet, KIFs particularly need to balance both exploration and exploitation to renew their knowledge base. We draw on knowledge-based perspectives to disentangle the benefits and costs of board knowledge heterogeneity for driving OA in KIFs. Our empirical analysis based on a longitudinal panel of UK pharmaceutical firms provides support for our hypothesized U-shaped relation. Our findings suggest that the benefits of knowledge heterogeneity only outweigh the costs beyond a particular threshold. Overall, our theoretical approach and allied findings advance the literature by introducing boundary conditions to the resource provision role of boards in KIFs. We discuss contributions for organizational learning, strategic leadership, and human resource management. We conclude with implications for theory and practice, as well as key opportunities for future research. (c) 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

In this empirical study, we investigate the variation in firms' response to institutional pressure for gender-balanced boards, focusing specifically on the preservation of prevailing practices of director selection and its impact on the representation of women on the board of directors. Using 8 years of data from publicly listed Nordic corporations, we show societal pressure to be one of the determinants of female directorship. Moreover, in some corporations, the director selection process may work to maintain "a traditional type of board". In such boards, demographic diversity among male members appears to be associated with a lower share of female directors, although we cannot establish wether this reflects discrimination or a desire to maintain critical competencies. With this paper we add to the theoretical understanding of the factors underlying female board appointments by adopting an institutional theory lens to study female board representation. Viewing the demands for gender-balanced boards in terms of societal pressure for the de-institutionalization of the prevailing norms and practices, we highlight preferences for maintaining established practices as a potentially important barrier to institutional change. On these grounds, we conjecture on the relationship between the gender diversity of boards and other diversity dimensions. We suggest that a board room gender quota (if implemented) is supplemented by policies to ensure the transparency of board changes, in order to prevent the crowding out of other diversity dimensions.

Boards of directors represent a central factor for firm success by performing different tasks such as control, networking, or advice. Stemming from socioemotional wealth (SEW) literature, the aim of this article is to investigate the board tasks-financial performance relationship, showing their different contributions in family and non-family firms when firm survival is at stake. The main hypotheses are tested through moderated linear regression analyses. The findings suggest that while advisory tasks generally enhance financial performance in family firms, especially during turmoil, networking and control tasks have a detrimental effect when these firms suffer internal financial crises. Hence, we contribute to the SEW paradigm by underlining that family firms seem to accept performance hazards in order to protect family discretion and a positive public reputation even when they suffer severe hardship. In contrast, board advice supports utilizing family firms' unique social capital and significantly bolsters financial performance, without disturbing the family and its SEW preservation needs.

While studies show that organizational diversity is beneficial to their practice of environmental sustainability, we know very little about the effect that the gender of an individual director can have on sustainability practice. In this empirical paper, we employ a micro-foundational approach to examine whether the number of women on an organization's board of directors has a direct effect on its attitude towards environmental sustainability, regardless of the national culture in which the organization is located. Culture in this study is measured through grammatical gender marking, a unique approach to measuring women-oriented cultural effects. Previous studies show that certain cultures have more gender roles than others do, which in turn affect general and organizational behavior in that society. Grammatical gender marking enables us to study the impact of gender of the individual director on the organization's attitude towards environmental sustainability across cultures, by empirically examining data from 71 countries, sampling 4500 organizations for multiple years and industries. Our findings show that organizations become significantly more proactive in environmental sustainability with the appointment of even one woman to the board of directors, regardless of the local culture. We further show that the organization's level of disclosure regarding its sustainability activities increases with the number of women on the board of directors. Our data also show a significantly negative relationship between various gender-based language indices and the presence of women on the board of directors. In cultures defined by a language that has clear grammatical gender markings, there is a tendency to appoint fewer women to boards of directors, thereby influencing indirectly the organization's attitude towards environmental sustainability.

This paper examines the role of the board of directors in influencing the value of Italian listed firms from 2003 to 2013. In particular, employing agency, stewardship and resource dependence theories, the study aims to compare board characteristics in family and non-family firms and define the theory that best applies to family firms. Empirical results show that the presence of CEO duality and busy directors has a positive effect on the value of family firms, while gender diversity has a negative impact on the value when a member of the family leads a family firm. Conversely, the size of the board positively affects the value of non-family firms. Our main findings suggest the prevalence, in family firms, of the benefits of the board structure argued by stewardship and resource dependence theories rather than the disadvantages expected from agency theory.

Governance scholars debate the value of directors as an effective governance mechanism. We suggest that this value varies with director tenure. We study both how shareholder assessments of the value of individual directors vary with director tenure and whether director tenure actually makes a practical difference to governance effectiveness. Using data from abnormal stock price reactions to the sudden deaths of 274 outside directors, and integrating executive cognition and social capital perspectives applied to the dual roles of director monitoring and advising, our results confirm a curvilinear relationship between the assessed value of directors and tenure. We find that directors are more highly valued by investors over a tenure period between 7 and 18 years, moderated by director involvement on key committees. Further, in examining the S & P 1,500, we find that a one standard deviation increase in the percentage of outside directors in this prime tenure period strengthens the CEO pay-performance linkage by 2.5%, suggesting that directors in this tenure period are more effective in aligning CEO and shareholder interests. Our results demonstrate that individual director tenure makes a difference in governance effectiveness, and shareholders accurately assess this difference. Additionally, our findings provide important boundary conditions for when theories of executive cognition and social capital may be more/less applicable regarding director tenure. (c) 2017 INFORMS.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between women in the board of directors, firm performance and corporate decisions as well as the risk of the firm, debt level, and research and development (R&D). Design/methodology/approach: This study investigates a sample of 41 Italian listed companies. In particular, using a panel data of 369 firm-year observations, during the period 2005-2013, through a generalized method of moment, the relationship between women in the board of directors and corporate decisions has been investigated. Findings: The results suggest that female representation in the board of directors affects corporate decisions. Women in the boardroom affect both financing and investment decisions. In particular, the presence of women seems to take on a complementary role to debt; it has a negative effect on risk and appears to have a positive impact on investment in R&D The results also suggest a strong relationship between female directors and firm value, especially when certain multicultural factors are considered. Finally, considering the concept of "critical mass," in line with the arguments of Kanter (1977), the results seem to emphasize a greater influence of women with respect to corporate decisions, moving from "tokenism" to a "critical mass" scenario. Practical implications: The outcomes of the application, besides improving the current knowledge on the relationship between female representation in the board of directors, innovation, financial, and accounting decisions, intend to reveal if the governance of Italian listed companies is efficient in determining company results and in pursuing optimal decisions. Moreover, the results could be useful for both policy makers for the regulation of corporate governance and the board of directors and as a suggestion to companies that regularly appoint the members of the board of directors. Originality/value: The work is not limited to examining the relationship between female representation and the performance of firms but instead uses a series of indicators of corporate decisions and multicultural, such as, the nationality of women in board of directors, the educational level, the past experience, and their interaction with the variables concerning the decision-making process. To the best knowledge of authors, this is the first study that investigates the relationship between women and corporate decisions in a single civil law country.

Taking a combination between agency theory and resource dependence theory, we point out that directors' capital may have an effect on R&D strategies. A sample of both high-tech and low-tech industries for the period 2007-2011 is used. The results indicate that, regardless of the type of industry and the specific expertise on R&D intensive companies, board members with multiple directorships influence R&D corporate strategies. The resources acquired by directors through their experience and connections positively influence R&D intensity, but only if directors can carry out their monitoring activity adequately. This evidence implies a step forward in the understanding of the role of board of directors in corporate strategy, thus having significant implications for academics, companies and regulators, which are both theoretical and practical.

More and more boards are tapping interim CEOs to temporarily fill the corner office. Prior research indicates the negative performance implications of this decision; yet, little is known about the rationale behind this decision. Our aim is to fill this research gap. Drawing on agency and human capabilities frameworks, we examined the contextual elements that influence a board's decision to pursue temporary leadership. Within a sample of 375 successions occurring between 1998 and 2005, we found that boards of directors were more likely to select interim CEOs under certain succession conditions, namely, when the prior CEO was forced out and there was no heir apparent or when the prior CEO had served for a short tenure. Our results highlight the importance of context in succession selections and provide insights into why a board would pursue a decision with seemingly negative repercussions. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

In this paper we address how director expertise impacts a director's social status and conformity within the board. Our results, derived from two unique multi-source datasets of peer ratings on director status and conformity of non-executive directors from Dutch organizations, indicate that industry-specific expertise and financial expertise differently impact directors' social status and influence within the board. We find that directors' individual performance orientation - the motivation to demonstrate expertise - acts as an important contingency for expertise to increase directors' status within the board. Additional analyses using archival data and interviews with non-executive directors substantiate our findings and provide additional insight into the dynamics operating within boards. This study extends existing research on boards of directors and provides unique micro-level insights into the boardroom dynamics that connect director expertise to director status and conformity within boards.

Research summary: Venture boards are theoretically important and economically relevant. They are at the apex of a venture's organizational hierarchy and have significant influence on the most important decisions related to venture strategy and personnel. This article reviews the organizational and strategy research on venture boards, clarifying how venture boards differ from venture investors and from public firm boards. It lays out a systematic research agenda to stimulate more research on venture governance, including venture board composition and structure, venture board processes, and venture board transitions to public firm boards. This agenda attempts to illuminate the research opportunities related to the distinctive nature of venture boards and enable theoretical engagement with the broader corporate governance scholarship on public firms. Managerial summary: A venture's board of directors is highly consequential for its most important strategic and personnel outcomes. Uber and Theranos are just two recent ventures whose boards have come under public spotlight. This article reviews organizational and strategy research on venture boards, mapping the evolution of the academic literature, summarizing key findings, and identifying the most important limitations. It explains how venture boards are different from venture investors and from public firm boards. Importantly, it lays out a systematic research agenda that draws upon the distinctive nature of venture boards and also creates a bridge to the broader literature on public firm boards. New insights on venture board composition, structure, process, and transition to public firm boards will be relevant to venture executives, investors, and directors.

Previous studies have established that firms' effectiveness can differ based on the differences among directors within a board, and between boards. However, studies have yet to establish the effectiveness of the diverse attributes of the board on firms' quality of earnings in an emerging market setting such as Vietnam. This study investigates the effect of board diversity on earnings quality in a sample of Vietnamese listed firms. The two dimensions of board diversity measures in this study cover a wide range of structural and demographic attributes of board of directors, using a diversity-of-boards index (dissimilarities among firm boards, i.e., board structure) and a diversity-in-boards index (dissimilarities among directors within a board, i.e., demographic attributes of board members). Earnings quality is an aggregate measure compiled from four accounting-based measures of earnings quality: accruals quality, earnings persistence, earnings predictability and earnings smoothness. We find a significant, positive linear relationship between diversity of boards and earnings quality, while the relationship between diversity in boards and earnings quality is non-linear, with a U-shaped curve.

The board of directors is legally responsible for setting the strategic direction of the firm and for ensuring the firm's long-term performance in almost all governance environments. However, many boards delegate part or all of the task of creating and executing the firm's strategy to a group of full-time professional managers. This separation between ownership and control creates many challenges for the modern-day firm, and the board's role in the strategy formation process is arguably the seminal governance challenge confronting boards today. This study examines this seminal challenge by: (1) Introducing background information on this stream by defining key terms and discussing its importance to the wider corporate governance literature, describing three infamous case studies of firms based in the USA, Europe and Asia where the board was insufficiently involved, and noting situations where the board may become too involved; (2) Exploring previous reviews of this research stream on board strategic involvement, and discussing the evolution of this construct and related studies over time; (3) Analyzing previous research designs used in this research stream while identifying the frequency as well as costs and benefits associated with each; (4) Summarizing what we currently know about the multi-level antecedents of board involvement within single countries; (5) Specifying some of the national-level antecedents of board involvement identified in cross-national studies; (6) Identifying the subsequent multi-level effects of board involvement; and (7) Discussing the implications of this review and outlining future research directions.

The language that signals conformity to a prevailing norm can contribute to the appearance of managerial competency and organizational legitimacy. We argue that top corporate managers' use of language that is congruent with a prevailing norm leads the boards of directors to evaluate the managers more favourably and to grant a higher level of compensation. We test this argument by analysing the letters to shareholders from 334 US firms and examine the CEOs' expression of the shareholder value principle, which is a prevailing model of corporate governance in the USA. We found that the use of shareholder-value language is significantly related to a higher level of CEO compensation and that the effect of shareholder-value language is greater when shareholder activism is stronger.

The study examines the effect of female directors on firm performance for Indian firms, where the domination of family firms and a patriarchal society may reduce the importance of female directors. Our empirical results suggest that the gender diversity does not matter for Indian firms. Our further results support this finding by indicating that female directors face more attendance problems compared to male directors, and are less likely to be appointed in monitoring-related committees. Overall, our results strengthen the tokenism status theory associated with female directors, especially in family-owned firms and in a patriarchal society. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the impact of board characteristics on the amount of capital raised through an IPO for a sample of 220 Malaysian IPOs over the period of 2005-2015, applying both ordinary least squares (OLS) and quantile regression (QR) techniques. The OLS results show that board with ethnic Malay directors has a significant and positive association with the amount of capital raised, while a weak significance is found for board size. However, the QR results reveal that other than board ethnicity, other board characteristics namely board size, board independence and CEO duality are significantly associated with the amount of capital raised. The additional results suggest that QR provides a more insightful and full picture into the association than does OLS. The overall empirical evidence lends support to the resource dependence role of the board of directors at the time of an IPO. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: Corporate accountability is a complex chain of reporting that reaches from external stakeholders into the organization's management structure. The transition from external to internal accountability mechanisms primarily occurs at the board of directors. Yet outside of incentive mechanisms, we know surprisingly little about how internal actors (management) are held to account by the representatives of external shareholders (the board). The purpose of this paper is to explore the process of accountability at this transition point by documenting the routines used by boards to hold the firm's management to account. In doing so, we develop the understanding of the important transition between internal and external firm accountability. Design/methodology/approach: An inductive, case-based approach identifies recurrent behaviour patterns in two matched boards over three video-taped meetings. Sequential analysis of coded group and individual behaviours provides insight into boards' accountability routines. Findings: The boards engaged in clear, recurrent accountability routines. Individuals on the boards play different roles in these routines depending on the issue before the board, allowing both directors and managers to hold each other to account. The outsiders (directors) both challenge and support the insiders (managers) during board discussions, switching their behaviours with different agenda items but maintaining a consistent group level of support and scepticism across the meeting. This allows for the simultaneous development of trust and verification at the group level, a necessary condition for effective accountability. Research limitations/implications: As board relationships and organisational context are highly variable, future research should concentrate on testing the generalizability of the results across different board and shareholder structures. Practical implications: The results call into question the current governance focus on the independence of the individual director, as the authors identify that all directors appear to act as agents at one time or another in a meeting. Accountability at the boardroom level requires an effective group process not usually addressed in governance recommendations or regulation. Originality/value: This study provides unique insights into board dynamics, documenting the accountability implications of group behaviours. By focussing on the group process, the authors highlight the potential mismatch of monotonic, individual-level approaches to governance and accountability prevalent in current agency approaches.

Purpose: Presently, one of the major governance issues faced by management and shareholders of organizations is the gender composition of the boards of directors and audit committees. This study aims to examine the impact of gender diversity in audit committees on the accuracy of management earnings forecasts disclosure in initial public offering (IPO) prospectuses. Design/methodology/approach: The study sample comprises 190 Malaysian companies issuing IPOs that transformed into public companies during the period 2002-2012. Earnings forecasts accuracy (quality) is proxied by absolute forecast error and the study model is developed based on the frameworks of the signalling theory, the agency theory and the resource-dependence theory. Findings: The study proposes that female directors introduce a set of specific features in the boardroom that serve to improve investor protection and efficient monitoring of management. However, findings reveal an insignificantly positive relationship between gender diversity in audit committees and absolute forecast error, which shows that more female directors in audit committees could translate into more errors and less accuracy in earnings forecasts. Practical implications: Considering the recent regulatory developments that encourage the number of women on the board of directors, the findings obtained have significant implications for policymakers. The study findings can also be invaluable to investors, investment analysts, market players and researchers. Originality/value: The composition of the board of directors and audit committees in terms of gender plays a significant role in the promotion of effective corporate governance practices. This study is one of the pioneering studies that examines the advantages of gender diversity in the board of directors. It is also the first study to extend IPO literature by investigating the role of gender diversity in audit committees in the enhancement of accurate management earnings forecasts included in the IPO prospectuses.

Leadership, governance and performance in family businesses are broadly studied, but results are contradictory. There is a need for deeper understanding of these relationships since emotional and behavioral aspects are complex in these types businesses. Questions on the how and the why of board functioning and ownership, and their influences on performance are scarce, given lack of data or a focus on quantitative data. To find a balance between qualitative and quantitative methods, we explore fuzzy sets logic as a methodology to expand knowledge in family businesses and present an application to build a representation of entrepreneurial performance results based on board of directors' composition and CEO's ownership, using case studies. Results indicate that the methodology offers alternative explanations to governance, leadership and performance dimensions in these businesses. Using fuzzy sets logic, we find that entrepreneurial performance is higher when outsiders' membership in boards of directors and CEO ownership are both high as well.

Purpose: Using a contingency approach, the purpose of this paper is to study how organizational factors (such as the organizational life cycle, firm size, firm ownership concentration and firm technology) determine the relative importance of the monitoring and provision of resources roles provided by board members. Design/methodology/approach: This paper highlights the importance of contingency factors in carrying out board's roles using a sample of 579 European firms registered in the STOXX Europe 600 index. The authors used a longitudinal analysis for the period from 2002 through to 2011. Findings: The results show that the monitoring role is more relevant for companies that are large, are operating at the mature and stagnant stages, have a dispersed ownership and are low-technology. However, the provision of resources role is more relevant for companies that are in the growth and stagnant stages, and have a concentrated ownership. Originality/value: The traditional analysis that relates the board's structure and composition to the board's roles focuses on determining what board should be the best. It plays little attention to analyzing which organizational factors affect the importance and presence of monitoring or resource dependence roles. In this regard, this work adds significant insights to agency theory and resource dependence theory as, with a contingency framework, the research aims to find what functions the board needs to develop in order to get better firm performance.

The aim of this article is to shed new light on the antecedent of board composition in family firms. By integrating socioemotional wealth and stewardship theory, we hypothesise that family-oriented objectives not only affect the traditional dichotomous classification (family vs. non-family board members) but also the inner composition among family board members (e.g., family board members working in the firm vs. family board members not working in the firm). Our main findings suggest that the stronger the importance of family-oriented objectives, the greater the presence of family members on boards of directors. Furthermore, for high levels of family-oriented objectives, where steward-oriented behaviours prevail, the sub-group of family board members on the board will be mainly composed of family board members working in the firm.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether companies with female executives and directors are less likely to be involved in financial reporting fraud litigation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors build a data set comprised of companies from the Stanford Securities Class Action Clearinghouse database that were involved in fraud litigation along with a control set of companies listed on the Compustat database for the time period 2007-2013. The authors use a logistic regression model to determine the likelihood of fraud when there is at least one woman in an executive position or on the board of directors. Findings: The authors find that the presence of at least one female leader decreases the likelihood that the company will be involved in litigation for financial reporting fraud. The results are robust after controlling for sample selection bias by using a propensity score matched sample. Practical implications: The findings add to the literature which indicates that women tend to be more risk averse and are more committed to ethics policies. The study also supports previous research that indicates large firms with inflated market value are more likely to be subject to fraud litigation. Originality/value: The study combines the literature on the characteristics of women in leadership positions with the study of fraud litigation. The authors find evidence that the presence of either female executives or female directors lowers financial reporting fraud risk. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

When making investment decisions, many investors now regularly consider a company's CSR activities along with traditional financial performance measures (Elliott et al., 2014). Our study considers whether shareholders may also consider CSR activities when voting in director elections and say-on-pay votes. We find that CSR performance is associated with shareholder support in both director elections and say-on-pay votes. In particular, we find higher support for both director elections and executive compensation when there are more CSR strengths. Additionally, we find that the social strength aspect of CSR is the most important component in the relationships between CSR and director elections and that the environmental strengths aspect is the most important component in the relationship between CSR and executive compensation. Our results suggest that shareholders may value certain types of CSR and are more supportive of boards and management when CSR performance is stronger. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd

The impact of female directors on firm performance has lacked consistency in the previously conducted empirical studies, which may be due to the endogeneity problem, or certain characteristics (i.e. governance, industry, competition). This study examines the relationship between female directors and firm performance by addressing those problems. This study analyses all non-financial UK listed firms during the period 2004-2012 and employs several econometric models. The regression results indicate that there is little evidence that female directors have a positive and strong relationship with firm performance. But, further analysis reports that the UK's small listed firms experience a positive significant effect, because small firms do not suffer from the problem of over-monitoring and they have more flexibility in composing their boards of directors.

This study applies a new multi-focal actor-centered institution-theoretic approach to examine the association between executive pay and the recruitment of social elites to the board of directors in developing countries. We use a sample of 119 initial public offerings (IPOs) from 17 African stock markets to model this relationship. The results suggest that a higher proportion of elites on the board is associated with lower executive pay. This is moderated by institutional quality; that is, lower institutional quality is associated with more directors drawn from social elites and with higher pay, while the opposite is true in higher-institutional-quality environments. Our findings confirm the importance of the social environment within which governance is embedded. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of the study is to examine the effect of diversity in the board of directors on the performance of the listed Italian financial institutions. The sample is a data set of 177 firm-year observations covering 2011 to 2014. The performance of the firm is measured by Tobin's Q while board diversity is analysed considering the percentage of female and foreign directors on the board (or their conjoint presence as a proxy of overall demographic diversity) and task-diversity is measured by board interlocking directorship and busy directors. Findings suggest that female directors have no effect on firm performance. Foreign directors and interlocking directorship have, instead, a positive statistically significant relationship with performance while we find a negative statistically significant relationship between busy directors and performance. When we consider the overall demographic diversity on the board we observe that it is positively and significantly related to the performance of the financial firm.

This study examines how behavioral processes among nominating committees, CEOs, and board chairs affect the comprehensiveness of non-executive director selection planning and evaluation. Building on a theory-building multiple-case study, our findings indicate that comprehensiveness is based on three key factors: (1) task-related mutual and collective interactions in nominating committees, (2) board chair leadership in structuring selection processes with high facilitation skills, and (3) the level and timing of information exchange between CEOs and board chairs. Furthermore, we highlight the interconnectedness and temporal embeddedness of these behavioral processes. Our study contributes to a more holistic understanding of non-executive director selections and provides new insights into the complex and interwoven social dynamics among nominating committees, CEOs, and board chairs.

While directors' task boundaries are usually ambiguous, some of their activities or behaviors clearly constitute their formal duties, whereas others are usually perceived as organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Applying identity theory, we present a theoretical model that demonstrates one of the key drivers for directors to engage in OCB with a focus on their role identity. We argue that an individual director's role identity is one of the key factors that motivate directors to engage in OCB. Furthermore, we propose that two board-level contingencies, board capital, and informal board hierarchy order, can moderate the effect of directors' role-identity salience on their OCB. That is, low levels of board capital and directors' higher positions in a board's informal hierarchy enhance directors' motivation to engage in OCB.

The increasing emphasis on social responsibility across the world is not new (Warhurst, 2005) and many countries require companies to disclose information about their environmental, social and employee-related impact, as well as their diversity policy (The Hauser Institute, 2015). India took CSR to the next level by mandating it for all companies through the recently introduced Section 135 in the Companies Act (2013). The provisions of the section require companies to establish a CSR committee consisting of three members of the Board of Directors to develop a CSR policy and review the CSR activities and prepare periodic reports. The above mentioned CSR infrastructure therefore necessitates significant capacity building within companies. With respect to implementation, companies may channel their resources through qualified nongovernmental organisations (NGOs). Consequently NGOs will also require significant capacity building. In this paper we identify the implications of the new guidelines that are worthy of consideration; these implications are for companies that meet the criteria to and therefore must comply with the provisions contained in Section 135, the organisations (including NGOs) that will implement the activities and other general implications. Furthermore the paper suggests mechanisms by which several of these challenges can be met and managed. Copyright (c) 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

In this study, a cross-theoretical hybridization between diversity archetypes and the behavioural theory of corporate governance is proposed. Within an integrative theoretical framework, I discuss three variants of the board's social setting: diversity as variety; separation; and disparity. Their influence on the mechanisms of the socially-situated and socially-constituted agency, and in consequence the socially-constructed boardroom reality, is considered. The model stipulates what kind of impact individual agency perception, associated with each diversity archetype, can be expected to have on board task effectiveness (monitoring/control, resource-provision, and strategy-making/consulting). There are altogether six theoretical propositions made in this paper. The study represents an application of the behavioural theory of corporate governance in the theory-building paper. I utilise the notion of diversity and the theory of subgroups from existing group effectiveness literature. The proposed theoretical framework strongly benefits from recent taxonomically-systematizing efforts in the area of diversity research. The proposed model also allows for due consideration of behavioural patterns in the boardroom. This framework scores high on its generalisability to a wider population and realism of context, but low on its precision of measurement. A discussion of the model's limitations unfolds in the wider context of the challenges and paradoxes/conundrums with which the community of corporate governance scholars is invariably confronted. The model suffers from a limited translatability of findings into actionable managerial implications and recommendations of the regulator, as expressed in corporate governance codes.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the link between board of director composition and firm performance. Specifically, the paper argues that board political experience influences the firm's internationalization strategy as directors with significant political experience provide guidance, resources, and network access that enhance the firm's international presence. The authors also posit that board political connections would be more helpful for firms operating in high-regulation industries. Design/methodology/approach: The authors tested the predictions using data from 156 large US firms. Data on directors' background were gathered from SEC proxy filings, while data pertaining to internationalization were obtained from Compustat and Mergent Online databases. Hierarchical moderated regression analysis was employed to empirically test the hypothesized relationships. Findings: The findings provide strong support for the positive relationship between board political experience and the degree of firm internationalization. Contrary to the authors' predictions, the level of industry regulation does not seem to significantly affect this relationship. Research limitations/implications: Firms aggressively pursuing international strategy could benefit from having directors on their board with robust political experience. One of the limitations of the study is that the types of international activities for firms is not specified in the study as it might be in the form of joint-venture capacity, strategic alliances or for firms that might be born-global.

The findings suggest that having directors' with political experience is an important asset in influencing firm's corporate strategy. (c) 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Objectives Even though management talent is not, or should not be, a gender-related question, the smaller representation that women have in the executive governing bodies of companies is a well-known fact. Achieving adequate gender diversity on corporate boards does not only constitute a challenge on a level of ethics, policy and corporate social responsibility, it can also be an objective of efficiency, the veracity of which should be examined. Starting from this point of view, the aim of this work is to analyze if an increase in the feminine presence in the Boards of Management of companies leads to an improvement of its economic profitability (measured by the Rentability over Assets -RoA-). Specifically, for this research, we have opted for a sectoral analysis of credit cooperatives, which have been expressly elected for being non-listed financial entities, as well as being very homogeneous in their business model, both for its territorial nature and for the retail banking model implemented. Aditionally these entities incorporate the cooperative principles as a differentiating element of its corporate culture. The intention is nor to analyze the possible barriers that currently exist for the promotion of women to managerial positions, since they have already been included in several studies that analyze this issue, including the case of Spain (Ribas and Sajardo, 2005; Mateos et. al., 2010; Esteban, 2013). On the contrary, we want to know to which extent gender diversity affects the performance of credit unions both as companies and as financial institutions. Methodological approach The methodology that has been applied is based on the Generalized Method of Moments (MGM), used for the estimation of a dynamic linear equation with a panel composed of 78 entities during the period 2000-2014. This has been using the best source of public data of the sector, the Spanish Association of Credit Unions (UNACC). The dependent variable in the model is the economic profitability or rentability over assets (RoA), being the independent variables two measures of gender (proportion of female counselors and gender diversity on boards) and several main indicators of the economic and financial structure of the entities (efficiency, financial profitability, leverage, financial gap and solvency). Firstly, to run the analysis, the independent variables have been included on an individual basis, and then the impact of those related to gender through their interaction with the remaining independent variables, differentiating in both cases the effect according to the economic cycle. Results/Implications/Limitations The results obtained show the low female presence in the councils of the credit unions, since, on average, the proportion of female counselors reaches only 7.7% of the total membership, all of which explains the low value of the average Arithmetic of the Blau index (0,12), since these are not diversified Councils. Therefore, these results confirm that Spanish credit cooperatives have a gender gap even greater than the listed companies, both from Spain (13% in 2014) and from Europe (21% in 2015), according to the Spencer Stuart Board of Directors' Index (2015) and the European Commission (2016), respectively, which may be explained by the lack of regulation on mandatory gender quotas in their Boards. The results also indicate that the existence of a greater proportion of women on the boards of these entities contributed positively to improving their rentability over assets (RoA) through increased rentability over equity (RoE) and financial leverage. However, during the period of economic crisis (from 2008 to 2014) for each percentage point that the proportion of women in the council increased, the rentability over assets (RoA) was reduced by 2.39%, the rest of the variables remaining constant. The analysis of the research hypotheses allows us to observe, firstly, that the gender diversity in the Boards of Directors of the credit cooperatives analyzed is an important element to be taken into account in explaining the evolution of their rentability over assets (RoA), as well as through other economic- financial magnitudes, such as financial profitability, leverage or efficiency (H1 hypothesis). Secondly, the results obtained show that the effect of gender on the rentability over assets (RoA) has been subordinated to the existing economic cycle, since a negative impact is shown directly from 2008 onwards. Indirectly, through financial profitability and efficiency, the role of women has gone from being positive to zero or negative after the beginning of the crisis, depending on the proportion of women or gender diversity, respectively, as well as through the financial gap, therefore the negative effect (H2 hypothesis) becomes more intense. Conclusions/Findings As a main conclusion, it is possible to emphasize that the economic crisis has conditioned both the direct impact of the analyzed variables and the indirect one of gender in profitability. Thus, when we analyze the direct effect of women on the rentability over assets (RoA), we can see that the relationship between women and men is null or negative depending on the economic cycle, while the impact is both positive and negative, depending on the indirect approach used. This study has tried to fill a gap in the literature that analyzes the effect of gender on business profitability, such as the analysis in a sector of unlisted companies and for a broad period of time, which allows to contemplate different scenarios according to the economic cycle. In order to do this, a dynamic linear equation has been estimated by working with a panel of 78 Spanish cooperative credit institutions during the period 2000-2014 using the MGM. By doing this, it has been possible to measure both the direct impact of the proportion of women counselors and gender heterogeneity in the rentability over assets (RoA), as well as the consequences of the interaction with other variables, differentiating in both cases, whether this effect has been conditioned to the financial crisis in Spain (2008-2014). A further improvement of this research could be a qualitative aspect of a more difficult measurement that can be approached with a different methodology, analyzing the capacity of influence on the decisions that each woman can have on the rest of the members of the board in relation with deliberations and decision-making. This problem statement would mean focusing in the analysis of female leadership that can help understand the results obtained in this work, since the numerical increase in the number of women in boards cannot provide differentiation if they do not exercise the appropriate leadership in boards, that are generally composed of an average of 10 to 12 members. This study has been conditioned by a series of limitations, among which, fundamentally, are the non-possession and inclusion of data and valuations on certain characteristics that can be conditioned to the effect of gender on business performance, such as the characteristics of governance and the type of tasks performed by women on the boards. From another point of view, due to the fact that credit unions have a social purpose, it should be of interest to analyze other aspects of governance that allow studying not only the impact of women on the economic profitability of this entities, but also the possible effect that they may have in their social profitability, all of which stands as future lines of research.

A board of directors consists of a set of key personnel that hold vital positions in a company. Based on the premise of the resource dependence theory, we explore the association between board diversity and innovation performance in Malaysia. The sample consists of 220 companies from the industrial product sector of the main market of Bursa Malaysia for the financial year 2013. Board diversity is represented by a comprehensive score that includes age, gender, ethnicity, nationality, education, tenure, area of experience and directorship in other companies. Results of the regression analysis show that there is a positive association between board diversity and innovation performance. Our findings contribute to the policy involving the diversity of corporate boards by suggesting that policy, such as one of gender diversity in Malaysia, is expanded to include multi-dimensional aspects of board diversity that better represent the economic, legal and cultural environment of a country.

Purpose: The authors contend that immediately following the initial public offering (IPO), the new owners that replace the original ones are likely to request changes in two corporate governance mechanisms, board of directors and top management teams (TMTs). Following these alterations, the purpose of this paper is to propose that such changes will be detrimental for the performance of young entrepreneurial firms. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the post-IPO governance changes in young entrepreneurial firms. The sample consists of 185 companies that went public between 2001 and 2005. A hierarchical linear regression approach with the appropriate control variables is adopted to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The results revealed that, following the changes in ownership structure post-IPO, changes are observed in one of the corporate governance mechanisms the authors considered, boards of directors, but not TMTs. Consistent with the general theme of this study, the authors also observed a negative impact of changes in boards of directors on subsequent firm performance; this was not the case with TMTs. Research limitations/implications: Contrary to the fundamental contentions of agency theory, the results highlight the need for adopting a different approach for young entrepreneurial firms. Practical implications: The findings highlight the importance of preserving the entrepreneurial efficacy of young entrepreneurial firms. Originality/value: This paper challenges the fundamental contentions of agency theory in the case of young entrepreneurial firms. The results demonstrate that post-IPO shareholders' interference with the governance mechanisms results in lower performance. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to identify distinct motivation profiles among non-executive directors and explores the reasons why non-executive directors continue to serve on boards of directors. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is based on a multiple case study in the context of German supervisory boards. The authors develop their primary insights from semi-structured interviews with 53 non-executive directors. Findings: The findings indicate that non-executive director motivation revolves around material incentives, reputation, meaningfulness, congruence with firm goals and enjoyment. Three distinct motivation profiles emerge from the analysis, with each profile exhibiting a set of unique reasons to continue serving on boards. Research limitations/implications: Future research needs to test for the statistical representativeness of the findings and their performance implications, preferably in a shareholder-oriented governance context. Originality/value: The study introduces a psychological angle to the debate about non-executive director motivation. The contributions include going beyond a bi-polar distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and draw attention to how motivation profiles relate to non-executive director's intention to continue serving on boards.

The research question of this research work is whether women and men of German supervisory boards differ in their human capital and therefore gender diversity contributes to diversity in knowledge and skills. The curricula vitae of 264 female and male members of the boards were compared. We find empirical evidence that women and men differ in the following dimensions: number of degrees, kind and level of education, length and kind of professional experience, number of board seats, external versus internal appointment, internationality and number of children. No differences could be found regarding family affiliation. Therefore, we conclude that women in the board broaden the resource portfolio of knowledge and skill in supervisory boards. This result represents an important contribution to the corporate governance research. Further, the study contributes to the human capital theory by analyzing criteria that have been neglected so far. The study provides the basis for solid discussions about women in top management positions. (c) 2017, Schmalenbach-Gesellschaft fur Betriebswirtschaft e.V.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse the impact of company performance, governance structure and ownership structure in determining the managerial remuneration for 134 listed companies in India over the years 2003-2012. Design/methodology/approach - Remuneration paid to the board of directors of companies is taken to represent the managerial remuneration. Exogeneity among the company performance measures is verified with the endogtest suggested in Baum et al. (2007). A fixed effects panel regression with clustered standard errors is employed after checking for the presence of heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation and cross-sectional dependence in the data. Findings - The study reveals that managerial remuneration increases as the accounting performance of companies improves, whereas the market performance of companies has no significant association with managerial remuneration. The study also shows that foreign institutional shareholding is significantly and positively related with managerial remuneration in India. Research limitations/implications - This study highlights the various factors which affect the determination of managerial remuneration in India. These findings can be used as inputs by regulatory authorities in framing and improving governance norms regarding managerial remuneration. This study also suggests that factors other than the number, the independence and objectivity of independent directors are more important in determining managerial remuneration. Originality/value - The present study proposes more reliable results, obtained through a fixed effects panel regression model with clustered standard error estimates and also checks endogeneity of performance measures with the endogtest, which is the appropriate test to use for verifying endogeneity in panel data.

Purpose: This paper aims to show the importance of introducing an integration manager (i.e. an executive position used to channel the acquiring firm's course of action and strengthen the success of a post-acquisition integration process) within the acquiring firm's board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: This is a theoretical paper that introduces the integration manager within the board of privately held firms going internationally via acquisitions and serving as an "out-insider" director able to balance the conflicting demands of the previously separated entities during their integration process. The authors present an explanatory case study that empirically contributes to the board of directors' design for internationalization. Findings: The authors posit that the integration manager serves as an "out-insider" director of the board for privately held firms, possessed by large-block shareholders, going internationally via acquisitions, providing the necessary expertise and knowledge of the target firm's products and industry. Originality/value: The provided study aims to show that international acquisitions, even though apparently less risky than greenfield investments, may require additional neutral information flow - both within the due-diligence process and the post-acquisition integration - that only outsiders possess. Such an outsider has been individuated in the integration manager whose crucial role focuses on smoothing the pre- and post-acquisition integration processes.

This study examined the influence of gender diversity among company boards of directors and managerial ownership on corporate risk-taking. The sample was manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange from 2010 to 2013 selected using the purposive sampling method. Data was examined using multiple regression methods. The results showed that gender diversity on a board of directors (BOD) and managerial ownership have no significant effect on corporate risk-taking. This is likely due to the relatively low percentage of both variables in Indonesia, thus, they do not tend to affect corporate risk-taking decisions. The study recommends increasing gender diversity and managerial ownership in the corporate risk-taking process towards sustainable business practices. (c) Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

In this paper we develop a model for researching the influence that a board of directors can have on improving an organization's sustainability performance. Our model explores sources of cognitive flexibility of boards needed to recognize and respond to the need for improved sustainability performance. We first define concepts of sustainability, sustainability competence, and sustainability performance. We then analyze two forms of board capital (a board's human capital and its social capital) and three aspects of a board's information processing (its patterns of information search, discussion and debate, and information absorption) that we suggest affect a board's cognitive flexibility and thereby influence whether a board decides to adopt sustainability performance goals. Our model also suggests that an organization's strategic flexibility - as represented by its current endowments of resource flexibilities and coordination flexibilities - will moderate the relationship between a board's decision to adopt sustainability performance goals and an organization's subsequent achievement of those goals. We also suggest that our model is generally relevant to any research seeking to predict the influence of boards on strategic change in many forms, not just to research focused on sustainability issues.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between board dependence, antitakeover provisions and their influence on corporate entrepreneurship (CE). Design/methodology/approach: The study uses agency theory as a framework to expand on the board dependence-CE relationship by injecting the moderating role of antitakeover provisions to the model. Using data collected from 350 publicly traded firms, a panel regression analyses was conducted on both innovation and venturing components of CE. Findings: The findings of this study show a negative relationship between board dependence and CE. Further this study shows that such a negative relationship becomes weaker when higher levels of antitakeover provisions are injected into the model. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted using a sample of large publicly traded firms within the information and manufacturing sectors, and so our findings may not be generalizable to firms in other contexts. Further, other variables representing CE (e.g. new product introductions) may add to this line of research in the future. Practical implications: Understanding the role of board of directors within a firm may help foster CE throughout the organization. Originality/value: This study expands on existing research by incorporating the influence of environmental factors (e.g. antitakeover provisions) and examining the relationship between corporate governance and CE using both measures of innovation and venturing.

The main aim of the present study is to determine the role of environmentally expert and experience leader on positive deviance behaviour in corporate environmental reporting practices. Based on the environmental reporting index develop based on the concept of positive environmental deviance, the study measured positive deviance behaviour in environmental reporting practices of 209 Malaysian public listed companies based on 5 years panel data. It was found that environmental expert and experience board of directors have a positive significant relationship with positive deviance in environmental reporting practices. Nevertheless it have been found that there were no significant relationship between environmentally expert and experience CEO and its interaction effect with environmentally expert and experience board of directors on positive deviance behaviour in environmentally reporting practices. This study conceptualized positive deviance behaviour in environmental reporting practices as the strategic behaviour of the corporations to improve the impact of environmental sustainability practices beyond the required regulations by disclosing set of information regarding to their proactive management practices and performance which: (1) exceed minimal norms; (2) deviate from others within the field; (3) go beyond what is required by regulation; and (4) associated broader scale changes.

Drawing on stewardship and resource dependence theories, we examine how the board of directors (BoD) influences the link between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and ambidextrous innovation in small and medium sized family firms (family SMEs). Our analysis of 230 Spanish family SMEs shows that family involvement in the BoD has a negative effect on their ability to turn EO into innovation. Moreover, we show that the BoD's strategic involvement in service and control tasks and the provision of knowledge and skills have positive effects, whereas the intensity of BoD activity has a surprisingly negative effect. These findings underscore that the effects of the BoD on the entrepreneurship-innovation link are more complex than previously thought, pointing to the important role of both BoD composition and BoD functioning for enabling innovation in family SMEs.

This study develops a combined agency-resource dependence perspective and applies it to the study of interlocking directorates. It suggests that interlocking directorates may exert either a positive or a negative effect on subsequent firm performance, depending on the firm's relative resources, power imbalance, ownership concentration, and CEO ownership. A test on a sample of 145 Italian companies provides support for hypothesized effects. This study suggests that integrating agency and resource dependence theories provides a higher-order explanation of firm performance and helps advance both agency and resource dependence theories.

We investigate the influence of the dual board structure on the financial performance of Islamic banks. The paper also investigates the unique agency relationships using a sample of 90 Islamic banks across 13 countries over the period 2006-2014. We find that the larger the Shari'ah Supervisory Board (SSB) the better the financial performance and this result reinforces the fundamental role of the SSB to certify permissible financial instruments and products. We also find evidence of the scope of operation hypothesis with respect to both the board of directors and the SSB as Islamic banks are characterised by a higher degree of complex operations. Interestingly, we find that a larger SSB size may result in lower agency costs and that the greater the size of the unrestricted contracts, the higher the agency costs. This implies that unrestricted profit-sharing contracts are one of the main sources of the unique agency relationships in Islamic banks. The paper has a number of policy implications for regulators including the design of governance mechanisms in Islamic banks and the dynamics of unrestricted contracts. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the effects of board diversity on bank profitability and risk. Using a sample of 97 Chinese banks over a period from 2009 to 2013, we find that board age diversity is negatively associated with bank profitability. To further investigate why age-diverse boards influence bank performance, we decompose board age diversity into diversity of directors' personal values, utilizing the World Values Survey. Our findings suggest that the heterogeneity among directors' views on risk, prudence, and wealth is more likely to spark intragroup conflicts in the decision-making process. This prevents the board from functioning effectively and ultimately weakens bank profitability. Our results are robust with respect to alternative measures of diversity and bank performance.

This paper investigates whether the characteristics of boards of directors and audit committees and the formation of the latter are associated with firm performance. Agency theory suggests that well-governed firms perform relatively better than their poorly-governed counterparts. However, resource dependency theory suggests that a board with more insider directors could have more expertise on how to better operate the firm, thus contributing to better firm performance. Using a sample of firms publicly traded on the Athens Stock Exchange during 2008-2012, we find that those having large-sized boards performed better, but firms having more independent board members performed poorly. We also find that firms with small-sized boards and those with boards having more independent members are more likely to form audit committees, but we failed to find any association between audit committee characteristics and firm performance. In addition, we do not find a negative relation between board independence and future firm performance. These findings suggest that boards of Greek firms take more active role in advising than monitoring. These findings have implications for policymakers, researchers, corporate managers, and investors, in general, and particularly, those in emerging markets. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate how gender diversity in top management - i.e. boardroom and top management positions - affects business performance among Colombian public businesses. Design/methodology/approach: Building on the upper echelon theory which emphasizes that gender in an important characteristic that influences top management's decision-making, panel data models are used on a sample of 54 Colombian public businesses for the period 2008-2015 to test the proposed hypotheses relating to gender diversity and subsequent business performance. Findings: The results support that gender diversity is positively associated with subsequent business performance. More concretely, the relationship between gender diversity at the top of the corporate hierarchy - in the present case, as CEO and in the top management team - and subsequent performance becomes more evident when performance is linked to business operations (ROA), whereas the positive effect of women's representation in the boardroom and subsequent performance is significant when performance is measured via shareholder-oriented metrics (ROE). Originality/value: Few studies have addressed the role of gender diversity on performance in developing economies. This study contributes to better understand how gender diversity affects performance in contexts where women are underrepresented in the top management, and where the appointment of women directors or managers is not driven by regulatory pressures.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the impact of board characteristics on the financial performance of listed firms in Tanzania. Board characteristics, including outside directors, board size, CEO/Chair duality, gender diversity, board skill and foreign directors are addressed in the Tanzanian context by applying two corporate governance theories, namely, agency theory and resource dependence theory. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses balanced panel data regression analysis on 80 firm-years observations (2006-2013) from annual reports, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 key stakeholders. The study uses also a mixed methods approach and applies a convergent parallel design (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2011) to integrate quantitative and qualitative data. Findings: It was found that in terms of agency theory, while the findings support the separation of CEO/Chairperson roles, they do not support outside directors-financial performance linkage. With regard to resource dependence theory, the findings suggest that gender diversity has a positive impact on financial performance. Furthermore, the findings do not support an association between financial performance and board size, PhD qualification and foreign directors. Practical implications: The study contributes to the understanding of board-performance link and provides academic evidence to policy makers in Tanzania for current and future governance reforms. Originality/value: The findings contribute to the literature by providing new and original insights that, within a developing setting, extend current understanding of the association between corporate governance and financial performance. This is predicated, also, on the use of uncommon mixed methods approach. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Debates around sound corporate governance propose board diversity as a key attribute to sufficiently challenge executive management for stakeholder engagement. This study contributes to this debate by empirically investigating the effect of board diversity on corporate social disclosure (CSD) of Vietnamese listed firms. The study finds a significantly positive effect of diversity-in-boards (dissimilarities among directors within a board, i.e., demographic attributes of board members) on CSD while diversity-of-boards (dissimilarities among firm boards, i.e., board structure) has no effect on CSD. The results contribute by showing that a single theoretical approach can provide an adequate explanation for board diversity. The study contributes methodologically by demonstrating the design and measurement of board diversity indices, and a three-dimensional stakeholder-relevant CSD index. The findings benefit regulators and corporate executives in better understanding firms' CSD practices and stakeholders' expectations. (c) 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Scholars have expressed concern that marketing's influence at the strategic levels of the firm is waning. Consistent with this view, only 2.6% of firms' board members have marketing experience. The authors suggest that this is shortsighted and that including more marketing-experienced board members (MEBMs) will increase firm growth by (1) helping firms prioritize growth as a strategic objective and (2) contributing their expertise to improve the effectiveness of revenue growth strategies. Drawing on the behavioral model of corporate governance, the authors develop a theoretical framework explicating the situational, dispositional, and structural influence moderators that alter the impact ofMEBMs on firm growth. Using 64,086 director biographies from S&P 1500 firms, the authors find thatMEBMs positively affect firm-level revenue growth and that this relationship is strengthened or weakened by important contingencies that occur in the firm. The findings suggest that the common practice of not including experienced marketers on boards of directors puts firms at a competitive disadvantage. (c) 2018 American Marketing Association.

Entrepreneurial success in family SMEs is largely determined by the knowledge, skills, and new ideas contributed by board directors, the most important actors in the formulation of corporate strategy and decision making. The composition of family SME boards has traditionally been homogeneous, as such boards usually comprise male family members. Boards' contributions, however, depend on their level of diversity and strategic involvement. This study analyzes the moderating effects of two main sources of board diversity in family firms, family involvement level and gender diversity, as potential means of enhancing family firms' success when exploiting entrepreneurial initiatives. This study also explores whether these two potential moderators depend on the strategic involvement of the board directors. Based on a sample of 230 Spanish family firms, we found that the link between entrepreneurial orientation and performance is stronger in firms with lower levels of family involvement and higher levels of gender diversity in the board. Moreover, the board's high strategic involvement may strengthen the positive impact of gender diversity and change the moderating influence of family involvement from negative to positive.

Following the attention-based view of the firm (ABV), boards of directors' link to corporate sustainable development (CSD) could be dependent upon certain attention structures: valuation of environmental stimuli, rules of the game and the players. Studying a sample of large Australian firms, the findings indicate that the proposed attention-directing structures do appear to be linked to CSD in a manner consistent with the ABV. Specifically, creating awareness through scanning efforts links boards to CSD. Stakeholder debate, as a boardroom rule, is also significantly associated with CSD. Furthermore, as a so-called 'player' on the board, women directors have a moderating effect on the relationships between environmental scanning, stakeholder debate and CSD. The findings are discussed along with limitations and directions for future research. Copyright (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

We draw on a phenomenological model of institutional theory to explore how sub-national policies shape corporate board gender diversity of publicly traded firms. Using a sample of S&P 1500 firms in 49 U.S. states from 2003 to 2014, we find that firms headquartered in states with progressive policies that protect women from discrimination and provide greater availability of emergency contraception and public funding for abortions have greater shares of women directors in their board of directors. Our findings hold after a series of robustness checks and offer implications for theory, policy, and practice. (c) 2018

Drawing from corporate governance research and social identity theory, the authors argue that the relationship between outside directors' time in office and outside director task involvement is more complex than generally anticipated. By using a unique multisource data set composed of peer ratings provided by fellow outside directors rating a focal director's task involvement, this study analyzes director task involvement at the individual director level of analysis. The authors propose and empirically demonstrate that outside director tenure has an inverted U-shaped relationship with outside director task involvement that is moderated by a director's social identification with the organization. As such, the authors demonstrate that social identification with the organization provides a critical contingency for the curvilinear relationship between outside director tenure and outside director task involvement. Findings suggest that outside directors who socially identify with the organization are more likely to grow "stale in the saddle" at lower levels of tenure. These findings provide support for the merit of analyzing outside directors at the individual level of analysis and suggest that a "one-size-fits-all" approach may not be most appropriate in assessing the effects of tenure on outside director functioning.

Despite substantive organizational ramifications, surprisingly little theory explains executive succession planning processes. A firm's board of directors has the fiduciary responsibility to select CEOs, but, historically, boards have failed to exercise this authority. Increasing focus on corporate governance has prompted directors to become more engaged in organizational management, but boards face significant barriers to gathering and processing information. However, there is a dearth of research examining how boards overcome informational barriers to enhance decision-making effectiveness. Accordingly, the current study integrates procedural rationality in decision-making with research on boards as information-processing groups to explore how and why boards conduct succession planning processes. Procedural rationality results in formalized processes designed to collect essential information about CEO succession candidates; these processes, in turn, lead to a greater quantity and quality of CEO succession candidates. We also illustrate how CEOs can influence the effectiveness of board information gathering and processing. The tests of the theoretically generated hypotheses rely on in-depth qualitative interviews, coupled with unique survey and archival data from 355 firm-year observations of 218 large organizations, collected over three years.

Using the Heckman two-stage method, this study empirically investigates whether board directors' work experience in government and multinational corporations (MNCs), as well as the proportion of outside directors affects export propensity and export performance based on a sample of Korean firms. We find that the Korean firms with former government officials on the board are more likely to engage in exporting, although there is no empirical evidence supporting export performance. The findings also show that firms with former MNC employees on the board demonstrate higher levels of export propensity and export performance. Similarly, firms with a higher proportion of outside directors exhibit a higher level of export propensity and export performance. These findings highlight the importance of the board of directors in Korean firms' first stage of internationalization and provide new insights into which type of board members can benefit their firms in terms of export propensity and export performance.

The aim of this research is to examine what impact female institutional directors on boards have on corporate performance. Previous research shows that institutional female directors cannot be considered as a homogeneous group since they represent investors who may or may not maintain business relations with the companies on whose corporate boards they sit. Thus, it is not only the effect of female institutional directors as a whole on firm value that has been analysed, but also the impact of pressure-resistant female directors, who represent institutional investors (investment, pension and mutual funds) that only invest in the company, and do not maintain a business relation with the firm. We hypothesize that there is a non-linear association, specifically quadratic, between institutional and pressure-resistant female directors on boards and corporate performance. Our results report that female institutional directors on boards enhance corporate performance, but when they reach a certain threshold on boards (11.72 %), firm value decreases. In line with female institutional directors, pressure-resistant female directors on boards also increase firm value, but only up to a certain figure (12.71 % on boards), above which they have a negative impact on firm performance. These findings are consistent with an inverted U-shaped relationship between female institutional directors and pressure-resistant female directors and firm performance.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze, in the Colombian developing context, the relationship between the presence of women in corporate positions and the financial performance of the company and to know if there are differences between family and non-family firms. Design/methodology/approach: Building on the contingency theory of leadership, which emphasizes that leader's personality and the situation in which that leader operates influences corporate decision-making, the authors use panel data models on a sample of 54 Colombian public businesses for the period 2008-2015 to test the proposed hypotheses on the relationship between women's presence in corporate governance positions and financial performance, as well as the difference between family and non-family firms. Findings: The results support that women's presence in corporate governance positions is positively associated with firm performance. More concretely, the authors find a relationship between women at the top corporate governance structure (as part of the board of directors, top management team and chief executive officer) and firm profitability. Results also indicate that family business, as a type of organization, (negatively) moderates the positive relationship between female participation in top executive positions (board and top executive team) and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: First, this study is limited to women in corporate positions in large companies listed on the Colombia Stock Exchange, and thus, generalizability for smaller entities may be limited. Second, data limitations do not allow us to investigate ways in which women's presence in corporate governance structures contributes to improve firm goals. Practical implications: The authors provide support to the hypothesis that positively relates women's presence in corporate governance positions and firm performance for the case of Colombia. This serves as a guidance to Colombian regulators, corporate decision-makers and policy-makers to promote the inclusion of women in top hierarchical structures through either mandatory laws or recommendation. Originality/value: Few studies have addressed the women's presence in corporate governance positions and contribution to firm performance in developing economies. This study contributes to better understand how women impact performance in contexts where women are underrepresented in corporate governance structure and where there are no laws that pressure firms to appoint women in corporate governance positions.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to synthesize the diverse literature on board demographic diversity and to provide avenues for future research. Design/methodology/approach: The study provides a comprehensive literature review of theoretical and empirical studies published in leading management journals from 1989 to 2015. Findings: The literature review revealed several aspects that are related to board demographic diversity. These aspects have been classified into: definitions and types of board diversity, dimensions of board demographic diversity, measurement and outcomes of board diversity, reasons for existing conflicting empirical findings about the relationship between board diversity and firm dynamics, and research on mediators and moderators. Originality/value: Issues pertaining to board demographic diversity identified in this paper have theoretical and practical implications, and include avenues for future research.

Research summary: We examine the consequences of the formalization of the board leadership structure at IPO for board-level turnover. We introduce the concept of director undervaluation. It indicates the degree to which a director's qualifications based on normatively accepted criteria for board leadership are not duly reflected in his/her appointments to the board chair and committee chair positions. We find that the higher the average undervaluation of directors on the board ("board undervaluation"), the greater the turnover levels of undervalued directors. This effect is stronger when board interaction frequency is higher. We contribute to the behavioral perspective on corporate governance by introducing justice-based legitimacy as a key normative institution, and by providing a novel predictor of aggregate turnover of directors (as well as the firm's CEO). Managerial summary: Why do outside directors exit the board? We offer a novel answer to this question in the context of newly public firms. We suggest that when directors are passed over for the board chair and committee chair positions despite having higher qualifications than their peers, they have been "undervalued," and a negative board climate is likely to develop. We find that the higher the average undervaluation of directors on the board, the higher the turnover levels of these undervalued directors. More frequent board meetings exacerbate these turnover levels. Further, these turnover effects are not restricted to undervalued directors--even the CEO is more likely to exit. This study demonstrates the critical importance of developing a legitimate and fair board leadership structure. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Boards operate notionally in a liminal, nonhierarchical space, neither inside the company nor outside, creating ambiguity between service and control functions and fostering tolerance of it. With repeated corporate governance crises, however, new prescriptions institutionalized in law, regulation, and codes of conduct have added significance to the control side, marked by monitoring and compliance tasks. Taking a cue from the strategy process and strategy-as-practice literature, this study revisits the work of directors on the service side: their engagement in strategizing. Formalization of board processes has led to greater structure and reduced the liminality of the board. Using interviews with 20 directors from a range of organization types, this study finds that directors experiment respond to increased institutionalization of board practice by seeking out new liminal spaces and informal practices, with implications for theory of boards, board activities, and public policy.

While academic researchers continue to debate the effect of board independence in increasing performance, its efficacy could also be reflected in whether firm performance is made more stable. Board governance activities are a constellation of actions aimed at managing agency costs and ensuring the viability of a company over time. The efficacy of such actions would, therefore, be reflected in a distal outcome, specifically, in lower firm performance variability. Boards that can control agency costs and limit both underinvestment and overinvestment would reduce a firm's deviation from its mean performance trajectory. Using a longitudinal sample of publicly traded companies in the United States, we find that board stability, board resource provision, and CEO influence are negatively associated with performance variability. Board independence is not associated with performance variability. With increasing board independence, greater board stability and greater CEO influence are negatively associated with performance variability, however, greater board resource provision is not associated with performance variability.

This study examines if the effort of financially linked independent (FLI) directors enable firms to reemerge from bankruptcy, a major organizational crisis. Using a sample of 307 bankrupt U.S. firms with instrumental variables regression methodology, I find that the efforts of these directors are critical for firm reemergence. FLI directors' efforts increase the likelihood of reemergence as well as improve access to financial resources. In contrast, I do not find any evidence that non-FLI directors' efforts are associated with reemergence. I also find that resourceful but uninvolved directors are not helpful for firms trying to navigate their way out of bankruptcy. My study highlights (a) the changing nature of roles played by directors in various lifecycle stages, (b) the greater importance of resource provisioning over monitoring during reemergence, and (c) that efforts of FLI directors, and not others director categories, matter for reemergence. Overall, my study extends research that suggests directors' motivation may cause differential firm outcomes and provides evidence that directors do not always put in their best effort on behalf of their firms. This, I suggest, has profound implications for corporate governance research and practice. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

Upper echelons (UE) theory posits that organisational performance reflects the personal values and cognitive frames of the top management team (TMT) and, crucially, that greater heterogeneity in individual backgrounds of senior executives leads to better outcomes. However, often missing from this research is a more developed account of how this relationship between the characteristics of TMTs and performance is also mediated by internal conditions within organisations. In this paper we begin to address this deficiency focusing on the mediating impact of employee satisfaction and the styles and practices of line managers. Looking at the empirical case of English National Health Services acute care hospital trusts, we use a multiple mediation model to analyse the relationship between board heterogeneity, performance and these two (internal) organisational factors. A variance-based structural equation modelling approach (partial least square) is applied to a sample of 102 boards of directors. First, the results lend support to the UE hypothesis that there is a positive impact of board heterogeneity and hos-pital-level performance. Second, the analysis shows that the relationship heterogeneity-performance is positively influenced by: (a) the styles and practices of line managers; (b) the levels of staff satisfaction; and by their mutually reinforcing roles.

Two key groups central to improving firm performance are the top management team (TMT) and the board of directors. Executives undertake strategic actions, whereas board members fulfill their resource provision and monitoring roles. Drawing on tournament theory and equity theory, we propose that high pay dispersion among outside directors and the TMT is positively associated with strategic risk, whereas high (low) TMT pay dispersion and low (high) outside director pay dispersion are positively associated with firm performance. Our predictor is the unexplained component of horizontal pay dispersion, or the residual of pay dispersion resulting from regressing pay on observable firm, industry, period, and individual characteristics. Our results highlight the importance of unexplained pay dispersion for TMTs, but not for boards of directors, in improving firm performance. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This study illustrates how control-ownership wedge impacts the monitoring role of the corporate board through the quality of audit services in Turkey. Turkey has made essential amendments in the field of external audit in order to enhance the quality of the financial report and integrate its own capital market with that of the EU. It would be of interest to examine the influence of these changes on clients' demand for high quality audit. The agency theory is integrated with the resource dependence theory to show that boards possess distinct incentives and ability to demand high quality audit to monitor management activities. Logistic regression and feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) were used for regression estimations. The results indicate that board demographics, cognitive and structural diversity of board of directors, audit committee characteristics and audit quality are complementary and control-ownership wedge weakens the relationship between them which is an unfavorable outcome for minority shareholders. Thus, this study proposes that regulators should increase law enforcement to enhance good corporate governance in Turkey to accommodate the unique features of wedge firms and provide a protected environment for minority shareholders.

Using a panel dataset of non-financial public companies in Italy covering the period 2005-2013, this paper provides an empirical analysis of the relationship between female representation on corporate boards and corporate debt. The presence of women in the boardroom might seem to push significantly on debt leverage and suggest a complementary role in the control and monitoring of agency costs. However, consistent with Kanter's (Am J Sociol 82(5), 965-990, 1977) critical mass theory, that at a level of tokenism women take on a complementary role and at greater levels, their role either becomes a substitute for debt level, or plays a weaker complementary role in debt level and in the monitoring of agency costs. The presence of women board members who are linked to the family firm appears to significantly decrease the degree of debt leverage. Furthermore, the presence of greater female representation in the boardroom decreases the agency costs to the firm. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Gender diversity in family firms is increasingly attracting the attention of scholars across several fields. Despite this, there are few literature reviews that synthesize these research streams in the context of family businesses. To fill this gap, we examined the literature on gender diversity on the boards of family businesses by providing some insights into how the typical traits of family firms' boards interact with the diversity effects linked to the presence of women. This analysis is the starting point for identifying possible research areas not yet addressed by scholars, and therefore defining the research agenda on the subject. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

This article addresses the issue of sustainability of Italian opera houses by focusing on the relationship between board composition and organizational performance. Integrating agency and resource dependence theory, the authors develop a taxonomy of board profiles for opera houses and test the impact of both individual profiles and board diversity on the performance of Italian Lyric Symphonic Foundations (LSFs). They posit that different profiles will affect theatres' revenue structure differently, as each profile drives specific types of revenue, such as earned income, private funds and public funds. In order to empirically test their hypotheses, they perform a panel data analysis with fixed-effects and bootstrap resampling (N = 5,000) and robust clustered errors around theatres over an 11-year period (2001-12). While the literature stresses the crucial role of all board members in orienting an organization's performance, these new findings show the importance of different board profiles in affecting LSF revenue structure. The authors conclude that the board of directors can and should be mobilized to ensure the organization's growth. (c) 2018 Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC), Montreal.

We propose and test a theory of board discretion in the context of the board's selection of a female CEO. We propose that boards also have discretion, an area that has typically focused exclusively on managers, and examine the conditions under which boards, facing high levels of uncertainty, have the latitude to make nontraditional choices, particularly when a negative equity market reaction to such a selection is likely. In the context of the nontraditional choice of a female CEO successor, we observe that the strong financial health of the firm and boardroom and situation-specific experience grant the board the discretion to select a female CEO. We test our model using all Standard & Poors (S&P) 1500 firms that experienced a CEO succession between 2000 and 2013. Implications for practice and research are discussed. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

What role does the board of directors play in fostering organisational innovation? This study contributes to this conversation by exploring the relationship between board characteristics and business model innovation adoption. Drawing from resource dependence theory and using the smart home business model as our context, we examined the relationship among board size, CEO duality and proportion of outside directors on the likelihood of business model innovation adoption. Our analysis of 96 firms indicates that both board size and CEO duality significantly increase the likelihood of business model innovation adoption. Our findings highlight the important resource provision role boards play in promoting organisational innovation. (c) 2018 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact that PhD scientists serving on the board of directors of firms conducting hard science have on the R&D-based innovative performance of the firm. Design/methodology/approach: The research hypotheses are built upon extant theory, and they are tested using two-stage least squared regression that control for the endogenous nature of board composition. Results are robust to alternative specifications. Findings: This analysis shows that firms with higher numbers of PhD scientists on the board generate superior innovative output and more efficient monitoring; PhD board members with denser professional networks are more valuable as board members. Practical implications: This paper provides practical advice to innovative firms on how to create a governance process that simultaneously improves monitoring and boosts the innovative performance. Originality/value: This study is the first one to suggest that innovative firms can improve R&D monitoring and boost innovative output at the same time, and the first to investigate the role that PhD scientists can serve on the board of firms engaging in hard science.

In small and medium-sized organizations, boards of directors often spend most of their time providing advice to the management. As the content of advice provided has seldom been the focus of previous studies, we differentiate between functional and firm-specific advisory tasks. We examine antecedents of the two types to explain why this differentiation is important. Applying group effectiveness arguments, we study the effects board members' different knowledge bases and diversity have on the two advisory tasks, considering the mediating effects of board processes. Our results suggest that it is important to distinguish between different types of board members' knowledge and different board advisory tasks. Our findings have direct implications for research and practice. First, there is a need to go beyond the surface level understanding of what boards are doing. Second, our results emphasize the importance of organizational knowledge, and hence question the call for independent board members for advice provision. (c) 2017 European Academy of Management

International Business (IB) research has surveyed firms' internationalization by examining the geographical dispersion of their sales and assets. However, less attention has been devoted to an important facet of their internationalization: the globalization of boards of directors. Drawing on institutional theory, we study the determinants of board foreign diversity by focusing on firms' sub-national socio-cultural context. We theorize on factors such as: attitudes toward immigration and conservatism that may impact the legitimacy of certain governance practices and may exert an influence on firms' propensity to internationalize their boards. Using a sample of S&P1500 from 2004 to 2014, we find support for our theory after using several controls. By bringing to the fore the interplay between sub-national factors and the globalization of boards, our study offers several implications for IB research. More broadly, our research delves into factors related to firms' sub-national environment that are likely to challenge their internationalization. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Strategic decision-making processes influence firm-level outcomes. Using the theory of upper echelons, this study investigates how diversity in directors' skills, knowledge, and industry experience influence board decision-making processes that may impact overall strategic decision-making processes. Such diversity has been commonly accepted to be a 'double-edged sword'--enhancing comprehensiveness but hindering the speed of decision-making. On the contrary, we used an existing large survey database to show that directors' diverse educational background, functional background, and industry experience (job-related diversity) have a positive effect on comprehensiveness as well as the speed of board decision-making. In addition, our results indicate that board processes (directors' use of their knowledge and skills) play an important role by transmitting the positive effects of diversity. The study is in a tradition of exploring how boards may influence firms' strategic decision-making processes. Our findings provide additional arguments for adding job-related diversity to boards of directors. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

This article investigates whether the presence of advisory directors and monitoring directors varies across firm life cycle stages. We follow a parsimonious life cycle proxy based on the predicted behaviour of operating, investing and financing cash flows across the different life cycle stages that result from firm performance and the allocation of resources. Using an Australian sample, this study shows that compared to mature-stage firms, firms in the introduction, shake-out and decline stages have more advisory directors. With respect to the demand for monitoring directors, we find that compared to mature-stage firms, firms in the introduction, shake-out and decline stages have fewer monitoring directors on the board. We contribute to the literature on boards of directors by documenting that firms choose an optimal board structure based on their economic characteristics. JEL Classification: D22, G38, M14.

Using data from China's listed privately owned enterprises (POEs) during the period from 2002 to 2014, we explore the effects of firm life cycle on board structure. We find that the board size of China's listed POEs declines over firm life cycle, and there is a trend of separation for board chair-CEO duality while board independence remains almost static. We further provide evidence that board size and independence are determined by the benefits of monitoring and advisory roles of the boards through all the stages of firms' life cycle with different drivers. The impact of CEO power on board chair-CEO duality is determined by the benefits and costs of separation of board chair, and CEOs are supported at all stages of firms' life cycle. This article sheds light on the dynamic board structure in an emerging economy where the external corporate governance is weaker than that of developed countries. Our findings suggest that the board structures of China's listed POEs are adjusted at various stages of firms' life cycle, and the adjustments are mostly based on the resources brought by the new board of directors.

Board diversity has been the recurring theme for discussions both in the academic and corporate environments. The concept of diversity is broad and encompasses not only gender and ethnic variety, but also the diversity of cultural, social, and professional aspects. This research aims to contribute to the understanding of the influence of company boards on corporate policies, by analyzing the effects of board diversity on firms' financial/ capital structure decisions. The results suggest that board diversity improves monitoring effectiveness and is positively related with firm leverage, in line with the effects of reduction of managerial entrenchment by means of stronger monitoring.

Firm performance is a major concern for all organizations and involves a multitude of antecedents. Reducing environmental uncertainty and dependency through the use of strategic actions in the resource dependency theory (RDT) framework and enhancing work practices through high performance work systems (HPWS) lead to higher levels of firm performance. We reveal the interconnectivity between RDT and HPWS and develop propositions as to how components of HPWS positively moderate the relationship between firm performance and the environmental uncertainty-reducing strategic actions proposed by RDT such as mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, boards of directors, political action, and executive succession.

Gender equality on boards is a global and highly politicized issue. To this day, there is considerable cross-country variation in female board representation. We examine institutional supply- and demand-side factors associated with this issue. Our results indicate that a societal climate of gender equality contributes to more women on boards, mainly through fostering the supply of suitable candidates. Therefore, the glass ceiling should be improved through a societal supply-side effort which needs to complement demand-side (quota) regulation. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies have been unable to establish a clear relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance. We argue that this could be due to the failure of these studies to account for both the endogeneity problem and the possible nonlinearity of the relationship between board diversity and firm performance. We overcome these problems by studying the investor reaction at the announcement of a female director's departure. We find a negative market reaction only when this departure drops the gender diversity below a critical level of three women. In all other cases, a director's departure has no significant impact on shareholder wealth. This result is consistent with the assumption of value in diversity and critical mass theory.

Using a legitimacy lens, we theorize that changes in the firm's board of directors parallel the evolving stakeholder audience that accords legitimacy to the firm--a key resource to the firm's survival. Powerful new stakeholders post- initial public offering (IPO) such as the listing exchange and the securities regulators are anticipated to impact board gender diversity through their regulatory pressure, while pre-IPO investors such as venture capitalists are reducing their equity positions and thus providing opportunities for director turnover. At the same time, the firm is increasing in size and visibility, building additional sociocultural legitimacy pressures for increased gender diversity. While prior research centers on the effect of different types and intensity of legitimacy pressures on board characteristics, we explore how changes in the question of firms' legitimacy "to whom" affects board composition, that is, we examine the comparative effect of regulation and society on board composition. We test our hypotheses by analyzing panel data for all North American technology firms doing IPOs on the NASDAQ exchange during a 12-year time frame between 1997 and 2011. Our analysis shows that regulation, although not explicitly directive, can play a key role in accelerating board gender diversity.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine whether a private firm's demand for a Big4 auditor is influenced by the auditor choice of its main supplier, customer and competitor. The authors rely on institutional theory to explain this stakeholders' influence. The authors also examine whether the extent to which the firm's board of directors engages in networking moderates this influence. Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaire data are combined with archival data of 210 Belgian private firms with a statutory audit requirement. Logistic regression analysis is applied to examine to what extent firms follow their main competitor, customer and supplier in hiring a Big4 auditor. Findings: The results reveal a positive association between the firm's choice of a Big4 auditor and its main supplier being audited by a Big4 auditor, supporting the conformance effect (isomorphism) toward suppliers as hypothesized by institutional theory. The extent of board networking, however, seems to weaken this effect. Toward competitors, a divergence effect instead of a conformance effect is found, which indicates the existence of competitive differentiation regarding auditor choice. Research limitations/implications: While prior studies mainly focus on the agency relationships between shareholders, debtholders and managers to explain auditor choice, this study also takes into account the firm's other main stakeholders by relying on institutional theory. Both the conformance effect toward suppliers as well as the divergence effect toward competitors provide interesting additional perspectives on why auditors are demanded, leading to interesting future research opportunities. Originality/value: This paper fulfills an identified need to consider additional theories in explaining audit outcomes. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Despite that fact that Iraq has gone very far in the liberalization of women, Iraqi board of directors is still dominated by men. However, gender diversity is one of the largest concepts of board diversity and a major issue within corporate governance where several studies seek to discover the influence of diversity on firm performance. This article aims at examining the effect of women representation on firm performance of Iraqi listed firms using panel regression analysis. The empirical results of this paper provide evidence of a positive and significant relationship between female directors and firm performance as measured by Return on Assets while no relationship with the Tobin's q. The important policy implication of this finding is that the Iraqi Stock Exchange and Iraqi Security Commission should incorporate gender diversity in CG practices and encourage women directorship in Iraq.

Directors of firms are theorized to fulfil control, service and resource dependence roles. However, the ways in which directors' of Chinese MNCs govern their foreign subsidiaries, and perform these roles remains unclear. Building on the institutional logics perspective, this study explores the roles enacted by the boards of directors eight Chinese-controlled companies in Australia to gain an appreciation of their governance practices. In depth semi-structured interviews with insider and independent directors, consultants and market analysts were undertaken. A content analysis of company annual reports and web sites complimented primary sources of data on board functions. Findings reveal that control is the most dominant role played by these boards, rather than service or resource dependence. It also appears that the dominant logics of Chinese institutions influence the corporate governance of Chinese MNCs as they internationalize. These findings extend our understanding of corporate governance practices in China and abroad. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The study examined the linear and curvilinear relationships between the number of women on boards and corporate social responsibility (CSR) among medium- to large-sized publicly listed for-profit companies in Australia. The relationship was predicted as positive linear based on the resource dependence theory (RDT) and inverted U-shaped based on the integration of RDT and group structure theory. The results show a positive linear relationship between women on boards and CSR, whereas the curvilinear relationship was not significant. Our findings suggest that the presence of women on boards increases the organizations' focus towards the CSR activities. Future research might consider the impact of women on boards on CSR in different cultural contexts or by segmenting population based on industry type.

Purpose: This study aims to use the original data collected from school board members representing nonprofit charter schools in the state of Minnesota to examine the relationship between the distribution of board-executive governance responsibilities and the performance of organizations operating as part of a New Public Management style macro-governance reform. Design/methodology/approach: A combination of survey data collected from Minnesota charter school board members and hard performance data were utilized in two OLS regression models to predict the link between organizational governance and school performance. Findings: The authors find that boards can improve hard measures of organizational performance by shifting responsibility of day-to-day operations closer to the executive, and public advocacy duties closer to the board. The results build on the existing literatures on school board governance and board-executive relations. Overall, the findings suggest the existence of an ideal balance between board-executive governance responsibilities in key functional areas on charter school boards. Originality/value: Though a healthy literature exists regarding the value of charter schools, very few studies have actually explored the way in which these organizations are governed. This study is the first to link charter board governance responsibilities to performance. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Employing a synthesis model, this chapter examines the relationship between board structure and board processes within family firms. By reviewing the family firm governance literature from the past 20 years, we apply the Ilgen et al. (Annu Rev Psychol 56:517-543, 2005) input-mediator-output-input framework to identify heterogeneous family processes which ultimately impact the forming, functioning, and finishing stages of boards of directors in family firms. In doing so, we help to answer questions of why family firm boards are effective rather than what predicts board effectiveness, as well as provide guidance for future research.

The paper analyzes the pervasiveness of family board memberships within family business groups (FBGs), which are large and diversified form of family businesses dominant in emerging economies. The data pertain to 2017 and include board information on 640 firms affiliated to the largest 26 FBGs in Turkey. The study cluster analyzes the FBGs according to family involvement in their governance. Derived from different theoretical lenses, it also aims to identify the variables that condition different clusters. Results show that several decades after liberalization, families still control the groups pervasively though with varying degrees. Regarding the extent of family involvement in governance, different clusters are identified as tight control, vertical control, and loose control. Ownership structure emerges as the main antecedent that differentiates FBGs in different clusters. (c) 2018 Universidad de Malaga. All Rights Reserved.

Recently, foreigners have been responsible for negotiating more than half of the shares issued by the companies listed in the Brazilian Stock Market. In order to understand the characteristics of companies that influence the increase of international financing, the aim of this article was to investigate the relation between foreign investment in public offerings and board composition. We examine data of 183 Brazilian IPOs and subsequent offerings from 2004-2016 using OLS regression. The empirical result suggested that companies that have a foreign director as a board member and are in a special listing segment of B3--bound by rules of corporate governance--tend to attract more foreign investment. This means that foreigners are sensitive to good corporate governance practices when financing Brazilian firms' IPOs or that issue new shares. Our findings imply that improvements in the corporate governance practice of companies could increase their ability to raise foreign capital. RESUMERecientemente, mas de la mitad de las acciones emitidas por las empresas cotizadas en la Bolsa de Valores brasilena fueron negociadas por extranjeros. El objeto de este estudio consistio en investigar la relacion existente entre las inversiones extranjeras en las ofertas publicas y la composicion de sus juntas directivas, para entender las caracteristicas de las empresas que contribuyen a aumentar el financiamiento internacional. Utilizando la regresion de minimos cuadrados ordinarios dinamicos (MCOD, OLS en ingles), examinamos datos de la Oferta Publica Inicial Brasilena 183 (IPO) asi como ofertas subsiguientes del periodo 2004-2016. El resultado empirico obtenido sugiere que las empresas cuya junta directiva tiene como miembro un director extranjero y constan en un segmento de cotizacion especial (B3), sujeto a normas de gobernanza corporativa, suelen atraer mas inversiones extranjeras. Esto implica que, al financiarlas, los extranjeros son mas susceptibles a que las empresas brasilenas que abren su capital o emiten nuevas acciones, usen buenas practicas de gobernanza corporativa. Nuestros hallazgos sugieren que la implementacion de mejoras en las practicas de gobernanza corporativa de las empresas puede aumentar su financiamiento internacional. RESUMORecentemente os estrangeiros passaram a ser responsaveis pela negociacao de mais da metade das acoes emitidas pelas empresas listadas na Bolsa de Valores brasileira. Para entender as caracteristicas das empresas que influenciam o aumento do financiamento internacional, o presente trabalho tem como objetivo o estudo da relacao entre o investimento estrangeiro nas ofertas publicas e a composicao das diretorias. Examinamos dados de 183 IPOs (Oferta Publica Inicial) e de ofertas subsequentes, de 2004 a 2016, usando a regressao MQO (OLS na sigla em ingles). O resultado empirico sugere que as empresas que tem um diretor estrangeiro na diretoria e que estao no segmento de listagem especial da B3--sujeitas as normas de governanca corporativa--tendem a atrair mais investimentos. Isso significa que os estrangeiros estao alerta quanto as boas praticas de governanca ao considerar empresas brasileiras que abrem o capital ou que emitem acoes novas. Os nossos achados sugerem que melhorias nas praticas de governanca corporativa das empresas podem elevar o financiamento internacional das empresas. (c) 2018, (c) 2018 Taylor & Francis.

This paper examines the effect of key board distinctiveness on managerial risk-taking behaviour. Using a total sample of 121 firms made up of 1,166 corporate directors and 847 firm-year observations, the study finds robust evidence across the three stages of estimation that suggests power separation in terms of CEO non-duality is negatively associated with executive risk-taking due to enhanced board assertiveness and independence. Board size is inversely associated with the variability of market value measure both within and at inter-firm levels. With average board membership in the study sample made up of 10 directors, the study finds crucial empirical evidence that points to the key benefits of large board configuration including the social capital, diversity of thoughts, knowledge, and experience, effectiveness and vigilance which curtails executive entrenchment. In contrast, the paper records positive association between the presence of foreign directors and corporate risk-taking. Due to their wealth of experiences, foreign directors tend to have more strategic sense of purpose and are likely not to hesitate in taking appropriate risk decisions when it really matters. While the paper finds little evidence that suggests a within-firm positive relationship between board independence and managerial risky propensities, there was no evidence found to indicate that board quality and ethnic diversity affects corporate risk-taking.

Gender diversity in corporate governance is a popular topic in management environment studies. One of the most significant components of this concept is women in boards. Due to the inequalities of women in boards there are a number of academic studies on women in top management. This chapter explains gender diversification problem in boards. Furthermore, reasons for workforce diversity in decision-making levels are determined. The role and critical mass of women members in different cultures are discussed. Finally, it introduces the representation levels of women in the boards of BIST 100 companies in Turkey. Data is obtained from annual reports, websites, and related documents of companies.

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to examine the interaction between the structure of the top management team, takeover defense mechanisms and firms rate of collective actions. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses elements of agency theory, prospect theory and competitive dynamics research to develop a model for examining heterogeneity in the rate of collective actions among firms in the technology sector. A sample of 299 firm-year observations arrayed into panel regression analyses is used. Findings: The findings from this study show a positive relationship between the size of the top management team and the count of collective actions when takeover defense mechanisms are present. Further this study finds a negative relationship between top management team ownership and collective actions when these same takeover defense mechanisms are present. Additionally, the female ratio of the top management team is negatively related to collective actions. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted using a sample of technological firms. These relationships may not be generalizable to firms in other contexts. Further, other elements of the firm's governance structure (i.e. board of directors or shareholders) may play an important role in the strategic decision-making process. Originality/value: This study expands on existing research by linking several blocks of literature, top management team literature, competitive dynamics literature and corporate governance literature, into a model to examine firm structural characteristics on the heterogeneity in the propensity to formulate collective actions among firms.

This study empirically examines the relationship between wide-ranging board diversity and the quality of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure variables in Malaysia. We extend prior literature covering broader dimensions of board diversity (e.g., gender, education level, education background, age, tenure, nationality and ethnicity) and their impact on CSR after controlling for board and audit committee characteristics. Using 200 listed firms in Bursa Malaysia during 2009-2013 and applying both OLS and 2SLS instrumental variables (IV) approaches, we document significant positive effect of board education level and board tenure diversity on the quality of CSR disclosure. Further analysis using robust regression also shows positive association between gender diversity and CSR disclosure. Our findings also demonstrate that the quality of CSR disclosure is significantly negatively associated with board age and nationality diversity. These results remain consistent with using alternative measures for board diversity, and characteristics for board of director and audit committees as well as split samples between large and small firms. Additional tests exhibit complementary relationship of education level and nationality with gender, while substitutive relationship of age and tenure with gender in influencing CSR. These findings provide useful insights into the policy makers in setting regulations in respect of board diversity in Malaysia and other emerging economies in the Asian region. Our evidence is also useful for listed companies in setting the criteria to identify directors who can support their strategic decisions. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Environmental degradation, scarcity of resources, and societal issues have been reshaping the strategic agendas and governance mechanisms of many organizations. From a traditional perspective, the duty of the board of directors (BOD) has always been to the owners and investors of the firm. With the beginning of the 21st century, a social paradigm has emerged, reflecting broader directors' responsibilities in not only fulfilling shareholders' interests but also addressing stakeholders' needs. Both research and practice emphasize a metamorphosis of the board's task, which is not restricted to maximizing shareholder's value but also involves going out into the real world and tackling the emerging concerns regarding social and ecological practices. Following the premises of stakeholder theory, this study examines the association between the determinants of the board of directors and sustainable performance. Based on the Dow Jones Sustainability (DJSI) and Standard and Poor's Global Broad Market Indices (S&P Global BMI), with a matching sample of 478 multinational companies, the results reveal a significant and positive relationship between sustainability and the board's size, gender diversity, average age of directors and number of committees. From a cross-national perspective, the study confirms the existence of dissimilarities in the characteristics of the boards of directors of European (EU) and non-European (non-EU) firms vis-a-vis sustainable performance. The practical implications of the study can be useful for policymakers and governance systems in identifying the nature of the "green" board. In light of the managerial inference, the study delivers an explicit recommendation on the composition of the board of directors and stakeholder management to promote sustainability adoption.

Purpose: This study aims to reconcile some of the conflicting results in prior studies of the board structure-firm performance relationship and to evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of agency theory in the specific context of Italian corporate governance practice. Design/methodology/approach: This research applies a dynamic generalised method of moments on a sample of Italian listed companies over the period 2003-2015. Proxies for corporate governance mechanisms are the board size, the level of board independence, ownership structure, shareholder agreements and CEO-chairman leadership. Findings: While directors elected by minority shareholders are not able to impact performance, independent directors do have a non-linear effect on performance. Board size has a positive effect on firm performance for lower levels of board size. Ownership structure per se and shareholder agreements do not affect firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This paper contributes to the literature on agency theory by reconciling some of the conflicting results inherent in the board structure-performance relationship. Firm performance is not necessarily improved by having a high number of independent directors on the board. Ownership structure and composition do not affect firm performance; therefore, greater monitoring provided by concentrated ownership does not necessarily lead to stronger firm performance. Practical implications: This paper suggests that Italian corporate governance law should improve the rules and effectiveness of minority directors by analysing whether they are able to impede the main shareholders to expropriate private benefits on the expenses of the minority. The legislator should not impose any restrictive regulations with regard to CEO duality, as the influence of CEO duality on performance may vary with respect to the unique characteristics of each company. Originality/value: The results enrich the understanding of the applicability of agency theory in listed companies, especially in Italy. Additionally, this paper provides a comprehensive synthesis of research evidence of agency theory studies. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The benefit of gender diversity on the board of directors is a subject of current debate. We contribute to the literature on diversity and its impact on businesses from an analytical framework that incorporates agency theory and the concept of socioemotional wealth (SEW). Our findings suggest that the inclusion of women on the board goes beyond ethical concerns being also relevant from a business perspective (i.e. increases risk-taking). The proportion of independent female directors on the board is shown to increase venturing risk (i.e. with the expectation of improving future performance), but does not interfere with performance hazard risk which conceptualizes the family desire to preserve SEW, especially in firms where these risks are low. By contrast, the proportion of non-independent female directors on the board increases significantly performance hazard risk, but only in family firms. In summary, we find with data from Latin America that the motivation for risk-taking differs depending on whether the appointment is as an independent female director, the type of risk and on whether the firm is controlled by a family.

Although increased board independence is a commonly offered solution to curbing corporate misconduct, scholars have expressed skepticism about its effectiveness, and empirical evidence is mixed. We argue that the relationship between board independence and corporate misconduct is likely nuanced--and may vary by the type of independence (e.g., independence on the whole board or on the audit committee) and by national context. We conducted a meta-analysis of 135 studies spanning more than 20 countries. We find that the board independence-corporate misconduct relationship (a) is generally negative, (b) varies based on the implementation form that independence takes on (i.e., independence of the whole board, on the audit committee, or between the roles of CEO and board chair), and (c) is more strongly negative in countries with less corruption. We advance corporate governance theory and research by demonstrating that the popular governance practice of increasing board independence must both account for the manner in which independence is implemented and consider the powerful influence of firms' broader societal context to clearly understand its effect. Further, based on our review of the literature, we uncover opportunities for the advancement of corporate governance and corporate misconduct research. (c) The Author(s) 2018.

Going beyond the mere participation of female directors within boardrooms, we investigate which of the two major boards of directors' roles (advisory versus monitoring) is best played by female directors in order to make a difference to shareholders. More specifically, we investigate the impact that advisory and monitoring female directors have on managerial opportunism with a specific focus on earnings management. Using sample of US firms, we find evidence suggesting that female directors holding monitoring roles mitigate managerial opportunism, as measured by discretionary accruals. In contrast to the current argument that advisory directors in general are better able to sustain and improve earnings quality, we find no evidence that suggests that advisory female directors are significantly associated with lower managerial opportunism. Overall, the results remain robust after controlling for potential endogeneity problems, corporate governance, and external auditor quality. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This study aims to analyze the efficiency of banks under board gender diversity and to examine the determinants of bank efficiency. Design/methodology/approach: Data for analysis were sourced from annual reports of 21 banks for the period from 2009 to 2017. A two-step framework was used: first, an examination of efficiency scores with and without board gender diversity computed using data envelopment analysis; and second, a regression of board gender diversity as a determinant of bank efficiency using panel estimation on an unbalanced panel data. Findings: The results reveal that gender diversity promotes bank efficiency up to a maximum of two female directors on a nine-member board of directors, suggesting a threshold effect on bank efficiency. Board size improves bank efficiency. Board independence is negatively related to bank efficiency. Also, powerful chief executive officers are detrimental for bank efficiency. Finally, the authors find that ownership structure, bank size, bank age and loan-to-deposit ratio are important factors affecting bank efficiency. Research limitations/implications: All bank-year observations with no female representation on the board were excluded. As such, this paper is limited to 21 banks. Future research should look at a larger data set and account for dynamic endogeneity. Practical implications: The paper contributes to bank governance structure, namely, gender composition of boards, and provides an insight for regulators and shareholders to estimate the role of men and women on boards. Originality/value: The novel feature of the efficiency model used is that it incorporates board gender diversity as an additional input variable, in line with the preposition of proponent of resource dependency theory.

Research Summary: This study explores how external pressure for board gender diversity influences the increase of female directors. We propose that while external pressure has a positive effect on the increase of female directors on boards, it heightens the salience of gender in new director selection, making incumbent male directors more likely to treat the new female directors as outgroup members and consequently more likely to add them through addition of board seats rather than substitution of male directors. We further predict that new female directors added through additional board seats are less likely to serve on major board committees than those added through substitution of male directors. Results from a large sample of S&P 1,500 firms during 2004 to 2015 provide support our theoretical predictions. Managerial Summary: Our study intends to enhance the understanding of how external pressure influences a firm's decision to increase the number of female directors on the board. We find that, although external pressure makes firms more likely to increase female directors, firms tend to do it through the addition of board seats rather than through the replacement of incumbent male directors to the extent that the increase is a response to the external pressure. Moreover, we find that new female directors added through addition of board seats are less likely to serve on major board committees than those added through replacement of male directors. These findings suggest that external pressure has a positive but limited effect on countering the gender bias on corporate boards toward female directors. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper examines the demand- and supply-side factors associated with audit partner selection and assignment in the United States. First, we examine whether audit partner gender and experience are associated with board and management gender and experience. Second, we investigate whether engagement audit quality varies with audit partner gender and experience, controlling for selection effects. The results indicate that companies with more gender-diverse boards of directors and top management teams are more likely to have a female lead audit partner. In addition, the experience of the client's board is positively associated with the experience of the lead audit partner. In terms of audit quality, we find that higher audit fees are positively associated with female and more experienced audit partners. Our results shed light on the important role that partner characteristics play in the demand and supply sides of audit quality. (c) 2019 American Accounting Association. All rights reserved.

Research Summary: We employ an exploratory approach to understand what differentiates boards that retain limited, potentially tokenistic, gender diversity (i.e., a single female director), and boards that more genuinely diversify their composition by appointing additional female directors. Previous studies have speculated that strategic leaders responsible for board appointments may influence this occurrence. Using longitudinal data on U.S. firms, we find that more female top managers and having the sole female director serve on the nominating committee increase the likelihood of additional female director appointments. Boards and nominating committees with younger members amplify these effects, respectively. We use interviews with board members and professional corporate governance consultants to discuss the probable causal mechanisms that underpin these relationships, highlighting novel theoretical insights related to gatekeeping and social psychology. Managerial Summary: We explore what compels firms to appoint additional female directors after the first one, as only one female director could be considered a token. Using data on U.S. firms, we find that more female top managers and having the sole female director serve on the nominating committee make firms more likely to appoint additional female directors. These likelihoods are highest when younger directors make up the board at large and/or nominating committee. Chief executive officers can be change agents for gender diversity in their organizations by hiring female top managers and pushing for better representation of women on boards. Likewise, younger directors appear to enhance board gender diversity. These findings can inform the director selection process. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper examines the relationship between boards of directors' demographic diversity and firms' financial performance. In particular, we highlight how women and ethnic minorities can affect Middle Eastern SMEs' financial performance. Using an unbalanced panel of 1,855 firm-year observations of 371 boards of directors from nine Middle Eastern countries, our results support the positive impact of women and ethnic minority group members on Middle Eastern firms' performance. However, our evidence implies that when Western ethnic minority members increase, firms' performances tend to decrease, because these board members are appointed for regional and international board reputation legitimacy, personal business agendas, and links to the external corporate environment.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to verify the influence of the characteristics of boards of directors on the level of environmental disclosure by Brazilian companies. The board is one of the main mechanisms of corporate governance and its characteristics can influence the level of environmental disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a sample of 152 companies listed on the Sao Paulo stock exchange, the BM&FBovespa. The level of environmental information was obtained by conducting a content analysis of company sustainability reports and websites. The generalized additive models based on negative binomial distribution were used to verify the influence of the characteristics of boards on environmental disclosure. Findings: The results indicate that the number of independent board members had statistical significance, suggesting that board independence can improve the control of the administration and encourage greater environmental disclosure. The age variables showed that environmental disclosure increased on boards with average age up to 60 and then decreased. Originality/value: It is expected that this study will contribute to the literature on corporate governance promotion by producing empiric data about the impacts of the characteristics of boards of directors on the level of environmental disclosure of companies that operate in a country with an emerging economy, Brazil. Another contribution may be related to the process of choosing board members because a board of directors must be composed of members with various characteristics to reduce the asymmetry of information and improve a company's environmental disclosure policies.

Purpose: This paper aims to use the passage of the Italian Gender Diversity Law to help isolate the effects of board gender diversity on firm value by investigating conditions under which such diversity provides greater role-enhancing resources to the board. Design/methodology/approach: This paper used a one-day event study to measure when gender diversity matters to investors. Abnormal returns from Italian firms were used to study investors' anticipated outcomes of the effect of gender diversity on firm value. Findings: Board gender diversity is financially beneficial especially for firms with a male dual CEO and board chair and with few or no women on board committees and firms that operate in industries with greater levels of competition. Addition of these moderators more than doubles the variance explained. Moreover, the effect of gender is isolated in this study, which examined investor reaction to the expectation of increases in the number of female board members, rather than to specific female appointees. Social implications: Determining the conditions when a gender diverse matters to firm value is important for shareholders, policymakers and advocates for gender equality. The findings illustrate precise conditions for stakeholders to make the case for board gender diversity as achieving financial reward, in addition to societal benefit. Originality/value: The value of a gender diverse board is contingent on the company's need for diverse resources (e.g. more competition, lack of gender diversity on committees or CEO duality). This paper provides insight as to why prior research linking board gender diversity to firm value finds seemingly contradictory results. Thus, this paper provides useful insights for researchers, boards and legislative bodies. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The authors hypothesize that customer presence in the boardroom of business-to-business (B2B) firms brings customer orientation and customer knowledge to the board of directors and thereby enhances B2B firm performance. Using an objective measure of customer presence in the boardroom and a sample of 329 B2B firms over a nine-year period, the authors find support for this hypothesis. Moreover, relying on the resource-based view, they hypothesize that the performance benefit of customers in the boardroom is contingent on the value, rarity, inimitability, and organizational fit of customer resources. Specifically, they find that a customer on the board is more effective when demand uncertainty is high but is less effective when the firm is highly diversified. Moreover, a board member who is an independent director of the customer firm is less effective than a board member who is an executive at the customer firm. The authors also find that research and development intensity partially mediates the relationship between customer presence on the board and firm performance. (c) American Marketing Association 2018.

This study examines the impact of corporate tax avoidance on board of directors and chief executive officer (CEO) reputation. Our regression results show that when firms engage in tax avoidance, both directors and CEOs, on average, are rewarded by improvements in their reputations as proxied by an increased number of outside board seats. In particular, both independent directors and non-CEO executive directors undergo positive changes in reputation. We also find that CEOs of tax-aggressive firms experience enhanced reputations by gaining extra board seats. Our main regression results hold based on additional analyses. Overall, this study provides important empirical evidence confirming an association between tax avoidance and the individual reputations of directors and CEOs. (c) 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

Research Summary: A number of studies examine the extent to which boards compensate CEOs for their firm's performance (i.e., pay-for-performance), but these studies typically do not incorporate what CEOs actually do to bring about those performance outcomes. We suggest that directors will make stronger internal attributions about firm performance when the CEO engages in high levels of corporate strategic investment. CEOs that invest in firm growth essentially "place their bets," so the pay-for-performance relationship is stronger for them than it is for CEOs who do not invest as much in firm growth. We also theorize and find that directors make internal attributions about firm performance more for prestigious, but not less prestigious, CEOs and more when the directors collectively exhibit conservative, but not liberal, political ideologies. Managerial Summary: Shareholders and other stakeholders often demand that CEOs should be paid for performance. In other words, CEOs should be paid well when the company is performing well and paid less when the company is not performing well. We add an additional dimension: boards might also consider what CEOs actually do to bring about performance outcomes. Our findings suggest that when CEOs make heavy corporate investments, they essentially "place their bets." In this scenario, boards attribute performance to the CEO so that CEO compensation rises and falls with company performance. When CEOs make fewer corporate investments, their compensation is not as strongly associated with company performance. This primary relationship is particularly true when CEOs have high social recognition or when the directors are collectively conservative. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purpose: Boards of directors of large companies all over the world frequently have a certain number of shared directors, which can be motivated by social structures that foster different types of links, including investments and vertical relationships. The purpose of this paper is to identify the effects that board interlocking exerts on innovation, considering the different nature of shared directors that finally determines the type of links dominating the boards. Design/methodology/approach: Panel regression analyses were conducted using data collected from 69 Spanish listed innovative sector companies during the period 2010-2014, which provided an unbalanced panel of 325 data observations. Findings: The results suggested that the typology of interlocks determined their effects on innovation, which had a positive influence when independent and extra-industry directors held multiple directorships, whereas it was negative in the case of intra-industry and women interlocking directors. Practical implications: This study provided evidence for the diverse effects of interlocking directorates and contributed to the open debate on the best board composition for improving business innovation, considering the common feature of shared directorships. Originality/value: The value of this research was twofold. On the one hand, the study considered a wide typology of interlocking directorates, such as women, affiliated and independent directors, intra- and extra-industry directorships, as well as shared directors from the same country. On the other hand, the effects of these different interlocking directorate typologies were analysed on innovation by considering different innovation indicators. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to use the dynamic capabilities framework to explain the effect of board networks, as a source of intellectual capital, on firm performance. The authors propose that the influence of board interlocks depends on their ability to contribute to strategic decision making. As a result, their effect is subject to the business context in which they occur and the different role of the interconnected directors involved. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use social network analysis to make board connections and to calculate centrality measures. The authors also identify busy boards to analyze whether their effect differs from centrality. The authors estimate the theoretical model using the Generalized Method of Moments in order to take advantage of the panel database. Findings: For a sample of Spanish firms from 1999 to 2015, the results show there is no direct significant effect of directors' networks on firm performance. However, the authors find a positive and significant influence of intra-industry board connections, particularly when they are established among outsiders. Research limitations/implications: The Spanish context of the study can limit the generalization of the papers' results. Practical implications: The results can be useful both for practitioners - since they can serve as a guide for companies to reformulate their boards in search of the optimal structure-, and when implementing good governance codes - establishing limits for director interlocking. Originality/value: This study helps to offer a better understanding of how directors' networks can add value to the firm depending on the kind of resources they provide (context) and the role of the director who is connected.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to use insights from role congruity theory to explore how organizational context moderates the relationship between the representation of women on boards and corporate social performance (CSP). Design/methodology/approach: The hypotheses are tested using a panel of S&P 500 firms observed from 2001 to 2011. The authors utilize the generalized estimating equations technique with Heckman's two-stage approach to correct for endogeneity. Findings: The findings reveal that four firm-level variables - voluntary initiative membership, deviation from prior financial performance, internationalization and product diversification - moderate the relationship between the representation of women on boards and CSP. These findings suggest that women directors have the ability to prioritize and advocate for social issues in the boardroom to a greater extent when firms provide a context that values their communal orientation. In contrast, the relationship between women directors and CSP weakens when the context encourages a focus on the bottom line. Originality/value: This study reconciles mixed findings from previous research and contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between women directors and social performance by providing a theory-driven perspective of the circumstances under which women directors have a stronger or weaker impact on CSP. The authors extend role congruity theory by integrating contextual factors that may either diminish or amplify the effects of the expected directors' gender roles on their behavior and decision making.

Although personal attributes have gained recognition as an important area of effective corporate governance, scholarship has largely overlooked the value and implications of individual virtue in governance practice. We explore how authenticity--a personal and morally significant virtue--affects the primary monitoring and strategy functions of the board of directors as well as core processes concerning director selection, cultivation, and enactment by the board. While the predominant focus in corporate governance research has been on structural factors that influence firm financial outcomes, this paper shifts attention to the role of authenticity and its relationship to individual board member qualities and collective board activities. We explore how authenticity has the potential to influence board dynamics and decision making and to enhance transparency and accountability.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of the size and the roles of the board of directors (BD) on two types of innovation namely exploitative and exploratory innovations. These relationships have been little explored in the literature, particularly in developing economies. Using a quantitative approach, an empirical study was conducted on a sample of 51 Tunisian listed companies. It revealed that exploratory innovation is promoted by BDs service role. The results also highlight that exploitative innovation is positively related to the BD's strategy role but negatively associated with BD's control role. The findings do not show a significant effect of BD's size on the two types of innovation. This research provides insights to companies looking to improve their corporate governance practices and develop a sustainable competitive advantage based on innovation.

Purpose: This paper aims to analyze the influence of gender diversity on the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR), corporate governance (CG) and economic and financial performance of Brazilian publicly traded companies. Design/methodology/approach: The sample comprises 68 non-financial public companies comprising the IBX100 index of BM&FBOVESPA. For that, it was used panel data modeling, correlation and ranking by TOPSIS method. Findings: The results suggest a significant relationship between CG and economic-financial performance when mediated by gender diversity. This relationship was not observed between CSR and economic-financial performance. Thus, it can be concluded that in a diversified board of directors, in terms of gender, better monitoring of managers can occur because of the increase in their independence in decisions, as well as performance increase. These results diverge from the literature on the influence of women's participation in corporate boards in CSR. It is assumed that this result is because of the fact that the participation of women is recent in Brazil. Research limitations/implications: The main limitations are the number of companies analyzed, the choice of ISE index to verify the CSR variable and the metric used to verify the CG mechanisms. Originality/value: In general, this research contributes to the literature of the area, especially in Brazil, in confirming that the mediating variable gender diversity makes the relationship between CG and performance more significant.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the differences in men and women, such as risk aversion in decision making, can influence the amount of capital that the board of directors can allocate for investment opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: This study sampled 212 IPOs over the period of 2005-2015 and employed the OLS and the quantile regression techniques to examine the impact of female directors on capital allocation. Findings: The results show that women on corporate boards have a positive influence on the amount of capital an IPO company can allocate for investment opportunities. These findings suggest that the investment strategies of women in an emerging financial market, like Malaysia, may differ from women in other financial markets. Practical implications: The presence of women on corporate boards plays an important role in board involvement in a company's strategic decision at the time of the IPO. Therefore, regulators and IPO issuers should pay close attention to the corporate governance structure of a company at the time of an IPO. In addition, investors and other stakeholders of a company may consider women on corporate boards as an important factor in financing and investment decisions. Originality/value: Despite several studies that have examined the influence of women on corporate boards on corporate outcomes, globally, the presence of women on corporate boards and their influence on corporate decision-making related to allocation of capital to investment opportunities, have not been fully explored in the IPO literature.

This study aims to investigate the influence of board diversity on the performance of firm's corporate social responsibility (CSR) in France, by using five different measures of CSR across 89 Frenchcompanies from 2012 to 2015. The findings revealed that board diversity measured by gender is positively related to (SCR) performance. Moreover, after controlling CEO age and board characteristics, this study finds supporting evidence for a positive association between board diversity and CSR. The findings of the study emphasize the mass theory and are consistent with the argument that board diversity boosts firms' ability to satisfy the need of their stakeholders. The findings also confirm that board diversity is necessary to improve corporate governance. Our results remain robust using different measures of board diversity and methods of analysis.

The awareness of board of directors' role in enhancing firms' financial performance has increased noticeably over the last years. Previous studies, however, have covered a traditional set of characteristics (i.e. board independence, board size and board meetings), but few studies are conducted to explore the impact of a new set of characteristics (i.e. political connections, number of foreign members and busy directors) on banks' performance within the context of emerging markets. This study was motivated to combine the new set of characteristics with the traditional ones to gauge the impact of them on financial performance. Employing an Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression technique on a sample of 14 Jordanian banks listed at the Amman Stock Exchange between 2013 and 2017 revealed that the only variable that has a significant positive impact on financial performance is board size. Busy directors have not obtained the sufficient knowledge and experience or at least they lacked the required time to enhance performance. Politically connected directors as well as foreign members were a stumbling block in the way to positively improve performance. Board meetings and independence were found to be insignificantly associated with return on assets. In a nutshell, the Jordanian regulators need to devote more efforts to revise the suggested characteristics related to boards of directors; since the current composition of boards has been presented as a weak monitoring tool to fulfil principals' goals through enhancing banks' performance.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate what board characteristics affect companies in periods of financial distress (FD) among non-financial Brazilian firms and examine which model best fits to predict FD. Design/methodology/approach: The sample comprises data from 2010 to 2016 of the non-financial Brazilian firms listed on the Brazilian Stock Exchange. To measure this relationship, a conditional logistic regression is performed. Findings: A U-shaped relationship between the size of the board of directors (BD) and FD is found in all models, indicating an optimal number of six members in the BD during the period of FD. However, board characteristics (related to composition and directors' independence) are insufficient to align the shareholders' interests and unsuitable for avoiding or even reducing FD in firms when other factors are neglected. Furthermore, the results reveal what variables provide the best-fitting models to predict FD. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that investigates how the composition of the BD affects the FD likelihood in the Brazilian context. The findings are potentially of interest to researchers and practitioners since this paper contributes to the growing literature on the influence of corporate governance mechanisms in periods of FD and the understanding of its prediction models.

Drawing on the identity fit perspective in organizational identity research, we investigate changes in new director selection patterns for family-influenced (i.e., family identity) and lone founder (i.e., entrepreneurial identity) firms experiencing growth. We collect over 7000 observations of new director placements from 2001 to 2014 and find that both family-influenced and lone founder firms tend to decrease the selection of new directors with similar firm-type board experience as firm size grows and firm performance deviates from that of similar firms. Lone founder firms also decrease the extent to which they hire new directors with previous board experience in lone founder firms following the appointment of a nonfounder CEO. We conclude that while family-influenced firms often use new director selection decisions to maintain the fit between family and firm identity, firm growth creates challenging conditions that threaten family-firm identity maintenance.

Given the vital importance of the board of directors, firms seek to staff their boards with competent individuals who bring valuable skills and expertise to assist a firm. Especially following crises, firms should be interested in appointing directors who possess not only superior decision-making skills under pressure, but who also may be inclined to behave more ethically to prevent future breaches of stakeholder trust. Applying a social identity perspective, we argue that directors with U.S. military experience are decidedly valuable to firms because of their human capital. Using a sample of 144 U.S. based, publicly-traded firms that experienced a Securities Class Action Lawsuit between 2002 and 2012, we test hypotheses predicting that following crises, firms are more likely to appoint directors with military experience. Our findings extend the social identity view of an individual from the self or how individuals view themselves to include how others may view them.

Purpose: This paper aims to draw on insights from team learning theory and stakeholder theory to examine the influence of board composition on firms' stakeholder management practices. The authors posit that board diversity is likely to enhance stakeholder management by shaping organizational goals by placing emphasis on the interests of a wide variety of stakeholders and providing firms with relevant knowledge to enhance their ability manage these interests. The authors further theorize on the moderating role of boards' learning environment, which they conceptualized as an important complementary governance-related factor, likely to further boards' ability to enhance stakeholder management. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test these predictions using the generalized estimating equations (GEE) technique on a panel of S&P 500 firms observed from 2001 to 2011. Findings: The findings provide evidence that more diverse boards in terms of gender, nationality and race/ethnicity are generally associated with more effective stakeholder management. Further, the findings also suggest that boards' co-working experience moderates the relationship between gender and national diversity and stakeholder management. Originality/value: While corporate governance research surveys many strategic implications of board composition, limited attention has been paid to the interplay of board characteristics with stakeholder management. This study is among the first to the authors' knowledge to explore the impact of board diversity on stakeholder management using team learning research, thus drawing attention to the role of boards' co-working experience in shaping their ability to impact firms' outcomes.

Purpose: How do business groups manage their internal processes? The purpose of this paper is to explore how board interlocks between members serve as control and coordination mechanisms within business groups. The authors propose that centrality of groups' affiliates in the group network of interlocking directorates is shaped by agency and resource dependence forces. In particular, the authors examine the role of international board ties as a resource and information conduit. Design/methodology/approach: This study leverages proprietary information on firm-to-firm transaction ties among all 155 affiliates belonging to a large Italian business group. The authors use network analysis to develop multiple measures of the centrality of each group member, and link these to resource transactions, ownership patterns and geographic distributions. The authors test the hypotheses in a structural equation model using LISREL. Findings: The results demonstrate that both resource exchanges and the presence of cross-national relations increase an affiliate's central position in the group's network of board ties. In contrast, ownership ties between members were unrelated to affiliate centrality. Originality/value: Internal governance mechanisms of business groups are rarely studied. While groups are often portrayed as inefficient or value-destroying, the analysis of proprietary firm data suggests a very different scenario: inter-unit ties are much more supportive of a model of business groups as strategic portfolios, using internal ties to share information and resources.

Considerable advances have been made in corporate governance research in recent years and opportunities exist to consider these developments within alliances. We extend the "scope of operations" hypothesis to the domain of joint ventures. This proposition suggests that the monitoring carried out by boards increases when organizations become more complex. The inherent characteristics of JVs generate unique sources of complexity that are currently unexplored in the corporate governance literature. First, we seek to determine their influence on monitoring by using primary data on JV board monitoring. Second, we adopt the size of JV boards as a proxy for monitoring in order to examine whether the determinants of board size and monitoring in fact coincide and to reveal if certain effects are masked by using board size as a simple proxy for monitoring. Doing so enables us to investigate the black-box of what boards actually do as well as extend governance research to other organizational forms. Our findings confirm that the unique characteristics of JVs influence the information needs by the boards resulting in more monitoring by JV directors. Our findings show there is value in bridging alliance theory and the literature on corporate governance research. We also advance practitioner's understanding by providing suggestions on how to structure JV boards in relation to their complexity. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd

We study minority equity partnerships and the representation of investing firms on the boards of directors of their partners. In such alliances, an investor firm owns a minority position in the investee partner and may or may not secure a board seat. Prior alliance governance research has largely focused on the choice between equity and nonequity forms of alliances, and it has paid little attention to the particular administrative features of these organizational forms, notably their governing boards. We extend corporate governance research that has emphasized the monitoring and advisory roles of boards by examining how an investee's concerns about knowledge misappropriation can reduce the likelihood that an investor obtains board representation. We suggest that, although there exist opportunities for an investee to benefit from the investor's advice, the investor's ability to use an investee's knowledge by itself and indirectly with the help of its other partners negatively affects the likelihood of a board seat for the investor. We further argue that this negative effect is amplified when the investee has particularly valuable technologies at risk of appropriation by the investor. Our evidence from minority equity partnerships in the biopharmaceutical industry indicates why and when investors do not obtain board seats, despite the monitoring and advisory benefits that directors can bring to cooperative commercialization agreements.

Corporate governance of banks is important and unique (Levine, 2004). Sound bank corporate governance is a crucial element for promoting a more resilient financial system (FSB, 2013) and sustaining economic growth (BCBS, 2015). A systematic literature review is conducted on the articles published in peer-reviewed academic journals to identify the prevailing results in academic research on bank board characteristics, which is the most investigated topic in bank corporate governance. Based on both theoretical and empirical contributions, findings show that research mainly measures the impact of board characteristics on performance and risks potentially faced by banks, however there is no univocal consensus on the best practices to adopt. Further research is needed to directly investigate other areas of bank corporate governance (such as internal risk management, remuneration and ownership structure).

The entrepreneurial attitude of companies is key to compete in a globalized and dynamic economic environment. Thus, it is of special interest the analysis of the factors that promote or hinder the entrepreneurial orientation (EO) of organizations. In the case of family businesses, the interaction between the family and the business can directly affect the OE, although this effect may vary depending on whether it occurs in the top management team or in the Board of Directors. In addition, the effect of family involvement in both organs may be affected by their respective sizes. Based on a sample of 91 family SMEs, this paper shows the negative effect on OE of a high proportion of family members in the Board and in the top management team, an effect that is reinforced when the number of decision-makers in each organ is greater. This study also finds that the involvement of different family generations in the top management team has a positive effect on EO, decreasing this influence in larger top management teams In addition to the theoretical implications of these findings, the practical implications for managers and owners of family SMEs that are immersed in a period of professionalization are especially interesting. Thus, this study can be helpful in designing the size and the composition of the top management team and the Board of Directors of this type of organization. (c) 2019, Cuadernos de Gestion.
La actitud emprendedora de las empresas es clave para competir en un entorno economico globalizado y dinamico. Por ello, resulta de especial interes el analisis de los factores que promueven o dificultan la orientacion emprendedora (OE) de las organizaciones. En el caso de las empresas familiares, la interaccion entre la familia y la empresa puede afectar directamente a la OE, si bien ese efecto puede variar dependiendo de si se produce en el equipo directivo o en el Consejo de Administracion. Ademas, el efecto de la implicacion familiar en ambos organos puede verse afectada por sus respectivos tamanos. Basandonos en una muestra de 91 pymes familiares, este trabajo demuestra el efecto negativo que sobre la OE tienen una alta proporcion de familiares en el Consejo y en el equipo directivo, efecto que se ve acentuado cuando el numero de decisores en cada organo es mayor. Por su parte, este estudio tambien constata que la involucracion de diferentes generaciones familiares en el equipo directivo tiene un efecto positivo sobre la OE, disminuyendo esta influencia en los equipos directivos mas grandes. Ademas de las implicaciones teoricas que de estos hallazgos se derivan, son especialmente interesantes las implicaciones practicas para los gestores y duenos de las pymes familiares que se encuentran inmersas en un periodo de profesionalizacion. Asi, este estudio puede ser de ayuda a la hora de disenar el tamano y la composicion del equipo directivo y del Consejo de Administracion de este tipo de organizaciones.

By expanding understanding of individuals' reasons to serve on nonprofit boards, practitioners will be able to improve recruitment and retention of quality board members. This study explores board members' reasons for joining and continuing to serve on a volunteer nonprofit board of directors. A survey of nonprofit board members shows similarities in reasons for initially serving and continuing to serve on a board, but analysis of group means reveals significant differences on 20 of 27 dimensions examined. Organizational-level reasons are reported as more important as a result of board service, whereas individual- and community-level items decline in importance after board service. Latent factors that appear to be important for both joining and continuing to serve on a nonprofit board include organizational commitment, personal growth, recognition, and socialness.

We argue that the analysis of multiple political connections in an event study framework can improve the study of institutional change. Based on a unique data set of multiple political relationships of 4,936 South Korean board of director members, we show that the large business conglomerates, the chaebol, did not benefit from the unexpected conservative election victories in the 2012 South Korean parliamentary and presidential elections. Personal connections to the presidential candidates and to the opposition party were relevant for the stock returns of small firms. Our findings suggest that Korea's political economy has evolved into a hybrid regime in which the political power of large multinational corporations is limited, but political connections still matter for smaller firms. The corruption scandal that led to the impeachment of President Park in 2017 and the long-term development of market capitalisation appear to be congruent with the results of our study.

The present research article is an attempt to add something new and revalidate the influence of already existing corporate governance dimensions related to the board of directors on listing-day performance of the Indian initial public offering (IPO) firms measured through underpricing. Like other emerging market economies, firms in the Indian economy are also characterized by concentrated ownership held by an owner or a promoter in the context of the Indian corporate environment. In the backdrop of this concentrated complex ownership structure, the present study analyses the influence of the board of directors on underpricing when the appointment of such directors is largely an affair handled by such owners, whom they are given the task to monitor. The sample consists of 471 IPO firms which went public during the time period from January 2003 to December 2017. Results obtained from the regression analysis show that the board size and board committees act as information signals for Indian IPO firms having a significant and negative relation with listing-day initial excess returns. Other board-related dimensions of governance do not have significant influence on underpricing. Overall board variables have a very miniscule contribution in explaining the underpricing in Indian IPO firms. (c) 2019 XLRI Jamshedpur, School of Business Management & Human Resources.

The objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between directors' remuneration and firm performance among state-owned enterprise (SOE) in Malaysia. In addition, we examine whether board size and government's role moderate the relationship between directors' remuneration and firm performance in SOE. Using panel data regression model on 118 firm-year observations of state-owned enterprise in Malaysia from 2011 to 2013, this study finds there is positive relationship between directors' remuneration and firm performance. The result provides supports that directors' remuneration acts as incentive to board of directors to perform their monitoring task. The result also indicates that larger board size and government play an important role in enhancing firm performance of state-owned enterprise in Malaysia. Nevertheless, when we interact both variables with directors' remuneration, the result indicates that larger board size and political connected directors moderate the positive relationship between firm performance and directors' remuneration. Our result provides evidence that the interaction between directors' remuneration and board size as well as political connected directors explain firm performance among state owned enterprise in Malaysia.

This study considers the effect of foreign board members and age diversity on real earnings management (REM), by controlling the firm size, leverage and growth. This study employed quantitative methodology and longitudinal data for non-financial business firms, quoted on the Amman Stock Exchange from 2011 to 2015. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and Panel Corrected Standard Errors (PCSE) regression. This study found that foreign boards member, age diversity, leverage and growth had negative and significant associations with REM. Based on the results, a firm should appoint young members to the board in addition to older members to pave the way to cross-ideology that can deter REM activities. At least one foreign director should exist within the board of directors because a foreign board member has different qualifications and experiences that may help to deter REM practices.

Despite high female participation in the Thai labour market, female representation on Thai boards of directors is low. This study investigates the effect of female representation on boards of directors on the level of corporate governance in Thailand. The ordered logit regression is applied to a dataset of companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). The main results show that an improvement in corporate governance is associated with a higher ratio of women appointed as board directors. Furthermore, female leadership in the form of chairpersons on executive and audit committees, two important subcommittees, strongly and positively affects corporate governance levels. Finally, the presence of women on a board has a similar effect on corporate governance as that of the presence of independent directors does. The findings offer an insightful introduction to policy makers for promoting female leadership roles on boards to enhance corporate governance. Copyright (c) 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study confirms that a firm's size in the previous year significantly increases board of director compensation in the current year, while the number of directors and the firm's capital expenditure significantly decrease it. On average, 31.2% of restaurant firms overcompensate their board of directors, while 33.8% pay less than the expected amount of compensation to their board of directors. However, contrary to public concern, this study argues that the amounts of over- and under-compensation are negligible in proportion to the directors' total compensation, and thus the issue of over- and under-compensation may not pose a serious problem in the restaurant industry. In particular, the amount of overcompensation has a positive effect on firm growth and capital investment, but does not substantially decrease firms' operational and financial performance. The amount of overcompensation can even have a positive influence on financial performance, although the effect is not statistically significant. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Risk in financial institutions is vitally important to regulators, policy makers, investors, and the stability of the financial system, yet some critical aspects of that risk remain poorly understood. In the case of U.S. startup banks, a critical choice that can influence risk-taking behavior is which of three regulators--with varying levels of stringency--to choose. The board of directors of the new bank makes this important decision, which may result in different risk implications, depending on board's structure. Here, we examine banks' risk behavior associated with the degree of board independence and the choice of regulator. We find that the regulatory environment and board independence jointly influence new bank risk. Our evidence suggests that the intensity of regulatory scrutiny is a partial substitute for board independence in achieving an optimal level of risk. We discuss the implications of our findings for theory and policy. (c) 2018, Springer Nature Limited.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework to examine the relationship among the board of directors' characteristics, internal control mechanisms, and corporate sustainability performance. In particular, it aims to uncover how the board specific characteristics influence internal control, which, ultimately, would enhance the sustainability performance of public listed companies. The premise of the resource dependence theory is utilised to identify the board characteristics that may influence the sustainability performance; namely, size, composition, leadership, ownership, diversity, and expertise. Inspired by the institutional theory, the mediating role of internal control mechanisms, proxied by enterprise risk management (ERM) and management control systems (MCS) is also examined in this relationship. The majority of the previous studies concentrated on a few particular dimensions of sustainability like environmental and social aspects, whereas the governance and economic aspects remain unexplored in the literature. This paper fills this important research gap through holistically conceptualising sustainability performance. (c) 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The emerging markets undergo constant transformations and changes, and thus, a change of strategy can be critical for companies. However, the impact of R&D investment on firm performance and the role of the board of directors that makes decisions about a company's innovative activities remain inconclusive. This paper investigates the relationship between a board of directors' composition and structure in innovative companies and firm performance. Using the panel data of innovative Russian public companies that made R&D investments in 2011-2013, we found a positive relationship between the boards' independence and ROA as an indicator of firm performance. Moreover, it was shown that innovative companies that establish a strategy committee will on average have a higher ROA ratio than innovative companies without such a committee. Innovative firms in emerging markets might consider creating strategic committees and increasing board independence to enhance their performance and increase the number of successful R&D investments.

Extending the proposition that boards of directors influence firms' mergers and acquisitions (M&As), studies have investigated how board interlocks - network ties formed by directors -- may shape M&A processes and outcomes. While board interlocks and M&As are two streams of research, each underpinned by voluminous studies, their cross-fertilization has been relatively limited. In this chapter, the authors take stock of prior research investigating the relationship between board interlocks and M&As. Specifically, emphasizing the network features of board interlocks, the authors highlight a connection aspect and a structure aspect of board interlocks in appreciating their effects during pre-acquisition and post-acquisition phases. Based on this framework, the authors then lay out a research agenda that can further bridge board interlocks with M&As. Overall, this chapter endeavors to integrate and expand our knowledge on the acquisition implications of board interlocks. (c) 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper explores the heterogeneity of board of directors and shareholders involvement in the audit committee in addressing the question of whether the board of directors and audit committee shareholders are effective in suppressing earnings management after the implementation of 2011 revised Code of Corporate Governance in Nigeria. The paper utilized data generated after the implementation of the new Code. It examines explicitly board effectiveness and audit committee shareholder chairman on earnings management in Nigerian financial institutions. The study utilizes a dynamic panel data model of the generalized method of moment (GMM) in analyzing the data. The empirical results suggest that board independence and shareholders as audit committee chair play an essential and a significant negative relationship in curving earnings management. Specifically, the results show that shareholders played effective roles in chairing the audit committee and suppressing the magnitude of earnings management. The results affirmed that the Big 4 relates to lower earnings management. Regulators should consider increasing the number of years shareholders representatives are to serve in the audit committee to continuously improve the quality of the financial reporting process and suppress managers' opportunistic behavior.

Building on research within corporate governance and strategic management, this paper explores how managerial discretion stemming from managerial task environment influences the balance between controlling and enabling managerial decision-making. Two sets of alternative hypotheses about the moderating effects of managerial discretion on the performance effects of board monitoring and CEO human capital were formulated. The results indicate partial support for governance-driven explanation showing that the association between board monitoring and market-based performance is strongest in environments characterized by high levels of managerial discretion. The findings also show that CEO human capital is positively associated with market-based performance in low-discretion environments, while in high-discretion environments this relationship turns negative. The central contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that managerial discretion is a useful tool to explain the balance between controlling and enabling managerial decision making.

Corporate governance of entrepreneurial firms comprises mechanisms through which directors, shareholders, entrepreneurs, and top management teams are involved with start-ups. On the basis of a literature review, we identify three interrelated themes frequently discussed by previous empirical studies: (1) the role of key stakeholders (e.g. directors, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs), (2) governance process (e.g. social networking and strategic decision making), and (3) outcomes of corporate governance (innovation, growth, and internationalization). We augment previous studies' investigations of various stakeholders' roles in corporate governance, by examining the relationships and interactions among various stakeholders or groups of stakeholders, especially between boards and top management teams. We conclude by proposing how future research can explore the effect of interactions between board of directors and top management teams on organizational outcomes. (c) David B. Audretsch, Erik E.

Purpose: New Zealand reintroduced titular honours (i.e. knighthoods and damehoods) in 2009. We document the prevalence of knights and dames on the board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: We use a probit regression to investigate what firm characteristics are significantly associated with having a knight or dame on the board of directors. Findings: We find 19 of 112 companies have a knight or dame on the board. These companies are bigger and have larger and more independent boards than other companies. We also find a knight or dame is more likely to serve in companies that have higher dividend yields. Research limitations/implications: The generalisability of our results is limited by the small number of knights and dames on the boards of listed companies and our archival regression approach. Although we document an association, we cannot prove causation. Originality/value: We show that directors with greater and easily visible reputational capital are more likely to supply their services to companies that mitigate risks to their reputation and protect minority shareholder interests.

The Malaysian government has encouraged the corporate sector to be seriously committed in supporting sustainable development. One of the elements in sustainable development is the inclusiveness of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the corporate sector. FDI plays an important role in the economy as it generates an economic growth by increasing the domestic capital formation and hence, promoting sustainability. This study examines the relationship of corporate governance characteristics on foreign direct investment among property public listed companies in Malaysia. Specifically, this study examines the effect of board of directors' characteristic namely board size, board meeting, board independence and CEO-Chairman duality role on foreign direct investment of the property public listed companies. This study relies on content analysis on the annual reports of 50 public listed property companies in in Malaysia for year 2007-2016. The results show that board meetings and board independency have a significant positive relationship on foreign direct investment of the public listed property companies. However, the results show that board size and CEO-Chairman duality do not have a significant relationship on foreign direct investment of the public listed property companies. The findings in this study implicate the importance of the board of directors' involvement in ensuring effective and efficient decisions related to foreign direct investment. (c) Sciedu Press.

Boards and their directors, a central aspect of the firm's leadership team, find themselves needing to be more accountable than they have ever been before. Accordingly, this chapter considers the corporate board and its ability to create value and to refocus the processes and outcomes of how it is held accountable. Initially, I start by looking at how stakeholder and shareholder views are largely complementary theoretical assumptions, both reflecting a social paradigm associated with the proper roles and responsibilities of firms. I then show how shareholder- and stakeholder-based views can be used to direct boards toward activities that reinforce one another by first outlining two main commonalities of both perspectives - accountability and value - and then illustrating how a board's accountability to both shareholders or stakeholders can lead to value being created in the long term for the other. Lastly, I show how organizational values shape perceptions of how value is created. (c) Joanne B. Ciulla and Tobey K. Scharding 2019.

The purpose of shareholders' involvement in the process of governance is to add corporate value and achieve better governance and firm performance (FP). However, corporate governance (CG) practices can vary from country to country and change over time. This study examines the moderating influence of shareholders' activism (SA) on the CG effectiveness - FP relationship in non-financial companies listed in the Libyan Stock Market between 2007 and 2016. CG effectiveness was the independent variable and consisted of five dimensions: board of directors, monitoring committee, audit committee, nomination and compensation committee, and ownership. Leverage, firm age and firm size were used as control variables. Return on investment was used to assess the corporate performance. SA was tested as a moderating variable using the interactive regression models. The study found out that the CG effectiveness is positively and significantly related to return on investment (beta = 0.608, p < 0.01). This relationship was strengthened by SA (R2 = 0.053, P < 0.05). Overall, the study shows that SA boosts the relationship between CG and FP in the Libyan Stock Market.

The Business Roundtable, a large group of top CEOs, recently issued a statement defining the purpose of the corporation in stakeholder terms, a direct and intended reversal from an earlier statement that defined the duty of directors as serving the interests of stockholders. In this editorial, we briefly describe the major twists and turns in the stockholders-versus-stakeholders debate that make this statement so significant to management theory and practice. We then describe the implications of the statement for scholars and practicing managers. We end with a description of three specific research topics that require more research in light of this statement: firm boundaries, the nature of value creation systems, and theory regarding the destruction of stakeholder value.

Overwhelming evidence from prior research suggests a positive association between corporate board characteristics and carbon performance; however, very little is known about the mechanisms linking the two variables. This study attempts to fill this gap by developing and empirically testing a conceptual model that highlights the role of carbon strategy in the relationship between board environmental orientation (BEO) and carbon performance. We argue that BEO can directly and indirectly influence carbon performance through carbon strategy. Using structural equation modelling to analyse data consisting of 2,301 U.S. firm-year observations over the 2005-2015 period, we find that the greater the BEO is, the better its carbon performance (i.e., lower greenhouse gas emissions). The results also provide evidence of the mediating effect of carbon strategy on the relationship between BEO and carbon performance. Splitting the sample into high and low carbon-intensive industries shows a partial mediation effect in high carbon-intensive industries and a full mediation effect in low carbon-intensive industries. The findings of the study and its implications for scholars, policymakers, managers, investors, and environmentalists are discussed. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the mediating role of board effectiveness (understood as the capacity to efficiently manage and control all functions to guarantee the company's prosperity) in the relationship between board diversity and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use partial least squares methodology to test the direct and indirect relationships between gender diversity in boards of directors and business performance. Findings: Although the relationship between the presence of women on the board and the board's effectiveness is statistically significant, this relationship is negative. However, board effectiveness (measured by the three constructs: strategic control, organizational innovation and decision-making) has a positive and statistically significant effect on business performance. Finally, there is a positive, but not statistically significant, relationship between gender diversity and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: The study has a small sample size, and most of the boards of directors analyzed are unequal with only a few companies achieving gender parity. Social implications: Public institutions must promote actions to achieve a critical mass of women directors and managers, so that women transcend a merely "symbolic" role on a board and are able to develop their skills and characteristics, thereby improving a board's effectiveness and business performance. Originality/value: This paper makes a theoretical contribution to the diversity and governance literature by providing a better understanding of the relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance. It considers the influence of women on the board through a holistic framework, analyzing the mediating role of the board's effectiveness. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We investigate the relation between board gender diversity and firm profitability using the control function (CF) approach recently suggested by Wooldridge (2015). The CF method takes account of the problem of endogenous explanatory variables that have potential to bias the results. Using a sample of firms that made up the S&P 500 over the period 2004-2015, we find that the presence of women on corporate boards (measured either by the percentage of female directors on corporate boards or the Blau index of heterogeneity) has a positive and significant (at the 1% level) effect on firm profitability (measured by the return on assets). We compare our results to more traditional approaches (such as pooled OLS or the fixed-effects model). Through this study, we shed light on the effect of women on corporate boards on firm performance, as it is still a controversial issue (Post and Byron, 2015). (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the link between board of directors' roles namely strategy, service and control roles and ambidextrous innovation. This study also aims to determine whether the independence and gender diversity of boards have mediating effects in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: On the basis of a quantitative approach, the authors conducted a survey on all Tunisian-listed firms. A partial least square method was used to analyze the quantitative data. The authors also conducted semi-structured interviews with a sample of boards' members of the surveyed firms followed by a thematic analysis of the discourses to discuss the results. Findings: Results revealed that ambidextrous innovation is negatively linked to board's control role. The outcomes of this research show also that ambidextrous innovation is positively associated with board's service role and that the gender diversity moderates positively this link. Findings do not indicate a significant relationship between board's strategy role and ambidextrous innovation but show evidence that the relationship is negatively moderated by independent directors, while positively moderated by gender diversity. Originality/value: This research sheds light on the effects of Boards' roles on ambidextrous innovation and the moderating effect of board's gender diversity and independence as well. This paper addresses the gap in the literature as this thematic has not been studied, offering key insights with regard to corporate governance of companies looking to achieve ambidextrous innovation.

We investigate the effect of politically connected boards (both supervisory boards [SBs] and boards of directors [BODs]) on cost of debt and equity capital of listed companies in Indonesia which has established a two-tier corporate governance system. The results, based on 250 firms, suggest that companies with politically connected SBs experience lower cost of debt and equity capital, whereas politically connected BODs have no association with cost of either debt or equity. Furthermore, we find that family firms and firms belonging to business groups with politically connected SBs enjoy lower cost of debt and equity capital. Our main results are robust to alternative measures and to tests for endogeneity. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate the relationship between intellectual capital and corporate governance of Oman's financial sector companies. Intellectual capital has been found to successfully contribute to the economic wealth creation of firms in germane literature. Unfortunately, financial statements do not necessarily capture and reflect the contributions of intellectual capital, thereby leading to an information asymmetry between companies and users of financial statements. The research also investigates the relationship between corporate governance and intellectual capital efficiency across various financial subsectors. Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected from annual reports available on Muscat Securities Market for 31 listed financial sector companies for the period 2012 to 2016 and analyzed using a multiple regression model. Intellectual capital is measured using Pulic's efficiency measure of value-added intellectual coefficient (VAIC). Corporate governance individual components such as board characteristics, audit committee characteristics and ownership structure are presented as independent variables. Findings: The findings suggest that board size and frequency of audit committee meetings have a significant association with the intellectual capital efficiency of Oman's financial sector. VAIC and human capital efficiency of banks are also significantly influenced by most of the corporate governance mechanisms; however, other subsectors do not report such findings. Corporate governance of banks in comparison to other subsectors effectively engages in utilizing the potential of intellectual capital efficiency. Agency theory and resource dependency theory find limited support as a result of this study. The GMM results are not robust to the alternative instruments. Research limitations/implications: The sample size is small as the study is limited to the listed financial sector of Oman. Future studies can be extended to include all of Oman's or GCC's listed companies. Additionally, the intellectual capital is measured using the construct of VAIC which suffers some limitations and can be overcome using other tools such as content analysis. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that Oman's regulators can create an awareness strategy on highlighting the importance of intellectual capital for companies (board of directors and managers), investors, debtors and creditors. Further, Oman's Capital Market Authority and Muscat Securities Market need to strengthen the regulations related to intellectual capital. Originality/value: This study extends intellectual capital and corporate governance literature by presenting the research outcome for Oman's financial sector. It is useful for Oman's financial sector companies to direct corporate governance measures for driving value creation of firms through the management of intellectual capital efficiency.

This study investigates the impact of female directors (FDs) on investment efficiency in a competitive environment. Considering Chinese market, where corporate governance practices are weaker than other developed countries and empirical evidence regarding the role of female directors in shaping investment efficiency is absent, this study fills this gap by studying the role of the female directors in investment efficiency in a competitive environment. The results show that FDs improve the investment efficiency in the firms as they play a monitoring role, discipline the management, reduce agency problem, and improve efficient allocation of resources. The results also exhibit that FDs significantly curb the overinvestment problem. However, FDs do not play a significant role in reducing underinvestment problem. The study facilitates to understand the factors that help in efficient allocation of resources in an economy. This study can be helpful for the policymakers while devising corporate policies to promote and encourage gender diversity in higher management. (c) 2019, Eurasia Business and Economics Society.

This paper examines the influence of the size of firms' board of directors on corporate social performance through a meta-analytic perspective. To that end, a sample of 80 articles that draw on evidence from more than 80,000 international companies, published between 1997 and 2018, was examined. This paper analyzes the moderating effect of a set of corporate governance mechanisms such as board composition and corporate governance systems on the hypothesized relationship between the size of firms' board and corporate social performance. Our central results reveal that larger and more independent boards better represent stakeholders' sensitivities and allow companies to achieve their social objectives. Moreover, that connection is more positive and stronger in companies with more independent boards and in countries that have codified law, which often have fewer mechanisms to protect shareholders' interests.

Research Question/Issue: The role of the board chair has become increasingly complex in recent decades. Research on corporate governance has called for and has initiated the pursuit of more research for the purpose of creating a better understanding of the role of board chairs. We reviewed 234 academic articles published in 66 journals, structured the existing research according to an Input-Process-Outcome-Contexts framework, and provided a future research agenda for studies on the role of the board chair. Research Findings/Insights: Our review reveals that the number of published studies on the position of the board chair has grown over the last two decades. Although extant research is dominated by quantitative studies exploring the impact of the board chair position on financial performance, frequently drawing on agency and stewardship theory, recent work has moved beyond this focus and has added valuable insights. The Input-Process-Outcome-Contexts framework used to structure the extant research reveals that future research should pursue topics related to all components of the framework and that opportunities exist to draw from a broader set of theories. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Based on the framework, we formulate seven specific research topics that can add valuable insights into the role of the board chair and suggest theories that can help inform research pursuing these topics. Taken together, these topics have the potential to create valuable insights into how board chairs are appointed, develop competencies, and interact and work with the CEO, the top management team, the board, and other stakeholders while acknowledging the influence of contextual factors, such as ownership, diversity, the firm's development stage, and external events and trends. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our review shows a growing global movement toward prescribing more corporate governance regulations and separating the positions of the board chair and the CEO. We show that many aspects need to be considered when choosing a governance configuration and when appointing a board chair because this role is becoming increasingly demanding.

Purpose: This study aims to draw on the resource dependence theory to synthesize the conflicting arguments as well as commonalities of the agency and stewardship perspectives on the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: Multiple regression analysis is used to analyze the data collected from a sample of 212 large-scale publicly listed companies representing 20 sectors in the Colombo Stock Exchange in Sri Lanka. Findings: The research results based on all of 212 publicly listed companies in Sri Lanka show, in support of the agency theory, that CEO duality exerts a negative effect on firm performance when the CEO is equipped with additional informal power. Conversely, CEO duality exhibits a positive effect on firm performance when board involvements are high, a finding that supports the commonalities of the agency and stewardship theoretical perspectives. Practical implications: By examining the governance practices and concepts in an Asian developing economy, this study provides insight into the power dynamics between the CEO and the board of directors in managerial contexts that are largely different from those in western countries. Originality/value: This study expands the theoretical underpinning of corporate governance research by identifying the performance implications of CEO duality within the broad context of the resource provision of the board of directors and the informal power of CEOs.

Business and politics are now more connected than ever. In Canada, more than 50% of listed companies have political connections through the board of directors or top management. These ties can give companies the resources they need to achieve their goals and possibly even confer a substantial advantage that results in better financial performance. To this end, political connections must influence the various choices and behaviours of politically connected companies, such as their voluntary disclosure strategy. As this type of influence has rarely been investigated in the literature, the current study looks at the impact of board and top management political connections on the voluntary disclosure behaviour of Canadian firms. Four types of voluntary disclosure--environmental, social, governance and total--are analyzed. Results show that politically connected companies make broader voluntary disclosures than non-connected firms do. Board and top management political connections are positively and significantly related to total voluntary disclosure, and board political connections are positively and significantly related to governance disclosures. In addition, top management political connections are positively and significantly related to voluntary environmental and social disclosures. This study is the first to shed light on the link between political connections and the voluntary disclosure of Canadian listed companies, as well as the first to confirm that not all political connections are equal. The impact of these connections on companies' choices and behaviours can differs according to the politically connected actor's position in the company, including on the board of directors or in top management. This difference could be explained by the fact that while board are generally concerned about strategic issues, top management deal with operational aspects. Consequently, they may not have the same behaviours and choices. (c) 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate whether female directors have an effect on company financial performance in a patriarchal emerging country that has a collectivistic culture with a substantial gender equality gap and is characterized with a paternalistic management culture. In addition, it aims to investigate whether the affiliations of female directors matter performance-wise in a setting where the majority of the companies are ultimately controlled by large business groups including families. Design/methodology/approach: The current study uses a unique hand-collected data set that covers all non-financial public companies quoted at the Borsa Istanbul between the years 2009 and 2017. To investigate the relationships between the presence and ratio of female directors and company financial performance, the current study uses the pooled ordinary least squares method, as well as the firm-fixed effects method to overcome potential omitted variables problems and various generalized method of moments methods to overcome potential reverse causality problems. Findings: The findings of the current study demonstrate that the presence and percentage of female directors both have a positive effect on company financial performance in a cultural setting where the opposite might be expected. They also present evidence suggesting that the effect becomes larger as the level of the independence of female directors becomes greater. Originality/value: The current study demonstrates that the presence of female directors on boards has a positive effect on company financial performance, even in a cultural setting that is very different from those of countries where the majority of previous studies on female directors are conducted on. In addition, it demonstrates how company financial performance varies with the level of the affiliation of female directors. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to reexamine the link between board racial diversity and firm performance. It focuses on the mechanism through which board racial diversity could affect performance. The paper proposes and empirically tests the role of employee productivity and R&D productivity in the relationship between board racial diversity and firm financial performance. Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a mediation analysis framework with the bootstrapping method to test both the direct and indirect effect of board diversity on firm performance. The data used in the study come from S&P 1500 with variables composed from COMPUSTAT, Institutional Shareholder Services and Wharton Research Data Services. Findings: Contrary to prior findings, the results indicate that there is neither direct effect of board racial diversity on firm performance nor is there an indirect effect through either employee productivity or R&D productivity. Research limitations/implications: Because the data used in the paper are based on large public firms, the results may not generalize to small or private firms. Practical implications: The findings of the paper suggest that not all diversity measures matter in the same way and firms should carefully make board appointments to reduce the perception that they select directors for any reason other than qualifications. Originality/value: The paper advances the literature on board diversity by examining two previously unexplored mediating variables of employee productivity and R&D productivity. It also uses more rigorous mediation analysis with bootstrapping method and a validation sample to improve robustness of the results. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The paper examines the influence of corporate governance (CG) and earning quality (EQ) on corporate value (FV) of Vietnamese enterprises. The study uses GLS regression and linear structure model using data collected from companies listing on the stock market in Vietnam during 2008-2018, with a total of 2,937 observations. The research results indicate that EQ and CG represented by the Integrated Board of Directors and the Integrated Supervisory Board have a positive effect on FV directly and indirectly. The results show that the Integrated Board of Directors has a positive effect on EQ, whereas the Integrated Supervisory Board has a negative effect on EQ. Based on the research results, we suggest that companies need to strictly comply and implement GC, so to bring down the agency cost and consequently to increase performance. The companies also should establish the Board of Director of a proper size, with financial and accounting specialty, and including women board members. The government also needs to improve the management mechanism asking for firms to prepare and publish financial statements with reliable company information, which could be provided to users. These recommendations are a useful basis to help businesses improve FV via changes in the corporate governance factors in each enterprise. (c) The Author(s).

Purpose: This study aims at examining the level of risk of disclosure practices and the effect of four board of directors' characteristics (board size, board meetings, CEO duality and board expertise) on these practices in the Jordanian context. This study also adds to the body of literature by examining the moderating effect of family ownership on the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and the corporate risk disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: The sample of this study contains the non-financial Jordanian firms listed on Amman Stock Exchange (ASE). 376 annual reports of the sampled firms over four years from 2014 to 2017 were used. The content analysis approach was used to collect data and to determine the level of risk disclosure by computing the number of risk-related sentences in the annual reporting. To test the study's hypothesis, the random effect model was employed. Findings: The empirical results show that the total of the risk disclosure sentences for each firm ranges from a minimum value of 2 sentences to a maximum value of 61 sentences, and the mean of CRD is 28 sentences. The results also indicate that the board expertise is positively related with the level of risk disclosure. Conversely, CEO duality has a negative impact on the risk disclosure practices. However, the results failed to support that the board size and the board meetings have a significant effect on the level of risk disclosure. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that the family ownership moderates the relationship between the board of directors and the corporate risk disclosure. Practical implications: The finding of this study is more likely be useful for many concerned parties, researchers, authorities, investors and financial analysts alike in understanding the current practices of the risk disclosure in Jordan, thus helping them in reconsidering and reviewing the accounting standards and improving the credibility and transparency of the financial reports in the Jordanian capital market. Originality/value: The current study contributes to the literature of risk disclosure because the previous research has paid little attention to this topic in Jordan. To the best knowledge of the researcher, this study is the first Jordanian study that focuses on examining the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and the corporate risk disclosure in the non-financial sector. Furthermore, it is the first study that examines the moderating role of family ownership on such relationships. Consequently, the results of the current study draw attention to the CRD practices and the monitoring role of board of directors in Jordan. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This work seeks to contribute to the debate about whether or not family businesses are more innovative than other kind of companies, and explore the specific effects women on boards have on innovation, comparing family and non-family businesses. Data collected from Spanish listed companies belonging to innovative sectors between 2003 and 2017 confirm that being a family business impacts positively on the number of registered patents and the proportion of women on boards exert a positive influence on R&D and patents. Moreover, the proportion of women on boards influences innovation in a different way when family and non-family businesses are compared, and depending on whether female directors belong or not to the family of control. Therefore, the results obtained suggest some relevant recommendations for research and practitioners, providing new insights into the debate on the benefits of family companies for innovation and of gender diversity of their boards.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of gender diversity among the board of directors (BOD) and Shariah supervisory board (SSB) members on the financial performance of Islamic banks in Indonesia and Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: Data for a sample of 19 Islamic banks for the period 2010-2018 were collected to test the research hypotheses using pooled ordinary least squares estimation method. Generalized least squares estimation method was used to confirm that the results are robust. This study lagged the explanatory variables by one period to control for potential endogeneity. Findings: The findings suggest that Islamic banks with more gender-diverse BOD and SSB are expected to have better financial performance. In addition, this paper finds that an increase in Islamic banks' size may undermine the positive impact of gender diversity among SSB members on Islamic banks' financial performance. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted only on Islamic banks in Indonesia and Malaysia owing to data constraints; thus, the results may not be generalizable to Islamic banks in other countries. Practical implications: Improving financial performance is crucial for banks, especially for Islamic banks, to sustain their fast-growing share globally. Therefore, the findings of this study are expected to provide insight and understanding in the selection and appointment of BOD and SSB members at Islamic banks. Social implications: By having women represented in the BOD and SSB, Islamic banks will benefit equally from valuable abilities across demographic groups in the society. Furthermore, if the members of the BOD and SSB are properly selected, Islamic banks with more gender-diverse boards can effectively contribute to enhancing social welfare of various segments in the society. Originality/value: This is the first study, as far as is known to the authors, that provides empirical evidence on the influence of gender diversity among BOD and SSB members on the financial performance of Islamic banks. This paper is expected to be used as a reference by the shareholders and customers of Islamic banks in ensuring that the BOD and SSB have the best optimal composition that maximizes their profits.

Drawing on resource dependence theory and group diversity research, this paper examines how board gender and racial diversity impact corporate divestitures. We argue that due to the diverse experiences, knowledge, and perspectives that female and racial minority directors bring to the boardroom, it is more difficult and time-consuming for the board to reach a consensus and pursue a common course of action. Consistent with this argument, our results indicate that board gender and racial diversity lead to longer divestiture completion times and a lower divestiture rate. Additionally, we argue that due to their cognitive heterogeneity, diverse boards likely exchange a greater variety of information, engage in more thorough discussions, and implement greater oversight of divestitures, leading to more positive divestitures returns. Offering mixed support for this argument, we found that while gender diversity increased divestiture returns, racial diversity was associated with lower divestiture returns. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

During recent years, there has been a growing interest in CEO narcissism across disciplines. Various scholars document that CEO narcissism is an important factor that should not be overlooked when analyzing various organizational outcomes and strategies. Research on CEO narcissism has focused on its negative implications on organization outcomes. However, little attention has been paid to its effect on corporate social responsibility (CSR). This study explores the relationship between CEO narcissism and two distinct facets of CSR (stakeholder management and social issue participation), while taking into account the moderating role of outside board of directors. Using a sample of publicly traded U.S restaurants, the results document that an outside board of directors plays a moderating role on the relationship between CEO narcissism and the two distinct facets of CSR.

Corporate governance research suggests that boards of directors play key roles in governing company strategy. Although qualitative research has examined board-management relationships to describe board involvement in strategy, we lack detailed insights into how directors engage with organizational members for governing a complex and long-term issue such as product innovation. Our multiple-case study of four listed pharmaceutical firms reveals a sequential process of board involvement: Directors with deep expertise govern scientific innovation, followed by the full board's involvement in its strategic aspects. The nature of director involvement varies across board levels in terms of the direction (proactive or reactive), timing (regular or spontaneous), and the extent of formality of exchanges between directors and organizational members. Our study contributes to corporate governance research by introducing the concept of board behavioral diversity and by theorizing about the multilevel, structural, and temporal dimensions of board behavior and its relational characteristics.

Purpose: Human capital has been traditionally viewed in terms of how an individual's investment in knowledge, skills and abilities can lead to higher pay or promotions. More recently, human capital has been regarded as a unit-level resource using the term "human capital resources" to consider the aggregate effects of human capital. The purpose of this paper is to examine the collective human capital present in a firm's board of directors as a valuable resource leading to superior firm outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: The study examined the effects on firm innovation of the scientific expertise of corporate directors, average board tenure and the presence of a firm's founder on the board. Data from a sample of pharmaceutical firms were analyzed with the dependent variable, innovation, measured as patent applications and both individual and unit-level human capital measures of the predictor variables. Findings: The results show that the presence of a founder-director is positively related to innovation and more pronounced when combined with the board's scientific expertise. Board tenure shows a relationship to innovation and is more evident in combination with the board's aggregate level of scientific expertise. The effect of directors' scientific expertise is also greater when measured at the board level of scientific expertise. Research limitations/implications: Future studies should examine these relationships within a broader context extending the research to other industries thereby incorporating wider variation in both the antecedents and measures of innovation. In addition, future studies might investigate a likely non-monotonic relationship of board tenure with strategic outcomes, recognizing the non-linear nature of effects of board tenure. Practical implications: In addition to the theoretical and empirical implications, this research may also inform practicing managers charged with constituting their boards of directors and provide some guidance for the recruitment and retention of board members. The research may also assist top managers and investors in knowing when the presence of a founder on the board is useful and supportive of the firm's strategic direction. Originality/value: The study extends scholarly understanding of human capital theory beyond the top management team to boards of directors demonstrating the importance not only of directors' individual capital but also how it combines with that of other directors. Moreover, it enhances understanding of board characteristics beyond the bounds of demographic characteristics to show that additional qualities affect firm strategy. This research also informs managers, boards and investors how boards might be more effectively constituted to impact firm strategy. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The purpose of this study is to understand the dynamic relationships between managerial human capital, dynamic managerial capabilities and strategic change within boards of directors. Building on the dynamic managerial capabilities perspective and upper echelons theory, we theorize and investigate the impact of managerial human capital on strategic change as well as the mediating role of boards' sensing, seizing and reconfiguring abilities, defined as dynamic managerial capabilities. The hypotheses are tested on a sample of 606 Norwegian firms. The main findings suggest that while managerial human capital positively impacts strategic change, boards' sensing and seizing abilities (not reconfiguring) positively mediate the relationship between human capital and strategic change. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the effect of royal family members on firm performance of publicly listed companies in Saudi Arabia. Design/methodology/approach: Using 491 firm-year observations of non-financial publicly listed firms in Saudi Arabia's stock market between 2009 and 2013, the study employs, besides others, the advanced econometric technique GMM-system estimator. This allows the dynamic nature and control of the endogeneity problem to be accounted for in corporate governance and firm performance. Findings: The main result is that the attendance of royal family members at board meetings negatively influences firm performance but does not have an influence on firm value. The results also show that firms with many independent royal family members on the board of directors have better firm performance and firm value. In addition, firms with a high number of royal family members presenting on the board have better firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This study offers guidance to assist the further investigation of the SA Royal Family's BoD membership either in SA or in other monarchy countries. It is interesting to compare these results in order to further understand the different effects that the Royal Family's BoD membership have in such countries. This study's results suggest that independent members of SA's Royal Family on the BoD have some influence on firm performance in both the short and long term. Thus, policymakers should encourage the members of SA's Royal Family to become more involved in firms' BoDs. Practical implications: This study offers guidance for further investigation of royal family members in the region or in other monarchy countries. It will be interesting to compare these results. The study suggests that royal family members on the board have a partial influence on firm performance, especially the independent ones. Thus, the policymakers should encourage more involvement of independent royal family members on the board. Social implications: Foreign and minority investors, who invest in SA's publicly listed firms, should note that when independent members of SA's Royal Family are on the BoD their investment will benefit from the reduced risks and uncertainty. Originality/value: To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first study undertaken to investigate empirically the influence a royal family's presence on the board of directors has on firm performance. This study is based on both theories, namely the agency theory and resource dependence theory. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study explores how board leadership may influence the board dynamic managerial capabilities. We draw on the dynamic capabilities perspective to examine the effect of board chairs on the dynamic managerial capabilities of the board of directors. Using survey data from a sample of 410 Norwegian firms, our results reveal that board chair human capital is positively related to the board's sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring capabilities. Moreover, we find the positive effects of board chair human capital on board sensing and seizing capabilities to be stronger under higher environmental dynamism. Our study suggests that board chairs can play an important leadership role in developing dynamic managerial capabilities at the board level, particularly in more dynamic environments.

The aim of this paper is to bring together some of the foundational and recent literature interlinking corporate governance and the leadership role of the board of directors. Strategic leadership is widely assumed to be a responsibility that defaults to the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). However, in practice, what most CEOs do is strategic management rather than strategic leadership. While strategic management does share key aspects of strategic leadership CEOs are expected to prioritize the managerial side over the leadership side. This is just one of the situations in which the boardroom assumes the leadership role. This paper discusses how boards of directors conduct the process of strategic leadership in their organizations. In recent years there has been an increasing interest among scholars to understand how boards strategize from a behavioral point of view. This growing interest has resulted in the development of various typologies regarding boards' involvement in the strategic leadership processes.

This study examines the effect of Islamic banks' dual board governance mechanisms (Shariah supervisory board and regular board of directors) on technical efficiency; and whether the effect of such governance mechanisms varies between normal times and global financial crisis period. The results show that Shariah supervisory board contributes to reducing an Islamic bank's technical inefficiency. During the GFC, both SSB governance and regular board governance generate an incremental efficiency gain to Islamic banks, but the effect is more pronounced for SSB governance. The key findings on the governance-inefficiency relationship are robust to controlling for potential endogeneity of corporate governance. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Managerial oversight is strengthened and firms' strategic performance improved when boards are gender-diverse. Yet the rate of women's appointment to corporate boards is decelerating. This study proposes an explanation for the unexpected attenuation rooted in social movement dynamics, particularly cross-movement influences originating from the contemporary governance reform movement. Seeking to alleviate managerialist tendencies, the governance reform movement has compelled major changes to board structure, composition, and activity, as well as the broader logic surrounding corporate boards. By definition, social movements' cognitive and structural advances manifest "spillover" effects - unintentional impacts affecting the opportunity structure, and ultimately progress, of neighboring campaigns. Drawing on social movement theory, a conceptual model is outlined explicating the mechanisms by which governance reform's broad enactments have incidentally impeded board gender diversity's advance. Theoretically-grounded strategies for reversing those effects are also outlined and the study closes with a discussion of implications for research, practice, and policy. (c) 2020

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess whether the gender composition of the board of directors affects the sensitivity to gender issues in defining university strategies and therefore strategic plans. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted an ordinary least square regression to test the relationship between gender sensitivity approach and board composition in Italian state universities (ISUs). The authors measured the gender sensitivity approach of each university by an index (gender sensitivity approach index) determined based on content analysis. Gender board composition is, instead, analyzed by heterogeneity (homogeneity) index (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) of the board. Findings: The finding suggests that, if the board has a certain level of heterogeneity, then university strategic plan (USP) is a more gender-sensitive approach. Research limitations/implications: The study analyses only the 2018 USPs of ISUs and considers the presence of women within the board, and not their actual role and their position in the university hierarchy. Practical implications: The practical implication of this study is that if universities want to guarantee gender equality, they should open their boards more widely to women. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that analyzes the relationships between board composition and sensitivity to gender issues within the USPs. The paper therefore contributes to the literature on governance in the public sector, particularly in universities. Moreover, it stimulates the accounting debate on gender issue and highlights that gender issues cannot be taken up by decision-making bodies that are not heterogeneous enough.

Research Summary: Board scholarship has generally taken the perspective that when it comes to board expertise, more is better. This study, in contrast, explores contingencies that may stretch board experience beyond the limits of its usefulness. We integrate insights from extant research in board leadership and international strategy to identify and test internal and external contextual factors that can limit the effectiveness of boards' international experience. Exploring this in the context of cross-border M&As, we find evidence that the positive effects of boards' international experience are attenuated when the CEO lacks such knowledge, and when the institutional distance between the home and target countries is high. Overall, our findings suggest the need to exercise caution in viewing board expertise as a "panacea" of board effectiveness. Managerial Summary: Boards are generally viewed as experts that CEOs can look to for advice when formulating corporate strategy. Accordingly, the predominant view has been that the more relevant expertise on the board, the better the strategic advice they can offer. The results of our study, however, suggest that is not always the case. As it pertains to cross-border M&As, in order to get the maximum benefit from boards' international experience, CEOs must have enough international experience of their own, and the institutional environment of the target firm's country must not be too dissimilar from the acquiring firm's home country. Otherwise, it is possible that the boards' international experience will be stretched beyond its strategic usefulness. (c) 2020 Strategic Management Society

This paper explores the development and articulation of the agency and stakeholder theories of the firm and their corresponding logics of shareholder wealth maximisation and stakeholder interest optimisation. We note how these two perspectives have been viewed as diametrically opposite normative, instrumental and descriptive theories, despite efforts by some authors to find common ground. Each has served as a basis for firm governance. We explore the relationship of the agency and stakeholder theories to the conceptualisations of the roles of boards of directors, and how both theories hold value in understanding two board functions/roles: control/monitoring roles and service roles (which covers both resources and strategy).

This study investigates the effect of three categories of factors on the decision by financial companies to adopt the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). These factors are linked to (i) resources available to the firm (ii) the search for legitimacy and (iii) governance. Univariate and multivariate analyses are applied on a sample of 198 financial firms between 2006 and 2015. The results show that financial companies that are more likely to become PRI signatories have fewer available slack resources, are more scrutinized by the public, are bigger and have a board of directors characterized by greater gender diversity and independence than nonsignatory companies.

While boards of directors play a critical role in the formulation of strategic actions of family firms, up-to-date research examining the antecedents of boards' influence on strategic decisions remains limited. This study examines whether and how boards' task conflict impacts boards' control and advisory tasks, as well as to what extent these relationships vary with different degrees of boards' openness. Our main hypotheses are tested on a sample of 94 family firms from Norway. Our main findings confirm the complex and context-sensitive nature of conflicts in the context of family firms' boards of directors. In particular, we advance the debate by suggesting that task conflict benefits both boards' control and advisory tasks only when boards function in an atmosphere of openness. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

The governance of non-profit organisations is complex, as these organisations are not only intended to create value for third parties but also dependent on their donors. When the donor is a for-profit firm, it may be challenging to align and balance the firm's for-profit interests and the non-profit organisation's social aims. The board of directors has the main responsibility for supporting and monitoring managers' decisions so that all perspectives are considered, but doing so requires appropriate information about stakeholders' expectations. Adopting the agency theory perspective, this study focuses on corporate governance in corporate foundations (CFs), a type of non-profit organisation with a private firm as its founder and main donor. We hypothesise that bureaucratic control and coordination mechanisms between CFs and their founder firms, which are the main donors and consequently the main stakeholders, can increase the involvement of the board of directors, thereby leading to higher organisational effectiveness. We argue that the implementation of bureaucratic control and coordination mechanisms between a CF and its founder firm can strengthen corporate governance and provide the board of directors with the information needed to be more involved; such implementation fosters organisational effectiveness because it aligns the profit-oriented objectives of the founder firm and the social-oriented objectives of the CF. By analysing data from interviews of 188 CFs from six European countries, we aim to contribute to the debate on the role of corporate governance in non-profit organisations under the agency theory perspective. We provide evidence that the implementation of coordination and bureaucratic control mechanisms between a CF and its founder firm gives the board more information and leads to higher board involvement, thereby minimising agency issues and fostering organisational effectiveness.

Purpose: From the agency theory's point of view, this paper aims to analyze corporate governance mechanisms about the characteristics of the companies quoted in the segments Bovespa Mais and Bovespa Mais 2 and their influence on the creation of value in preparation for the opening of the initial public offering (IPO). Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach was adopted to achieve the proposed objective using the panel data with fixed effects and secondary data collected on the Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios website, using statistical software Stata(r) 13.0 for statistical tests. The population comprises non-financial companies belonging to the Bovespa Mais and Bovespa Mais Level 2 groups, as the survey sample took into account the period of adhesion of the companies, totaled in 15 companies, which cover the period from 2008 to 2019. The selected variables correspond to the ownership structure's characteristics, then the board's composition and the fiscal council as the body responsible for supervising the administrators' acts. Findings: The main results indicate that the number of independent members on the board of directors and the supervisory board's participation positively influence market performance. However, it also reveals that the concentration of ownership brings fundraising for other companies' acquisitions, risk reduction concerning information asymmetry between investing powers. Research limitations/implications: The main results indicate that the number of independent members on the board of directors and the supervisory board's participation positively influence market performance. Despite this, it also reveals that the concentration of ownership brings fundraising for other companies' acquisitions, risk reduction concerning information asymmetry between investing powers. Practical implications: This paper advances a comparative institutional perspective to explain capital market choice by firms making an IPO in a foreign market. This paper finds that internal governance characteristics (founder-chief executive officer, executive incentives and board independence) and external network characteristics (prestigious underwriters, degree of venture capitalist syndication and board interlocks) are significant predictors of foreign capital market choice by foreign IPO firms. Social implications: While product market choices have been central to strategy formulation for firms in the past, financial markets' integration makes capital markets an equally crucial strategic decision. This paper advances a comparative institutional perspective to explain capital market choice by firms making an IPO in a foreign market. Originality/value: This situation generates value to shareholders and is perceived by the market and, ultimately, generates a direct relationship with the market performance of companies. While product market choices have been central to strategy formulation for firms in the past, financial markets' integration makes capital markets an equally major strategic decision.

This study provides pioneering empirical evidence on board gender diversity and firm performance relationship for the case of large-scale agri-food companies in Russia. While Russia plays an important role in the global food security, its domestic agri-food production is heavily dependent on large scale producers. Our findings suggest a strong positive link between the percentage of female directors in boardrooms and firm performance. Moreover, in line with critical mass theory, boards with three or more female directors have greater impact on firm performance compared to boards with two or less female directors. Further analysis shows that the presence of female directors in the company has a positive impact on firm performance, mainly due to their executive, rather than monitoring effects. The paper shed light on gender diversity of Russian corporate boardrooms and provides empirical recommendations for policy makers as well as corporate executives in Russia. (c) 2019 Tleubayev et al.

High-growth firm is the research object of economic and business studies, because of its important influence on job creation, innovation, and tax revenues increase for the nation. This paper is designed to find some empirical evidence on the role of corporate governance on the firm's growth, thereby providing some policy implications for improving corporate governance activities in practice. Using a sample of 241 listed companies on Vietnam's stock market in the period 2008-2017, divided into 2 groups: high-growth firms and non-high-growth firms and applying a GMM regression with the dependent variable as 3-year compound growth rate, the study finds evidence of factors affecting the growing ability of corporate governance, namely: the ownership structure, the characteristics of the Board of Directors (size, independence, gender, non-executive member, experience), and the characteristics of the CEO (age, educational level, ownership, duality).

Despite the association between the board of directors and firm performance having been examined extensively in the literature, empirical evidence on whether and how boards contribute to firms' long-term success is scarce. Using 14-year panel data of all Australian listed firms, this study examines the effects of board potential and board dynamics, the key factors of board effectiveness, on firms' investment efficiency. We find strong evidence that both board potential and board dynamics are positively associated with firm investment efficiency. The findings support the view that both firms' resources and internal processes that enable boards to mobilize those resources to resolve complex tasks are critical for a firm's long-term success.

Purpose: This paper attempts to examine the activity and involvement of board of directors in internationalization activities of firms in emerging markets, by evaluating the resource provisioning roles of interlocks provided by board of directors, and the frequency of board meetings. We demonstrate that the effectiveness of board involvement is contingent upon the levels of family ownership in firms since family ownership could impact the firm's ability to utilize the presence of different types of board members. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test our hypotheses on a sample of listed Indian companies, extracted from the Prowess database published by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), a database of the financial performance of Indian companies. On a panel of 3,133 firm years of 605 unique Indian firms with foreign investments, over a time period of 2006-2017, the authors apply different estimation techniques. Findings: The results demonstrate that both board meeting frequency and director interlocks are instrumental in supporting internationalization activities in emerging market firms. However, family ownership moderates the role of insider and independent interlocks on internationalization investments in different ways; the authors find that interlocks provided by independent directors support internationalization activities in family firms, whereas those provided by insider directors do not. Further, the study also finds that board meetings are less effective in internationalization of family firms. Practical implications: The authors conclude that family firms aiming at international diversification require to develop more connected and networked independent directors to enable internationalization in firms. While independent director interlocks enhance the international investments, it is also useful to know that board meetings are ineffective in utilizing the resources in family firms. This points to the possibility that family firms should device mechanisms to integrate family meetings with board meetings so that they can utilize the within-family processes to aid in their internationalization decisions. Originality/value: The study contributes to resource dependence theory by understanding its limiting role in family firms. Theoretically, it helps delineate the limiting resource provision role of the insider directors vis-a-vis independent directors. The authors argue that the resource provision role of insider director interlocks does not effectively help in internationalization in comparison to independent director interlocks in family-dominated firms. Consequently, the study shows the limiting role of resource provision and utilization by family-owned firms in comparison to non-family-owned firms. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Based on the resource dependency theory, this article investigates the relationships among board gender diversity, innovation, and firm performance. Specifically, this article examines the mediating role of innovation, which may explain how board gender diversity is related to firm performance. Using a sample of 120 SBF companies from 2009 to 2012, the results indicate a negative effect of board gender diversity on innovation. In addition, we do not find evidence of a mediating role of innovation within the board gender diversity-firm performance relationship. (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This article investigates the impact of women directors on financial outcomes--return and risk of Indian companies. It applies fixed and random effects Tobit regressions to examine the effect of female directors on financial outcomes (returns and risk) of the firm, controlling promoters' shareholding, leverage, firm growth and age, board size and board meetings. The study does not find any support to agency and resource dependence theories because the proportion of women directors in most Indian boards is too small to make much impact. However, it has a moderating influence to reduce variations in accounting profits and stock returns. The investors reward also meeting the regulatory quota of woman member on the boards by higher market returns indicating a signalling effect. The study adds an understanding of quota induced women directors' influence on the firm's financial outcomes. However, the regulators should be cautious in mandating induction of women members on the boards as they might be inexperienced or lack the needed grounding to effectively influence board processes.

This article studies the impact of the Board of Directors (BOD) on financial reporting quality (FRQ) in Vietnam listed companies. The research uses FEM, REM and GLS regression models, data collected at energy enterprises listed on the stock market in Vietnam from 2010-2018, with 2162 observations. The research results have found that the BOD size, BOD independence, BOD chairperson cum CEO has a positive impact on FRQ while BOD meeting frequency has a negative impact on FRQ. In addition, the audit quality, the ratio of liabilities has a positive impact on FRQ while company size has a negative impact on FRQ. Further, the percentage of female BOD members does not have an impact on FRQ. Empirical research results serve as a useful basis for enterprises to improve FRQ by considering of factors of the board of director in a more effective manner. (c) 2020, Sciedu Press.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore why different directors feel different levels of accountability toward board tasks. Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs a reflexive three wave data and analysis process culminating in a rich data set of 49 interviews with Australian directors and 15 h of boardroom observations. Findings: Differences in role identification lead directors to perceive their accountability differently resulting in wide variation in levels of firm specific knowledge, eventually affecting their breadth of contribution to board tasks. Research limitations/implications: Researchers should question the application of traditional governance theory (such as agency theory) if it fails to account for individual differences in intrinsic self-interest. Practical implications: Selecting board members for their functional knowledge alone may not always produce optimal outcomes for the board and firm. Board induction processes and ongoing director training are important tools to inform and remind directors of their role and accountabilities on a board. Originality/value: This paper establishes that the strength of directors' identification with either the director role or expert role affects what they feel accountable for, the development of firm specific knowledge and long-term efficacy as a director.

The paper examines the impact of corporate governance (CG) on firm value (FV) of enterprises in Vietnam. We consider the GC issue from the individual aspects of each member of the Board of Directors (BOD). The research uses GLS regression model, data collected at energy enterprises listed on the stock market in Vietnam during the period 2008-2018, with 2937 observations. The research results have found that the size of the BOD has a direct impact on FV, while it is interesting that the Board of Directors' independence has a direct impact on FV when measured by market value, but is in an inverse relation with FV if measured at book value. In addition, BOD chairperson cum CEO has an inverse impact on FV and female BOD members do not have an impact on FV. Further, the research results also prove that an enterprise's size is directly related with its value, whereas financial leverage is inversely related with the enterprise's value. Empirical research results serve as a useful basis for enterprises to increase their value, thus enabling the consideration of factors of the board of director at each enterprise.

Nonprofit boards of directors are responsible for the governance of their organizations. Despite a wide literature on board governance, empirical studies have focused primarily on board characteristics such as board size, frequency of board meetings, or board member characteristics. Building on prior literature, we use qualitative interview and survey data from nonprofit board members and executive directors, respectively, to develop a board coaching framework to better understand how board dynamics, in particular staff support for board activities, can influence overall board performance. Our findings suggest the need to recognize the central role executives and staff play in nonprofit governance. (c) 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The number of women in the boards of directors has increased in a lot of international firms, in recent years, with the help of the gender quotas, but we do not know whether this fact leads to an increase in gender equality. Based on a literature review about gender diversity, business performance, and perceived gender equality, the present research investigates if perceived gender equality is present in the Italian listed companies, which are subjected to mandatory gender quotas, analyzing if differences between men and women exist. Given the fact that almost all Italian listed companies have reached the minimum threshold imposed by the law (20%), we analyze whether and which differences exist in perceived gender equality, between men and women, using a questionnaire based on previous studies in literature review. This paper contributes to expand the empirical studies and literature review emphasizing the relevance of identifying the presence of gender equality in the Italian listed companies to a better understanding of the perceptions within the boards of directors and to the differences between the two genders.

Establishing a corporate governance strategy that promotes the efficient use of organisational resources is instrumental in the economic growth of a country, as well as the successful management of firms. This book reviews existing literature and identifies board structural features as key variables of an effective corporate governance system, establishing a multi-theoretical model that links Board structural characteristics with firm performance. It then, using a comprehensive empirical study of 265 companies listed on the Karachi Stock exchange, tests this conceptual model. This research serves as a significant milestone, reflecting the socio-economic setting of emerging economies, and highlighting the need for the corporate sector in emerging markets to move away from a 'tick-box' culture. It argues that the sector needs to implement corporate governance as a tool to mitigate business risks; appoint and empower non-executive directors to achieve an effective monitoring of management; and establish their own ethical and governance principles, applicable to the Board of Directors. Based on an extensive data base, collected painstakingly over five years, this book offers new insights and conceptual framework for further research in this area. Given the breadth and width of the research, it is a useful source of future reference for students, researchers and policy makers.

This book takes the central issues facing board members today and applies the giving voice to values framework while also providing insights from practicing board members who have faced these issues. It covers such topics as strategic planning and monitoring, director independence, privacy and cyber risk, executive compensation and CEO succession planning. With this book, readers will also grapple with the conflicts of interest that might arise in the director selection process, role of the nominating committee and the compensation committee in order to cultivate more optimal board dynamics. The principles of giving voice to values start by asking a deceptively simple question: 'What if you were going to act on your values-what would you say and do?' The book then provides an overview of the current landscape of corporate governance along with the major rules and director duties applicable to the board of directors. The book's latter chapters contain a series of five scenarios common to the board of directors that are presented as a set of "Board Challenges" involving the tensions often found in board work. In Giving Voice to Values in the Boardroom, the author, Cynthia E. Clark, provides practical strategies for board members and other constituents of corporate governance to deal with these challenges. These cases are designed to help users of the book implement prescripting and action planning. Each case will also have discussion questions about the stakes and stakeholders, common reasons and rationalizations and examples of how firms and governance professionals have handled similar board challenges.

The composition of the boards of directors is a key aspect for the development of companies. The increase of the women presence in the labor market is not translated as a significant increase in the gender diversity of the boards. In this work, the determinants of gender diversity in the boards of Spanish listed companies in the period 2001-2018 have been analyzed. Economic, financial and corporate governance factors have been considered. ROE is found as a determining and positive factor of gender diversity on the Spanish boards. The results show that the implementation of a gender diversity policy by the company, as well as a corporate social responsibility committee positively affect the percentage of women in the boards of directors of the listed firms. Industries show diverse and, sometimes, opposite effects among the factors considered. Our results can help regulators to propose policies and incentives to achieve larger gender diversity in the boards and management positions. (c) 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This paper examines the impact of banks' corporate governance mechanisms in terms of ownership structure, board size and composition on the loan quality in the Tunisian banking sector. To do so we use panel data method and a sample that contains the ten largest banks in Tunisia over the period 2001-2012. Our main findings show that ownership concentration worsens loan quality in the Tunisian banking sector. However, the presence of independent members in the board of directors improves loan quality through better monitoring actions. Our findings also suggest that Tunisian banks with CEO duality manage better their loans. Copyright (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Boards of directors affect corporate strategy and decision-making through monitoring of management and resource provision. Recently, an increasing number of studies have examined the relationships between board characteristics and corporate social responsibility (CSR). These studies have yielded inconsistent findings. This article therefore reports the results of a study applying meta-analytical techniques to a sample of 82 empirical studies to help clarify the relationships between board characteristics and CSR. Although prior research has tended to apply relatively simplistic models investigating the impact of individual board characteristics independently and only directly, we adopt a more complex perspective to shed new light on the board characteristics-CSR nexus. Specifically, we use a meta-analytic path model that accounts for the potential interplay between board characteristics in determining CSR and tests whether the presence of a CSR committee plays a meditating role. Our findings suggest that board size, board independence, and female board representation are partially interrelated with each other and jointly influence CSR directly as well as indirectly via the presence of a CSR committee. In addition, we find that country-level institutional factors act as moderators and that the relationships differ with regard to the specific dimension of CSR (i.e., social, environmental, or aggregate).

The role of business sector in addressing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is increasingly recognised around the world. The SDG 5 Gender Equality has given impetus to actions in many countries in the form of gender equality and gender diversity in businesses. Rapid progress has been made recently in achieving gender representation on corporate boards with voluntary initiatives such as the 30% Club in Australia and other countries. This study differs from previous studies in that it considers the ethical and social dimensions rather an economic angle by examining the association between gender diversity and corporate social responsibility (CSR). The limited prior research with this approach has focused on the US and UK context with emphasis on analysing how female directors with their unique views, perspectives and specific experiences contribute to strategic decision making and for addressing issues that are of concern to society and stakeholders. Continuing in this vein, this study examines the association between gender diversity and positive and negative dimensions of CSR separately. For a sample of constituents of the ASX 300 Index and employing systems Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) methods, this study finds evidence supporting both the token theory and the critical mass theory. Both positive and negative dimensions of CSR are unrelated to gender diversity when there is a token female representation on the boards of directors. However, companies that have improved gender balance undertake more positive CSR activities and reduce negative or controversial activities that hinder CSR. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Investigating a sample of firms from the S&P 500 Index (between 2004 and 2015), the paper addresses the relationship between the representation of Women on Corporate Boards (WOCB) and the Corporate Social Performance (CSP). It adopts the instrumental variable quantile regression panel data (IV-QRPD) model, suggested by Powell (2016), to solve endogeneity and heterogeneity issues. The article shows a strong "threshold effect": the impact of board feminization on CSP is nonlinear and changes along the quantiles of the performance distribution. Highlighting a contextual and multilevel phenomenon, the paper contributes to the CG literature offering main achievements on board's dynamics and inclusiveness. (c) 2020

Boards of directors have recently become more attentive to their stakeholders' concerns, providing more transparent information and adopting more sustainable business strategies. This study investigates the influence of a critical mass of women on boards on the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure score and its three components separately. Using a sample of the FTSE-MIB listed companies in the 2005-2017 period, we show that reaching a critical mass of female board members--going from one or two women to at least three--enhances the level of ESG disclosure. The results also show that the critical mass of female board members has a positive influence on every component of the ESG score, with the highest contribution of women reaching the governance score. These findings provide insights to shareholders and policymakers and suggest that a critical mass of female board members is particularly effective in improving transparency, and it can be seen as a mechanism to transit to stakeholder governance, fostering more sustainable behavior in firms.

Research Question/Issue: We examine the impact of two differing types of employee board representation (i.e., labor board representation and employee shareholder board representations) on environmental, social, and corporate governance components of ESG performance and the moderating role of each type of employee board representation on the relationship between ESG performance and the firm's market value. Research Findings/Insights: Using a propensity score matching approach on a sample of French firms listed in the SBF 120 index from 2007 to 2017, our findings reveal that labor board representatives act in the opposite direction to employee shareholder board representatives by focusing exclusively on improving social performance and reducing environmental and corporate governance performance. The way employees are represented on the board of directors also moderates the corporate ESG-financial performance relationship differently. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Employee directors are not a homogenous group. The differentiation between the two types of employee directors (i.e., labor board representatives and employee shareholder board representatives) brings a deeper understanding of the effect of stakeholders' representation on the board. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results are of interest to governance policymakers because they provide them with a fresh understanding of the key role of employee board representation. A meaningful inference to be drawn from our findings is that employee ownership and the representation of employees on the board as employee shareholders may bring about fundamental changes in employees' attitudes and behavior on the board and may, in this regard, be considered as a credible way of generating social harmony and constructive relationships between employees and shareholders.

Previous research about the effects of board structure and process on the firm financial performance is based on conflicting theoretical perspectives, and empirical results, mostly based on regression analysis, are inconclusive. Building from Complexity Theory and configurational analysis, this study offers clarity to inconclusive previous empirical results about the link among several board features and firm financial performance. From a sample of 295 non-financial firms from Southern Europe for the period 2001-2010, and by using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, findings of this study show that firm financial performance depends on a complex configuration of several board features (board size, board independence, leadership structure and board activity) and several corporate characteristics (firm size, firm leverage and firm age). This paper has implications for academics. Despite different theoretical arguments and inconclusive results of the wide empirical literature addressing the effect of board characteristics on the firm performance, building from Complexity Theory this paper adds to our knowledge because it empirically explores under which circumstances different board features should contribute positively or negatively to firm performance. The results of this study have also implications for policy makers and practitioners by providing some useful hints to the controversial relationship between corporate governance and financial performance. In this sense, general corporate governance recommendations must be rethought. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Prior research suggests that corporate boards and directors play important roles in firm strategy and performance. In this paper, we examine an important yet under-explored avenue and focus on their role in overcoming the multilevel psychic distance (PD) faced by internationalizing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) originating from an emerging market. Analysing Indian Fintech SMEs, using multiple case studies, our findings reveal that boards contribute important network-level resources and knowledge about foreign markets, which in turn assists internationalizing SMEs in mitigating PD. We demonstrate that the human and social capital of boards play important, yet distinctly different, roles in mitigating PD at pre- and post-internationalization phases. At the pre-internationalization phase, directors' prior international and industry experience, as well as board interlocks and prior connections, are most valuable, whereas at the post-entry phase, transnational boards, and those with stronger trust-based personal relationships (i.e. greater depth of social capital, facilitate faster experiential learning. Taken together, our findings contribute novel insights into the mechanisms through which boards affect the outcomes of firms operating, and originating from, extreme institutional environments. Further, we draw implications for research and practice. (c) 2021 The Authors. British Journal of Management published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Academy of Management

The purpose of this research is to synthesise and critically evaluate the extant literature investigating the role of board of directors as a core element of corporate governance in corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance. Adopting a systematic review approach, a sample of 67 studies from 18 highly regarded scholarly journals published between 1992 and 2020 is examined. Distinguishing between two board attributes of director characteristics and board structures, our study uncovers similarities and inconsistencies regarding the effects of various board characteristics and board structures on CSR performance. First, our study reveals that these attributes do not work in isolation but interact with each other and the context in which they are embedded in shaping CSR performance. Additionally, our review identifies substantial variation in conceptualisations, theoretical frameworks, the use of measurements and the contexts across studies providing a basis to offer a comprehensive synthesis of dominant scholarly discourses and an organising lens for future scholarship.

Academic research is generally seen as one of the most important goals of a university, but universities are being called upon simultaneously to assist in building a local entrepreneurial ecosystem and contributing to economic growth. Universities can be the source of startups based on academic research results and thereby influence a given industrial context. This paper investigates the impact of academic entrepreneurship on the economic performance of university spin-offs (USOs) and, in particular, how the composition of the founding team, the diversity of academic ownership, CEO duality, and the presence of women on the board of directors affect USO success. We study these relationships with a cross-sectional sample of 136 firms in southern Italy. Our findings highlight that governance and ownership can influence various indicators that are often used for measuring enterprise success in different ways and that, based on the specific success metrics, managers or policymakers should consider different aspects to better understand a USO's potential for success.

The literature on gender diversity in boards of directors has expanded significantly in recent years, due to the fact that women are increasingly holding higher management positions within the company hierarchy, clearly demonstrating that certain characteristics of women have a positive impact on different areas within the company. The objective of this paper is to analyze scientific articles on the presence of women in boards of directors, based on a literature review, in order to learn about the evolution of this concept over time. The search conducted for this paper produced 300 documents from the Web of Science, with a final total result of 168 documents after passing the initial results through various filters. VOSviewer software was used to analyze the information, which enabled the creation of bibliometric citation, co-citation and co-word maps. The results reveal the most relevant authors and studies on this subject and identify the most current studies, the main topic of which deals with sustainability and corporate social responsibility, in addition to highlighting the characteristics of women that are of vital importance to boards of directors within the current context: empathy, open innovation, concern for the needs of interest groups and a heightened perception of risks.

Does the appointment of more women and ethnic minority directors on corporate boards help combat discriminatory work environments? This empirical study addresses this question by exploring the occurrence of large-scale discrimination lawsuits. Drawing from social identity theory and empathy-based perspectives, we propose that a greater presence of female and minority directors on boards reduces the likelihood of large-scale discrimination lawsuits given their propensity to advocate for underrepresented groups in the workplace. Our analysis of data from 452 US firms from 2010-2015 indicates that a higher proportion of female and minority directors on boards is associated with a lower likelihood of such lawsuits. Specifically, the likelihood of such lawsuits is lower where there are three or more (a critical mass) female and minority directors. "Token" appointments (one or two female or minority directors) do not reduce the occurrence of these lawsuits. Further, the joint presence of minority and female directors on boards significantly reduces the likelihood of such lawsuits. Finally, we found that female CEOs help in reducing the occurrence of such lawsuits when the board has two or more female directors. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of greater gender and ethnic diversity on boards in combating workplace discrimination. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

Purpose: This study aims to elucidate the relationship between women's participation on the board of directors and the company's financial performance in a sample of 45 Colombian companies listed on the Colombia Stock Exchange (CSE) (Bolsa de Valores de Colombia). Design/methodology/approach: Using 50,214 financial records of 45 companies listed on the CSE during 2008-2016, the authors performed panel data regressions to explore the relationship between the measures of gender diversity on boards and the impact on corporate financial performance. Findings: The authors show that the participation and presence of at least one woman on the board of directors are positively associated with firm financial performance as measured by return on equity (ROE), but not as measured by Tobin's Q. This second indicator is positively associated with firm financial performance when there are at least three female directors on boards of 10 or more individuals. Practical implications: The findings also provide evidence supporting the development of managerial and organizational mechanisms that strengthen female presence at the highest level of governance. Originality/value: The study demonstrates that female presence on boards has a positive impact on firms' financial performance, but the degree of diversity impacts differently ROE and Tobin's Q. These findings are based on a study of an emerging economy in Latin America, and data on similar economies are scarce. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: It has been over 20 years since the landmark publication of Mizruchi (1996) and his examination of "what do interlocks do?". Since then, the nature of interlocks and subsequent research on the subject has evolved. This paper aims to revisit the literature on interlocking directorates through a quantitative bibliometric analysis. Design/methodology/approach: This study undertakes a bibliometric analysis of literature citing the Mizruchi (1996) to examine the state of research following up on "what do interlocks do". This study examines 718 publications using keyword and co-word analysis, along with a thematic analysis to revisit the research that has followed Mizruchi's topic of what do interlocks do. Findings: This study finds that the topics of the corporate elite, capitalist economy and corporate governance have remained prominent themes in the field. Research areas that are emerging in the field of interlocking directorates include gender diversity, globalisation and advancing theoretical frameworks. Originality/value: This paper provides a quantitative bibliometric analysis to revisit the extant literature on "what do interlocks do", examining a high number of articles to identify areas which could be developed to advance research in the field.

The current U.S. climate of racial and social injustice has prompted a renewed call for diverse and equitable ways to rethink community philanthropy. Community foundations are vehicles for community philanthropy which offer vast benefits for social improvement and community development. The board of directors ensures these organizations fulfill their mission, making decisions on funding priorities and holding the organization functionally and fiscally responsible. Drawing on constructs of diversity and representative bureaucracy and a case study of Florida community foundations, we suggest that diversity is understood in different ways and the presence of diverse board members may be linked to advancing the interests of diverse communities and in achieving outcomes that assist in the needs of certain social groups. Increased understanding of diversity can improve foundation and philanthropic effectiveness and bring broader social change by promoting equity and social justice among community-based philanthropic organizations.

Using resource dependence theory, we analyze board interlocks, their industry origin, and their relationship to firms' greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Interlocks create connections by having board members from one firm sit on other firms' boards, providing an avenue for sharing information and resources to aid in knowledge transfer and capability development. As firms face challenges for improved GHG emissions performance, they may look to their board members' connections to other firms to acquire needed resources. Using a sample of US Standard & Poor's (S&P) 1500 firms for years 2009 to 2018, we find that firms with a greater number of board interlocks achieve lower GHG emissions intensity. We also find that boards for the best performing companies have interlocks in the same industry, in other industries, and with firms leading in GHG emissions intensity, especially for firms in higher environmentally impacting industries, as they face greater emissions challenges.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the relationship between a diverse set of corporate governance (CG) mechanisms and corporate sustainability disclosure (CSD) in Southeast Asian countries under national stakeholder reform. Design/methodology/approach: Data analysis is based on 171 of the largest companies across six Southeast Asian countries using a 30-item CSD measure. Findings: The authors find that there are wide variations in the levels of CSD across the countries. The findings indicate that board size, board gender diversity, block ownership and the presence of a sustainability committee are significant determinants of CSD. Additionally, whilst more stringent stakeholder governance reform motivates firms to publish more sustainability information, it fails to influence the effectiveness of the board of directors in promoting CSD. Practical implications: Findings of this study highlight the essential role internal governance structure plays in monitoring corporate actions and enabling corporations to reduce their legitimacy gap. The findings further encourage regulators and policymakers to question, with utmost importance, the effectiveness of stakeholder reform in making significant organisational changes. Originality/value: There is a dearth of studies that examine the CG-CSD nexus in relation to specific institutional characteristics. Existing studies mainly focus on a single country with similar institutional environments and thus limiting the ability to understand the "context specificity" of sustainability content development. This paper provides an overview of stakeholder reform in Southeast Asian countries and empirically substantiates the relationship between CG and CSD across six countries undergoing such reforms in the region.

This study contributes simultaneously to research on women board members and competitive dynamics by investigating two unresolved research questions: What is the effect of female directors on the firm's competitive repertoire? Under what conditions is this effect more pronounced? Leveraging the "Awareness-Motivation-Capability" (AMC) framework, we predict that having women on the board of directors should impact the complexity, heterogeneity, and volume of the firm's competitive moves. Relying upon a sample of U.S. pharmaceutical firms for the years 2000 to 2017, we find that adding female directors on the board positively affects the complexity and volume of a firm's competitive moves, but negatively impacts the heterogeneity of competitive actions. In addition, the presence of a female CEO moderates these effects, leading to more complex competitive actions and increased volume. Thus, our study lends a greater understanding of how female board members influence competitive dynamics and shape the strategic direction of the firm. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

This paper examines the impact of the gender and ethnic composition of corporate boards (board of directors and audit committee) on stock liquidity in the context of South Africa. More specifically, we focus on the interaction effects of gender diversity and ethnic diversity on stock liquidity. Using a sample of listed South African firms for the period 2009-2013, we find that firms with more female or black directors on corporate boards are associated with a higher level of stock liquidity. However, the interaction effect indicates that the positive impact of ethnic diversity on stock liquidity is attenuated with the greater presence of gender diversity. These findings are explained through board effectiveness and corporate information flows. (c) 2020 Accounting and Finance Association of Australia and New Zealand

This paper examines the effect of Board of Directors' (BD') roles and composition on exploratory, exploitative and ambidextrous innovations. A quantitative research was operated on Tunisian listed companies. Semistructured interviews were also realised with directors of these firms to discuss the findings. Results of the multiple regression analysis conducted indicate that BD' service role positively influences exploratory, exploitative and ambidextrous innovations. These types of innovation are negatively linked to BD' control role and not significantly associated with BD' strategy role, board independence and gender diversity. This paper sheds light on an innovative and unexplored topic in the literature, as prior studies focused on the effect of BD on innovation rather than on innovation types or even on ambidextrous innovation. This study provides interesting insights for firms that seek to improve their corporate governance. It highlights the BD' key attributes that firms must focus on to innovate.

Purpose: The objective of this paper is to investigate the emergence of corporate political activities (CPAs) in the form of social responsibility in the banking sector in Bangladesh. The use of institutional logics allows the authors to explore not only the motivations underlying this sudden shift in corporate approach towards corporate social reporting (CSR) disclosure but also to investigate whether a logical plurality exists in this new approach. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is based on 21 in-depth interviews with policymakers, regulatory bodies and top management and members of boards of directors in the banking sector. Findings: The findings of this study are both consistent with and different to those of Uddin et al. (2018). While their findings show that Bangladeshi companies engage in CSR activities primarily to demonstrate their allegiance with the ruling political regime driven by notions of traditionalism, this study's findings show the existence of a logical pluralism across industries in the manner they engage with CSR activities and disclosures. In addition to the dominant market logic, the authors also find the co-existence of community and family logics shaping the nature of CSR disclosures made by banking companies in Bangladesh. Originality/value: The authors contribute to the accounting and management literature by providing first-hand evidence of the motivations underlying the emergence of CPAs in the context of a developing country. The adoption of an alternative theoretical framework allows the authors to identify the multiple logics that dictate corporate attitude towards CSR engagement and disclosure.

In 2013, India became the first country in the world to require firms to spend two percent of their average profit on corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. Taking advantage of this unique event, we examine how the mandatory CSR compliance impacts conditional accounting conservatism of Indian firms. We find a positive relation between CSR compliance and conditional accounting conservatism and this relation is stronger for firms that have stronger governance and weaker for family firms. Further, we find that current period accounting conservatism is negatively related to next period CSR spending. Our results are robust to a battery of tests and are consistent with the notion that Indian firms enhance accounting conservatism to decrease earnings to minimize CSR compliance costs. In other words, while policy makers may have intended to use legislation to increase CSR activities by Indian firms, our results suggest that firms use accounting policies and negative accruals strategically to mitigate CSR spending.

Research Question/Issue: Despite the importance of political ties to firm strategy and performance, little is known about why and how firms form political ties. This study examines how firm-specific governance structures function as important determinants of the formation of political ties and how the impact of governance structures evolves during institutional transition of emerging economies. Research Findings/Insights: Our empirical analysis is based on a longitudinal data set involving manually coded political ties of listed firms in Taiwan between 1996 and 2005. We find that business group affiliation and family ownership facilitate the formation of political ties but that such effects diminish as market infrastructures and regulatory institutions develop. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study systematically examines how corporate governance structures affect the formation of political ties. It identifies an overlooked explanation for the dynamics of political ties that resides in the internal governance structures of firms. It contributes to the corporate governance research by demonstrating how governance structures other than the board of directors can provide resources to facilitate strategic actions such as political tie establishment. It also enriches research on corporate governance bundles by showing the interdependence among multilevel governance mechanisms in the context of political tie formation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights for business executives interested in managing interdependence with government. While business group affiliates and family firms are better able to link to politicians, such advantages diminish during institutional transition. Hence, group leaders and family owners should consider other political activities to effectively manage political risks as institutions develop. (c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

We examine the relation between borrowing firms' corporate political transparency and the cost of debt. Using a sample of S&P 500 firms over the 2012-2016 period, we document a significant negative association between firms' corporate political transparency and their cost of debt. We also find that the negative association is more pronounced when the borrowing firms are in less unionized industries and have younger executives (CEOs or board of directors). Our results are robust to a variety of sensitivity tests. (c) 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

This study empirically investigates the role of political connections in corporate environmental spending. It employs a sample of listed Chinese firms from polluting industries within the 2010-2013 period. Our empirical results show that having politicians as directors reduces the magnitude of discharge fees. We also find that such reductions are more pronounced in firms with a higher ratio of politically connected directors (i.e., listed Chinese polluting firms that are privately controlled). This negative relationship is robust to various model specifications (e.g., a sample of polluting firms after addressing the sample selection bias and reverse causality without an increase in new investment). Moreover, we observe that the negative relationship between political connections and discharge fees is stronger in listed Chinese polluting firms located in more polluted regions. Meanwhile, a polluting firm's incentive to engage in environmental protection, measured by firm-level environmental awards (incidents), alleviates (exacerbates) the negative relationship. Finally, the impact of politically connected directors on discharge levies is explicitly driven by having local officials and officials from the home province as directors.

Purpose: This study aims to construct two environmental disclosure indices (EDI), one obtained from the mandatory reporting (annual report) and the other from the voluntary reporting (sustainability report), to compare their evolution. In addition, the authors developed and evaluated a conceptual model that aims to analyse if the two EDI are affected by industry, environmental certification, lucratively and corporate governance attributes. The legitimacy, signalling and voluntary disclosure theories are used to support the theoretical relationship between the company's characteristics, corporate governance and environmental disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: Using the content analysis technique, the authors have developed two indices to assess the level of environmental disclosure in the companies' mandatory and voluntary reporting. In addition, to analyse the determinants of EDI, the authors applied the technique of multiple linear regression using panel data. Findings: Based on Portuguese listed companies (Euronext-Lisbon), the results, from 2015 to 2017, exhibited an increase of 14.6% and 25.8% for the EDI obtained from the annual reports and for EDI obtained from the sustainability reporting, respectively. In addition, the results revealed that the environmental certification, lucratively, number of members on board and number and proportion of women of the board directors tend to affect the annual reporting EDI. Regarding the sustainability reporting EDI, the results showed that the environmental certification, lucratively and proportion of independent members of the board of directors have an impact on it. Research limitations/implications: The study focuses on quantitative rather than qualitative disclosures and it brings some insights to the theoretical field. Practical implications: The results obtained can assist corporate decision-making processes regarding the improvement of environmental disclosure, both on the mandatory annual report and on voluntary sustainability reports. Originality/value: This study brings new perspectives to this topical issue in accounting. Originally, this study is applied to Portuguese listed companies and it shows different trends and determinants of environmental disclosure when included in the annual reporting or sustainability reporting.

Research question: This study investigates how boards of directors perceive their roles in Scottish football clubs. With previous studies focusing on amateur and non-profit sport organisations (primarily in Canada, Australia and New Zealand), this research answers the call for more research into board roles and in other sport contexts. Research methods: A qualitative design is adopted and 24 directors of Scottish football clubs are interviewed. Football club directors are a difficult to access population and this research represents a rare opportunity to understand the perspectives of key sport governance informants. Template analysis is employed. Results and findings: Findings show that perceived board roles fall into five categories: control, service, operations, resource co-optation and strategy. Organisational size was found to influence perceptions of board roles in Scottish clubs, while an apparent alignment of interests between owners and managers, and a subsequent reduction in agency cost, has implications for the control role. An integration of stewardship theory and resource-dependency theory is argued to provide a more holistic understanding of board roles in this context. Implications: The study responds to calls for a multi-theoretical approach to board roles research by developing an integrative stewardship-resource dependency theory. The integrated theory is argued to be useful in framing the complex dynamics of board roles in Scottish football. Future research is encouraged to assess whether the stewardship-resource dependency theory can provide an effective framework for understanding board roles in other sport settings.

Building on the argument that corporate boards are responsible for the creation and leveraging of a firm's intellectual capital (IC), this study empirically examines the relation between boardroom characteristics--namely board size, director independence, leadership structure and gender diversity--and IC efficiency. Additionally, we propose that the family firm (FF) status is a specific condition that moderates the effect of board features on IC efficiency. We test the above propositions using data on 113 nonfinancial firms continuously listed on the Italian stock exchange over the period 2011-2016. The empirical results indicate that (1) IC efficiency is significantly lower in FFs, which challenges previous research claiming that FFs have some performance advantages over non-FFs and (2) that board size and director independence have an opposite effect in FFs and non-FFs (positive and negative, respectively), suggesting that the role of individual board mechanisms as drivers of (or brakes on) IC efficiency is contingent on firm characteristics. This paper extends the empirical literature supporting the link between board composition and IC efficiency, which has been scant and inconclusive. Furthermore, the literature has seldom considered the firm contingencies potentially affecting this relation. Regarding practical implications, our findings indicate that there is no one best way of structuring corporate boards that can fit all firm conditions; specifically, the results call into question conventional 'best practices' of board composition that emphasise director independence, suggesting that this governance mechanism may not have a consistent effect on organisational outcomes such as IC efficiency.

Financial corruption has an extensive adverse impact on corporate stakeholders. Over the last two decades, numerous prescriptions have been offered to improve the governance of US public firms, yet financial corruption is still prevalent. Board of directors' audit committees are typically charged with the responsibility of assuring that the corporation's financial reports satisfy the criterion of accuracy. We propose that a quad-qualified audit committee director can serve as an exemplar corporate overseer of financial reporting and minimize the likelihood of corruption. We predict that by having the qualifications of independence, directorship experience and financial expertise, bandwidth, and stock ownership, the effectiveness of monitoring financial reporting by such a director will be considerably enhanced, thus complementing the benefits of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) enacted in 2002. To test our predictions, we employed a time-lagged, matched-pairs sample of 328 large US corporations (164 financially corrupt firms plus a comparison group of 164 compliant firms). Controlling for covariates, we found that the presence of a quad-qualified audit committee director reduced the likelihood of financial corruption in a public firm by 72%. Combined with the benefits from SOX, having at least one quad-qualified audit committee director decreased the probability of financial corruption by 92%. Our results also show that having just one quad-qualified audit committee director is more effective than the combination of the individual qualifications dispersed among the committee members.

This study explores diversity reporting by New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) listed companies, arguing that diversity goes beyond gender and includes differences in age, ethnicity, sexuality, religious beliefs and physical disability. We argue that gender diversity and deep diversity elements (race, age, sexual orientation, disabilities, ethnicity) have a synergistic relationship and that gender diversity objectives cannot be achieved without attaining diversity objectives in these other elements and vice versa. Designing a 30-item diversity disclosures index, this study undertakes a content analysis of the diversity-related disclosures made by 152 NZX listed companies. Analysing diversity-related disclosures in annual and sustainability reports, we find that the NZX listed companies predominantly relate diversity only to board gender diversity. Deep diversity elements at all organisational levels, however, do not receive much attention, with a few exceptions. Our results highlight that female representation on organisational boards has a positive impact on overall organisational gender and other diversity aspects and vice versa. The results of an emphasis on the totality of diversity have important implications for boards of directors, corporate managers and regulators interested in improving the corporate governance and diversity practices in New Zealand organisations.

Purpose: This study aims to explore corporate governance (CG) practices that can lead to firms' better performance in different organizational life cycles. The authors propose a configurational approach to explore how a set of CG practices combine in bundles to achieve high performance outcomes for firms across their corporate life cycles. Design/methodology/approach: Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis was used to analyze a sample of data of 21 countries and 9 industries. Data referred to the period of 9 years extending from the year 2005 to the year 2013. Findings: This study reveals that there are multiple CG practices that exist through firms that can achieve high firm performance. Moreover, CG practices combine in different ways for firms in their growth, maturity and declining stages. Research limitations/implications: This study demonstrates the value of using a configurational analytical approach to explore both the firm and country-specific CG practices (together) that engage firms to achieve the desired level of performance across the corporate life cycles. Practical implications: The current study draws attention to the policymakers' need to assess the current level of regulatory and competitive development of their countries and form policy accordingly. The approach used in the current research study not only offers the linkages between CG and performance to managers as incentives to comply with regulation but also to view CG-related activity as a strategic move. Social implications: The approach used in the current research study not only offers the linkages between CG and performance to managers as incentives to comply with regulation but also to view CG-related activity as a strategic move. Originality/value: This study broadening the focus of CG studies to include a rigorous explanation of the global CG phenomena and to provide effective solutions for the practitioners. Contribution to Impact: This study demonstrates the value of using a configurational analytical approach to explore both the firm and country-specific CG practices (together) that engage firms to achieve the desired level of performance across the corporate life cycles.

Research Summary: Boards are unlikely to be effective if they do not have sufficient collective expertise to understand, monitor, and address future risks. This begs the question, does the board, in fact, have this expertise? If not, can they reconfigure their expertise to address those risks? Building on agency theory, we analyze the alignment between the board's expertise and the firm's future risks, with the expectation that board composition will change over time to reflect the firm's future risks--strategic reconfiguration. Our results show that misalignment has negative implications for firm performance, misalignment also motivates appropriate board reconfiguration, and that this reconfiguration positively effects firm performance. Managerial Summary: Our study illustrates the need for board expertise to be aligned with firm risks. While there has been increasing pressure for firms to assess their directors' expertise (i.e., skill matrices), simply identifying expertise which is present or absent does not speak to whether that expertise is actually needed (or not) by the firm given the risks faced. We analyze boards' collective expertise, compare that with the risks that firms are facing, and identify the gaps which may detrimentally impact the monitoring ability of the board and cause firm performance to suffer. Consequently, understanding the degree of (mis)alignment is of paramount importance for boards to be effective monitors and positively influence firm performance. (c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

BACKGROUND: This paper examines the effects of a board's diversity on firm financial performance using a sample of 76 companies listed on FTSE100 over the period 2010-2015. This period reflects the years following the financial crisis of 2008 when mounting criticism emerged that weak corporate governance partly explained The Financial Crisis. It is suggested that the Board of Directors' composition may have played a pivotal role in the Crisis and that Boards that better reflect society perform better. OBJECTIVE: This research examines the impact of gender, age, nationality, and presence of independent directors on firm performance. METHODS: Data on board characteristics were collected from Hemscott, as well as information from the companies' annual reports and financial database FAME. Using the Generalized Method of Moments, the data were assessed to examine board diversity and firm financial performance. RESULTS: This study consists of 456 observations from 76 listed FTSE 100 companies during the period 2010-2015. Twenty-four companies were excluded due to missing data that related to directors' attributes after controlling for firm characteristics, board structure, and potential endogeneity issues, the findings support the business case for gender and nationality board diversity. However, no significant associations were found between firm financial performance and board age diversity or board independence. CONCLUSION: This study, although British based, joins a growing global body of evidence that more diverse boards improve firm performance. It is incumbent on practitioners, decision-makers, and politicians to educate and persuade firms' directors of the merits of more diverse boards. (c) 2021 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

The continuous escalation in cybersecurity risk and the frequency of operational IT failures have drawn attention to the importance of the board of directors' monitoring function and responsibility for maximizing IT value-protection. In response, boards have sought to enhance their IT competence levels. We assert that, while higher board IT competence has positive implications in IT value-creation, it could have a negative implication in the IT value-protection context. When firms have a more IT competent board, equity investors' ex-ante expectations of superior oversight of IT by the board are baked into those firms' equity prices. When such firms experience operational IT failures, investors would view their boards as relatively ineffective in IT oversight and adjust more sharply the ex-ante expectations built into equity prices. Using agency-theoretic arguments, we develop this reasoning into a hypothesis that board IT competence is negatively associated with firm market performance post operational IT failures. Our analysis of 107 operational IT failures in public U.S. firms provides support for this hypothesis, even after we address the potential endogeneity of board IT competence. (c) 2021

Corporate governance sits at the intersection of many disciplines, among them law, business, management, finance, and accounting. The point of departure for large portions of this literature concerns the ugliness of greed, ambition, misdemeanors, and malfeasance of corporations, their directors, and those actors who hold shares in them. This essay takes a rather different starting point. Drawing upon insights from a distant field, it uses the discussion of aesthetics in Dewey's treatise on art to ask what motivates directors to act in ways that constitute the attention and engagement that we associate with the effectiveness of boards. Using Dewey's thinking about aesthetic experience, this paper examines the experience of organization boards, both in the literature and in the personal experience of the author. These observations point to need to reflect on motivation when considering both the practice of corporate governance and the policy frameworks in which it operates. (c) 2020, The Author(s).

Scholars endorsing the embeddedness outlook call for directors' greater engagement in the strategic management process. In contrast, scholars endorsing the control outlook argue that directors should focus on fulfilling their fiduciary duty of supervising top executives. Based on the behavioral-agency theory, this paper outlines a conduct outlook on boards. Recognizing the benefits of directors' participation in the strategic management process, we hypothesize that it may boost directors' satisfaction with firm's performance, strategic planning, and strategy. This could lead to cognitive entrenchment and spur inertial tendencies. Structural equations modeling analysis of the data from a survey of 367 Canadian directors supports the hypotheses. These findings add knowledge to latest research on the advantages vs. disadvantages of activist boards. (c) 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

The chapter analyzes female involvement in medium-sized family businesses in Central Italy. The empirical analysis focuses on 233 firms over the period 2007-2014, to understand how female representation in corporate governance has evolved in recent years, and to pinpoint the factors tending to encourage/discourage female involvement in the board of directors. A descriptive analysis was conducted, enabling a fuller understanding of how female involvement in governance roles has evolved over the years. A regression analysis was performed to determine if and how specific governance characteristics - such as family ownership and generational stage - may have a bearing on the female presence on the board. The results confirm that female representation is favorably influenced by a strong family presence in the ownership of the business, while family firms under first-generation control exert a negative influence on female involvement.

We investigate the relationship between gender diversity on corporate boards and environmental performances of firms. Our central focus is the extent to which a country's economic status (developed, developing) can shape such a relationship. We find evidence that gender diversity is positively correlated to environmental performances of firms. Interestingly, this correlation is not only stronger in developing countries but also increasing in gender diversity. These findings have considerable importance in terms of policy. Promotion of gender diversity in developing countries, where abatement costs are the lowest, would improve global environmental quality in a costeffective way. This is best achieved through building institutions and strengthening them. The benefits of such policy go beyond developing countries frontiers, particularly when global environmental problems (pollution, global warming, ozone layer depletion, loss of biodiversity, etc.) are concerned. These benefits can be a leverage for an efficient implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) both as gender diversity stands as a goal by itself and also because it facilitates achieving other environmental-related SDGs.

This study aims at identifying the determinants of gender diversity and nationality diversity in the boards of Vietnamese listed firms. The data are hand-collected from 257 companies listed on the Ho Chi Minh stock exchange (HOSE) and 214 companies listed on the Ha Noi stock exchange (HNX) in the period 2015-2017. The main analyzing methods include Pooled OLS, REM, FEM, and GMM. The research results show that gender diversity is determined by three factors, industry, family firm, and board size. Concerning the determinants of nationality diversity of the board, there is evidence that firm size, foreign ownership, state ownership, and proportion of foreign sales predict the nationality diversity. Based on these results, some administrative implications are proposed to improve the structure of the board, including expanding business scale, promoting exports, limiting the increase in the number of members on the board of directors, reducing state ownership, and increasing foreign ownership.

The board of directors' diversity plays a crucial role in the firm's decision-making process, which includes risk management. This study proposes a multidimensional index to measure board diversity. We use the Standard and Poor's (S&P) 1500 between 1996 and 2013 to analyse the relationship between board diversity and credit risk. We find an inverse and significative relation between board diversity and credit risk, which means that diversity matters in credit risk, and more diversity leads to less credit risk.

Attracting the interest of investors and gaining capital during the initial public offering (IPO) is the most important task that a company faces while going public. Management board diversity is the tool that company use to signal their value. The aim of this study is to analyse the relation between the management board composition and the amount of capital gained by Polish non-financial companies going public on the Warsaw Stock Exchange over the period of 2006-2018. The results of multivariate regression analysis show that larger board size and higher level of board diversity in terms of age are statistically significant and are positively associated with the amount of capital raised in IPO by companies. Still, board gender diversity is not an important factor explaining IPO proceeds. Our study reveals that control variables such as company size and listing delay, but not profitability, are correlated with the dependent variable. Copyright (c) 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose: Several empirical attempts have investigated boardroom processes and their impact on the governing team decision-making. Such attempts, however, have derived in inchoate results opening new methodological debates and leaving the underlying patterns of board processes obscure. This paper aims to shed light on these patterns by empirically examining the interrelation among the three central constructs involved in board decision-making: know-how, demographic diversity and directors' social interactions. Design/methodology/approach: A framework of interrelation among know-how, demographic diversity and social interactions was conceptually built and empirically validated with partial least squares structural equation modelling applied to archival data from a sample of 87 boards of directors of Spanish, German and UK listed companies. Findings: Results unmask the intricacies of behavioural processes involved in know-how-demography relation: demographic diversity contribution to know-how is totally and positively mediated by directors' social interactions. This reveals the power of directors' socialization frequency in determining processes and predicting know-how. Practical implications: The paper offers a new pathway to manage board know-how and to make board diversity effective. It also opens a door to an innovative empirical methodology to make board processes emerge, one that overcomes methodological limitations of previous efforts. Originality/value: This is so far the only study that examines and measures holistically the structural interrelation among the three central constructs determining board decisions and performance: know-how, diversity and social interactions.

Integrating theoretical perspectives on tokenism and perceived preferential selection, we explore whether the relationship between chief executive officers' (CEOs') external board memberships and CEO compensation is gendered. Based on recent pressures to diversify corporate boards, we theorize that female CEOs' memberships on external boards will result in less monetary compensation relative to male CEOs due to concerns of organizational decision-makers that female CEOs generally inhabit token or "symbolic" positions of limited value. Additionally, we present competing hypotheses (i.e., mitigation vs. exacerbation) regarding how this devaluation will be affected by female representation on the board of directors and compensation committee, respectively. Using a panel sample of 12,464 firm-year observations comprising of 1,805 unique firms and 2,782 unique CEOs, the relationship between CEO external board memberships and compensation is indeed weaker for female compared to male CEOs. Furthermore, this devaluation primarily occurred in organizations where there was stronger (vs. weaker) female representation on the board of directors or compensation committee. However, supplemental analyses revealed that this differential devaluation was mitigated when female executives on the board held greater power (i.e., chaired important committees), highlighting the importance of moving beyond mere representation to ensuring influence on boards for female directors.

This study investigates how firm structure, chief executive officer (CEO) power, and federal legislation influence hiring of corporate directors from a diverse background. Combining the value-in-diversity hypothesis and the similarity-attraction paradigm, we examine the impact of economically rational (i.e., business need) and social preference (i.e., similar-to-me bias) drivers of board diversity post-the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). Using a sample of S&P 1500 firms from an eight-year period spanning SOX, we find that SOX is positively correlated with board diversity. Although SOX was not intended to increase board diversity, the changes it put in place have subsequently facilitated more board diversity. Results show that the economically rational predictor (firm operational complexity) had a positive and statistically significant effect on board diversity pre-SOX but that effect disappeared post-SOX. Meanwhile, CEO power, a social preference inhibitor of board diversity, had a negative and statistically significant relationship with board diversity pre-SOX which also disappeared post-SOX. It appears that SOX has mitigated both economically rational drivers to want more diversity as well as social preference drivers to want less diversity. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed. (c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

The goal of corporate spin-offs, as a corporate restructuring technique, is to create better value for both the divesting firm and its subsidiary/division. These corporate transactions lead to the creation of independent, publicly traded entities, which are called spun-off subsidiaries. In this study, we examine the effect of board independence and directors' industry experience on the market performance of spun-off subsidiaries by setting two main hypotheses. Our sample includes 123 completed U.S.-based spin-off events during a 14-year long time frame. According to our empirical analysis, we find support for both hypotheses, which appear to be significant and positive. In addition, our moderation analysis shows that the interaction effect of directors' industry experience and board ownership is positive and significant. Based on the arguments of agency and resource dependence theories, this study contributes to the governance literature by proving the significant importance of board of directors (namely, their independence and industry experience) on the market performance of spun-off subsidiaries after being separated from their corporate parents. From the managerial contributions aspect, this study tells us that if the board is independent and includes directors with the same industry experience, these spun-off subsidiaries will experience positive change in their market performance. Our interaction effect also shows that if board members are offered more shares on the top of their industry experience, the change in market performance will be stronger.

Women director appointments on boards of public listed and/or licensed companies in Malta registered on the Malta Stock Exchange plc only account for 10.7% of all appointees. This is considerably less than the EU average of 33% for board members in STOXX Europe 600 Companies. This paper's main research objective is to assess the current situation in the appointment of women on these boards. Based on the similarity-attraction theory and resource dependency theory, the author investigated the process by which women are appointed on boards and elicited underlying reasons for this gender shortfall. Furthermore, current views on the adoption of gender quotas will be explored. The research methodology was based on a qualitative approach. Two research tools were adopted; the first, an online questionnaire submitted to women directors and the second, in-depth structured interviews conducted with chairpersons, the Maltese regulator, and Women Directors Malta. Thematic findings emerged indicating actual practices adopted by companies in considering women board appointments and shed light on the challenges in promoting gender diversity. The initial and informal process of appointing directors on these Boards was examined. The nomination committee plays a crucial role in identifying potential candidates. The current mode of board selection limits the pool of qualified women candidates. Boards need to cast a wider net in search of relevant skills sets. Women face significant career barriers and challenges to be appointed on Boards. It is claimed that women candidates do not always enjoy a 'high visibility' profile, and some argue that they seem to be under the radar. They may not be networking sufficiently in spheres of influence where the dynamics of boardroom politics pan out. Potential women candidates need to engage with networks that include influential powerbrokers. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of gender quotas as a corrective mechanism intended to address the under-representation of women on boards.

The supervisory role the board of directors is an essential corporate governance control mechanism, particularly in countries where external mechanisms are not well developed. The composition of the board based on gender can affect the quality of this supervisory role and thus the financial performance of the firm. While some national capital market regulators, such as UK, Germany and Australia, have introduced recommendations and disclosure requirements, other countries, such as Norway, Spain and France, have by legislation a minimum requirement of women's participation in a company's board of directors. While the matter of board gender diversity has captured researchers' attention in recent years, most empirical results use US data. The present paper attempts to contribute to the growing literature of non-US studies investigating the link between gender diversity in the board and firm financial performance by focusing on the UK. We use panel data analysis and find that gender diversity--as measured by the percentage of women on the board and according to two indices--has a positive effect on firm value. That means that it is the balance between women and men that UK companies should focus on instead of merely the presence of women since the latter alone does not have any impact on firm performance. Our study also suggests that investors in the UK do not penalize firms which increase their female board membership and that greater gender diversity can generate economic gains.

This study examines whether socially responsible firms carry higher research and development (R&D) intensity and how corporate governance quality influences this investment. Based on a sample of French firms belonging to the SBF 120 index from 2012 to 2016, the results show that firms with higher corporate social and environmental responsibility (CSER) score have greater R&D intensity. These companies try to protect environment and to create positive social impact by the use of new technologies. Moreover, the findings confirm that firms with better corporate governance quality invest more on R&D. Finally, the results reveal that some control variables influence significantly R&D intensity. The findings in this research may be of practical interest to investors, sustainable professionals and modern consumers who are aware of social and environmental concerns and who are trying to keep themselves informed about strategies used by businesses to improve CSER practices.

This article investigates how the board diversity affects firms' carbon emissions reduction and whether environmental innovation moderates this relationship. In addition, the moderating effect of environmental innovation in carbon-intensive versus non-carbon-intensive industries is also examined. Using data of the companies listed on the Standards & Poor's 500 index from 2002 to 2018, the 2SLS regression results indicate a statistically significant negative relationship between board gender diversity and carbon emissions. Environmental innovation amplifies the extent of this relationship. We find evidence that the moderation effect of environmental innovation is more pronounced for carbon-intensive firms than non-carbon-intensive firms. Our findings reinforce various corporate governance initiatives and public policy being undertaken all over the globe to encourage more gender diversity in the board of directors, demonstrating that board diversity enhances better board effectiveness in satisfying the needs of broader groups of stakeholders' interests. The findings could be beneficial for stakeholders and regulators concerned with improving corporate governance mechanisms as well as reducing the carbon footprint. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: Recent regulatory changes in Europe have promoted non-financial reporting practices (e.g., Directive, 2014/95/EU) and gender diversity in decision-making positions. Special attention is devoted to promoting the gender balance on corporate boards as a key mechanism to enhance corporate governance effectiveness and better address multiple stakeholders' needs. With this in mind, this study intends to examine the impact of boardroom gender diversity on Environmental Social Governance (ESG) disclosure practices in the European listed firms' context. Design/methodology/approach: The study applies different panel data models on an extended sample of 1,392 firms from 21 European Union (EU) countries for six years (2014-2019). Findings: Findings allow to spotlight the positive role exerted by the presence of women directors on the boards in enhancing ESG disclosure, both at the overall and specific (individual ESG scores) level. Research limitations/implications: Policymakers and regulators might consider the study's evidence as a stimulus to continue in promoting strategic actions and reforms that foster gender equality and balance in corporate decision-making positions. Practical implications: Creating a heterogeneous and diversified board of directors may support implementing a "sustainable corporate governance" recently claimed by the EC. Originality/value: The study contributes to the literature by disentangling the links between gender diversity and ESG disclosure over a period that covers a long season of European regulations and measures that affected both non-financial reporting practices and the board of directors' composition. Accordingly, it can contribute to enhancing the practical and theoretical understanding of the pivotal role that gender diversity may exert in strengthening corporate governance and, in turn, corporate transparency and accountability behaviours about non-financial issues.

We examine how gender diversity on boards of directors affects investment in research and development (R&D), thereby providing the platform for future ambidexterity of the organization. Using quantitative data from 44 countries, that are exemplified by qualitative data, our findings show that gender diverse boards result in more complex organizational outcomes in regard to R&D investment than assumed originally. Our findings show that gender diverse boards encourage ambidexterity. On the one hand, increased gender diversity has a negative direct effect on R&D. However by positively affecting equity based remuneration, these diversified boards actually encourage indirectly higher R&D investments that are better correlated with the organization goals. Gender diversity on boards, therefore, encourages organizational behavior that increases the chances for higher ambidexterity over time by encouraging exploitative behavior as well as explorative behavior.

Given the mixed evidence that having both women and men in the top management team (TMT) or in the board of directors (BOD) has a significant influence on organizational innovation, we resolve this issue by conceptualizing TMT-BOD gender diversity as part of a multiteam system, that has joint effects which impact organizational innovation. Evidence from the study of both Chinese firms and UK firms confirm our conceptualization by showing an interaction effect between TMT gender diversity and BOD gender diversity such that innovation is greatest when both are high. The positive TMT-BOD gender diversity interaction effect on innovation improves subsequent firm performance particularly in dynamic environments. The findings refine current thinking by going beyond research that tests intra-team TMT or BOD diversity independently and instead considers inter-team diversity across both leadership teams within the strategic leadership upper echelons. In sum, findings show that high levels of TMT and BOD gender diversity result in more organizational innovation, which ultimately improves firm performance. We offer implications for women's inclusion in leadership as well as for research on the upper echelons. (c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the impact of corporate governance attributes, in the form of board characteristics, on risk disclosures provided through integrated reporting (IR). Design/methodology/approach: Drawing upon an agency theory perspective, this study examines the effect of the main corporate governance board characteristics (size, gender diversity, independence and meeting frequency) on the level of risk disclosure provided by a sample of 95 IR adopters from 24 countries for 2018. Findings: The results suggest that firms are slow to realise IR's potential to produce innovations in risk disclosure mechanisms. In addition, certain board characteristics, such as gender diversity, independence of directors and meeting frequency, are positive drivers of the risk disclosure provided via IR. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on risk disclosure provided via IR. Connecting corporate governance mechanisms to IR risk disclosure practices can contribute to enhancing the practical and theoretical understanding of the role that the board of directors may play in stimulating transparency and accountability about risks via an alternative communication tool, IR, to the benefit of both investors and other stakeholders.

Of all actors involved in managing an organizational crisis, strategic leaders play a particularly central role. However, the growing scholarship on the impact of strategic leaders in crisis situations is characterized by a high degree of fragmentation, considerably hindering the generation of parsimonious theory and practically useful insights. To address this issue, we conduct a systematic multidisciplinary literature review that spans the research streams on strategic leadership and organizational crises. For each type of strategic leader--Chief Executive Officer (CEO), top management team, and board of directors--we identify the different applied theoretical lenses and highlight commonalities and differences between studies and their insights. We use our review to derive an integrative conceptual framework that guides future research. Our exploratory review unveils that, while each type of strategic leader plays a significant role in a crisis context, the perspectives taken and the resulting evidence vary: as for the CEO, research focuses on social evaluations--for instance, based on the CEO's appearance--as well as agency-theoretic considerations--particularly, financial incentives. Regarding the top management team, research mostly adopts a managerial and organizational cognition lens, focusing on characteristics such as personality and human capital. Lastly, for the board of directors, agency-theoretic considerations again dominate the scholarly conversation, especially studies of board independence. Overall, we review and organize a rich but patchy research landscape, and we derive ample opportunities for novel theoretical and empirical inquiries into strategic leaders and their role in managing organizational crises.

This exploratory qualitative inquiry examines the perspectives of 26 board members in medium-sized, privately held companies operating in the United Kingdom. The study question investigates how digital technologies (DT) are impacting on board director capabilities. Different board members' experiences from their own perspectives are examined, with attention on capturing the influence of digital technologies on the way that board directors work. Thematic analysis offers a rigorous approach to analysis and enables articulating deeper and meaningful understandings of individual director experiences. Findings presented as a framework, indicate that DT impacts all board directors' capabilities as four major aspects: gathering, interpreting and sharing information; board stewardship; blue-sky strategizing; and scoping predictive strategic priorities. Theoretical contribution is to Resource Dependence Theory (RDT) as an outcome-focused lens, which best explains a firm's interest in digital technological advantage through board contribution and outcomes. In conclusion, practical insights for board members and regulators are highlighted. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This paper is an empirical study of the effect of the characteristics of the Sharia supervisory board (SSB) on the financial performance of Islamic banks. Design/methodology/approach: Using 42 Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Islamic banks outside the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and non-Islamic countries during the 2011/2018 period, a random-effects generalized lease square method for the regression analyzes is applied. Findings: The obtained results show that the characteristics of the SSB affect the financial performance of Islamic banks. The results also affirm that a large-sized board of directors and the number of SSB meetings improve banking performance while the cross-mandate seems to destroy it. On the other hand, the SSB members' competence and reputation and the proportion of women sitting in SSB have no impact on the financial performance of Islamic banks. Research limitations/implications: This paper gives a comprehensive literature survey on the effect of the characteristics of the SSB on the financial performance of Islamic banks. Practical implications: This study offers insights into the practitioner and Islamic banking regulators interested in enhancing the legitimacy of corporate governance in Islamic financial institutions. Originality/value: This paper is among the few studies that investigate the effect of the characteristics of SSB on the financial performance of Islamic banks in particular in Islamic banks in the MENA region outside the GCC and in non-Islamic countries.

CEOs, boards of directors, and owners are believed to be important actors in affecting environmental innovation. Yet, there is a lack of combined view on the three actors in the literature. This study aims to explore the sources of environmental innovation from the perspective of corporate governance bundles. Considering the interdependent nature of the three, this study proposes a configurational model consisting of CEO (formal and informal) power, board capital (breadth and depth), and ownership (institutional and insider). We undertake a qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) on a sample of 250 dirty firms and discover six sufficient configurations for high environmental innovation. These configurations suggest that there are multiple paths for achieving high environmental innovation. Furthermore, both powerful and weak CEOs can be environmental innovation facilitators if they are accompanied by suitable board archetypes and ownership structure. (c) 2022 The Authors

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relation between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and firm financial performance, and how audit quality moderates this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses panel dataset of 200 French firms listed during 2007-2018 period. The direct and moderating effects were tested by using multiple regression technique. Findings: The authors find that CSR has a positive impact on firm financial performance proxy with return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and Tobin's Q (TQ), suggesting that investment in social activities helps firms to achieve better financial results. The authors also find that the improvement effect of CSR on corporate financial performance is more pronounced for firms audited by Big 4 auditors. Research limitations/implications: One limit of this study is the selection of independent variables. We are limited to one variable, namely CSR engagement. Further studies may consider other independent variables, such as the age of the company, the type of industry, the composition of the board of directors, etc., in order to provide an in-depth analysis of corporate financial performance drivers. Practical implications: The findings have practical implications that may be useful to managers in their management of the firm. They encourage all board members to seriously weigh investing in developing strategies that promote the social behavior components in order to improve overall corporate performance. Originality/value: The research adds to the current literature on CSR by revealing the impact of external auditor quality on the CSR-financial performance relationship. In addition, it investigates not only the overall CSR ratings but also each of CSR dimensions, namely environmental, social and governance. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines whether the board of directors' compensation schemes affect stock market valuations for banks in a dual banking system (Islamic and conventional banks). We employ an international sample of 11 countries for the period 2010-2015. Our results show that for the full sample (i.e. irrespective of the bank type), board of directors' compensation has a significant and positive impact on stock market valuations. For different bank types, we find that the positive effect of the board of directors' compensation on market valuations holds only for conventional banks, with insignificant evidence for their Islamic counterparts. We, also, examine the impact of Shari'ah supervisory board's compensation on Islamic banks value. Our results show that investors positively perceived and priced information related to this boards' compensation. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the indirect relationship between board gender diversity and capital structure decisions and to examine whether the capital structure is affected by the type of approach used to promote women's participation in the boardroom. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of French non-financial listed companies over the period 2006-2019, this paper uses structural equations modeling, difference-in-differences using propensity score matching and chow test to highlight these effects. Findings: This paper finds that the relationship between the board gender diversity and the capital structure is mediated through the information transparency channel and firm risk taking channel. Furthermore, the results show that the effect of board gender diversity on capital structure decisions varies through the approach adopted (voluntary, enabling or coercive). Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature in several ways. First, the study is to the knowledge the first to examine whether and how board gender diversity affects capital structure decisions through two mediations channels, namely, the information transparency and the firm risk taking. Second, the study is one of the first to examine whether the capital structure is affected by the type of approach used to promote women's participation in the boardroom: coercive, enabling or voluntary approach.

We examine the relationship between board of director committees tasked with risk management and environmental performance, based on a sample of 1466 firm-year observations from 2007 to 2015. We find that the presence of board committees dedicated only to risk management is associated with better environmental performance. The human capital of risk committees (measured by board tenure, committee tenure, experience, and qualifications) is also positively related to environmental performance. Our findings suggest that the benefits of risk management committees extend to non-financial matters, such as environmental performance. Our findings further suggest that environmental performance is now managed through the regular governance mechanisms within firms. This supports the notion that environmental performance is managed for economic reasons and for the benefit of investors, rather than for the aggrandisement of individual managers. Our findings should be of interest to boards, CEOs, and CFOs who are interested in risk management, as well as to investors, lenders, and auditors who are interested in assessing risk.

This study extends research on the board nationality and gender diversity to a new, unchartered, methodological territory of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). QCA is based on Boolean algebra and facilitates the application of set-theoretic reasoning to the data analysis. This work adds to the repository of academic studies, which put forward a 'business case' for the board nationality and gender diversity in terms of their positive impact on the board outcomes. Based on the upper echelons theory and the 'value-in-diversity' proposition, we assess the influence of board nationality and gender diversity on board commitment, which is measured with two proxies: the annual number of board meetings and board evaluation. The findings indicate that both board nationality and gender diversity are part of the intermediate solutions for the outcome variable. The impact of both variables on board commitment is typically detected in large firms that are internationalised but not product-diversified, the boards of which tend to be small. These results confirm that the increasing emphasis on ensuring significant board nationality/ethnic and gender diversity in board composition within the regulatory documents on corporate governance represents a step in the right direction.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the direct and indirect relationship between board gender diversity and corporate tax avoidance using corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a mediating variable. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a panel dataset of 200 French firms listed during 2007-2018 period. The direct and indirect effects between board gender diversity (BGD) and tax avoidance were tested by using structural equation model analysis. Findings: The results indicate that the presence of women on corporate boardrooms negatively affects tax avoidance. The greater the proportion of women in boards, the lower the likelihood of tax avoidance practice. In the mediation test, CSR appears to partially mediate the link between women on boards and corporate tax avoidance. Additional analysis shows that the social dimension of CSR produces this mediating effect. Practical implications: The results have practical implications for companies in regulating the composition of their boards. To benefit from diversity, firms have to increase women's percentage in their boards of directors. Also, investors are encouraged to pay attention to the percentage of female directors when investing and purchasing shares. Social implications: This study proved empirically that the higher proportion of female directors significantly reduces the possibility of tax avoidance either directly or indirectly through enhancing CSR performance. The findings show that firms with gender diversified boards are more likely to get involved in CSR for hedging against the potential consequences of aggressive tax avoidance practices. In light of the above results, firms are well-advised to strongly apply the policy encouraging or mandating women as board members to take advantage of their expected benefits. Originality/value: The originality of this paper consists in proposing the establishment of both direct and indirect relationships between BGD and corporate tax avoidance through CSR. Unlike prior studies that have been examining the direct relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and corporate tax avoidance, this study went further to investigate the indirect relationship between these two constructs. This study also differs from prior studies as it examines the effect of BGD on each of constituting pillars of CSR, namely, environmental, social and governance. To date, an extensive part of CSR research has used the combined score of CSR, but the effects on different CSR pillars remain little investigated. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Cyber risk has become one of the greatest threats to firms in recent years. Accordingly, boards of directors must be continually vigilant about this danger. They have a duty to ensure that the companies adopt appropriate cybersecurity measures to manage the risk of cyber fraud. Boards should also ensure that the firm disclose material cyber risk and breaches. We examine how the board's gender composition can influence the extent of such disclosure, based on a sample of the companies listed on the S&P/TSX 60 Index over the period 2014-2018. Results show evidence of a positive association between the presence and level of cybersecurity disclosure and board gender diversity. However, the board must boast a critical mass of at least three women before this positive impact can be observed. Our findings contribute to the debate on the importance of gender diversity by adding the concept of the positive influence of heterogeneity on cyber disclosure. We also augment the literature on the critical mass of women in boardrooms by providing empirical evidence that three or more women constitute the threshold for better governance. Our study has important implications for investors, stakeholders and regulators. If investors wish to increase cybersecurity disclosure, they should ask for more diversified boards. Our findings support regulators in their efforts to increase women's representation on boards by providing empirical evidence of better outcomes with this type of board composition.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to shed light an important limit of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) in pursuit of its substantial purpose, which is to achieve sustainability and contribute to achieving the objectives of United Nation (UN) Agenda 2030; the paper also suggests how to overcome those limits. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a survey of board members of listed and un-listed Italian companies. Data were analysed using an ordered probit model. Findings: The results show that a greater involvement of a board member in the non-financial reporting process is associated with a stronger commitment towards sustainable development. Specifically, the involvement in materiality assessment is positively associated with more proactive behaviours towards sustainability. Research limitations/implications: The use of self-reported assessments on beliefs and behaviours and the application of an online survey are methodology limitations of the study. Regarding theory, the study contributes to the literature on corporate governance and sustainability, integrating upper echelons theory, which focuses on how individual attributes influence a firm's strategies and governance, with research on how leadership practices can have a positive impact on corporate sustainability goals. Practical implications: The paper underscores the opportunity for policymakers to increase the effectiveness of the NFRD through deeper involvement of the board members in the process of non-financial reporting. The results could also be of interest to governance bodies in terms of defining a board's tasks and practices to encourage the adoption of behaviours oriented towards a stronger engagement in sustainable issues. Originality/value: This is the first study to provide evidence of the relationship between individual directors' tasks and behaviours, non-financial reporting and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study highlights some of the limits of the NFRD, even after the public consultation to revise it, and suggests how to overcome these limits. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We examine the effect of dual board governance mechanisms (Shariah supervisory board and regular board of directors) on Islamic banks' liquidity creation. We also investigate whether managerial ability is a channel through which such governance mechanisms influence liquidity creation. Using data for 110 Islamic and conventional banks from 11 countries for the period of 2005-2015, we find that better Shariah supervisory board (SSB) governance increases on-balance sheet liquidity creation but decreases off-balance sheet liquidity creation. This result is robust to an analysis of subsamples, to individual governance attributes, to interactions of dual governance mechanisms, and when controlling for endogeneity issues. Our results reveal that both SSBs and regular boards of directors affect liquidity creation by enhancing managerial ability. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

This paper provides a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of existing international accounting and finance research on the structure, characteristics, and diversity of corporate boards (SCDBs), as well as their effects on the corresponding corporate outcomes. Emphasis is particularly placed on synthesising and expanding current knowledge from both theoretical (i.e., economic and governance, regulatory, resource-oriented, and psychological/sociological) and empirical (i.e., multi-level antecedents of SCDBs and various themes of SCDB-related corporate outcomes) perspectives. Adopting the SLR method, we review 511 articles from 69 journals between the years 1973 and 2020. Our main findings are as follows. First, the majority of the papers in our SLR are descriptive in nature and/or use a single traditional theory (e.g., agency theory), rather than adopting an integrated multi-theoretical approach. Second, studies on the determinants or antecedents of SCDBs are scarce and have tended to focus on firm- and board-level issues rather than on institutional- and individual-level issues. Third, given the absence of cross-country, mixed-methods, and qualitative investigations, current articles in our SLR suffer from methodological constraints, such as inconsistent definition and measurement, insufficient variables, and repetitive quantitative research methods. Finally, opportunities and a future research agenda are explored and outlined. (c) 2022 The Authors

We examine the minutes of Indian banks' board meetings and offer insights into the issues tabled and discussed in bank boards. We find that risk issues account for only 10% of the issues tabled with regulation and compliance accounting for the most (41%), followed by business strategy (31%). Majority of the issues are not deliberated in detail. We interpret the evidence as suggestive of under-investment in risk and over-investment in regulation and compliance by bank boards. (c) 2022

Corporate governance has received substantial scholarly attention for decades, although the focus of this research has by and large been on publicly traded for-profit organizations. However, agency problems are increasingly recognized in nonprofits. As such, we examine the application of corporate governance logic in the context of nonprofits. Our study relies on nearly a decade of data spanning 6853 US-based charities and comprising nearly US$346 billion in total revenue. Our results show that common corporate governance practices--such as independent boards, chief executive officer oversight, and transparency--enhance the degree to which donor contributions are allocated toward a charity's mission. Overall, we assess the broader applicability and benefits of corporate governance and build on literature highlighting links between for-profit and nonprofit organizations. In doing so, we demonstrate the usefulness of governance in this economically and socially consequential context. (c) The Author(s) 2020.

This study contributes to the literature of women on boards of directors by showing how female board representation affects the board's involvement in the strategy of employment downsizing, and whether the downsizing strategy mediates female directors' influence on firm performance. We examine data of Taiwanese 1329 manufacturing firms over the 1996-2017 period and apply dynamic panel methods to deal with the endogeneity problems contained in the mediation model. Evidence on the gross effect of women on boards supports our contention that in Taiwanese socio-cultural context, the cognitive frames and human capital female directors bring to boards can improve the firms' accounting-based performance; however, investors' ingrained bias against women may dilute the positive impact and lead to unfavorable stock market reaction to the firms with female directors. Focusing on the indirect mediating effect, our results indicate that perhaps because female directors' leadership style and core values provide boards with more stakeholder-oriented perspectives, the firms with more women directors tend to implement less downsizing, and such talent-retaining strategy is beneficial to firm performance. This positive indirect effect is investors' bias-free, that is, women on boards can be leveraged for higher accounting returns and stock market valuation through their involvement in downsizing.

We examine the relationship between women directors and corporate social performance (CSP) by considering the contingency effects of home-country culture. Drawing on upper echelons and social role theories, we hypothesize that greater women representation on boards positively affects CSP due to their distinctive expertise, perspectives, and knowledge in this area, which strengthen their firms' attention and resources devoted to it. We then draw on the cultural perspective to explain how national culture moderates this relationship by shaping the salience of women directors' views and boards' openness to them. Based on data for 3175 firms across 38 countries between 2008 and 2015, our multilevel analysis provides support for most of our hypotheses. (c) 2022, Academy of International Business.

Drawing on the resource-based view, this study examines how board composition and board tasks affect the relationship between the firm's global focus and performance in private family firms. Based on a sample of 234 Belgian private family firms, our empirical analyses reveal that nonfamily involvement in the board attenuates the negative relationship between the firm's global focus and performance. Furthermore, our results show that the global focus-performance link turns positive at higher levels of board networking and advisory tasks, whereas board control task has no significant effect. Ultimately, these findings underscore the board of directors as a key governance contingency, highlighting its important role in overcoming the challenges of global expansion in private family firms.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential influence of internal and external corporate governance mechanisms on audit risk in Tunisian companies. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of Tunisian non-financial firms listed on the Tunisian Stock Exchange (TSE) over the periods 2005 to 2010 (pre- 2011 revolution) and 2011 to 2017 (post -2011 revolution), consisting of 371 observations for the whole period, the authors apply the generalized least square (GLS) to test the research hypotheses and model. Findings: The results are consistent with the agency theory suggesting that efficient corporate governance is able to control and reduce a company's agency problem. Evidence reveals that the effectiveness of the director's board/ownership structure and audit quality have the most influence on audit risk before than after the 2011 revolution, although governance mechanisms should play a more active role in encouraging companies to be more transparent in the post-revolution period. Moreover these findings are confirmed when identifying a composite measure of corporate governance. Practical implications: Significant implications are provided for analysts, investors, regulators and academics. First, findings can help Tunisian regulators determine corporate governance disclosure requirements. Second, this research will make investors and stakeholders aware of the fact that minimizing auditor risk will be effective in reducing agency problems in emerging markets like Tunisia. Then, this work can help researchers better understand and realize the corporate governance role in the quality of audit process and financial statements and encourage them to deeply and broadly investigate this issue on other emerging markets. Originality/value: This study stands for an extension of the existing research on corporate governance and audit risk. It fills a research gap in the local context. In fact, the considered data are those of the pre- and post-revolution Tunisian market, mainly in periods of instability. Although emerging markets make up the vast majority of economic activity around the world, they have received limited attention in academic research. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study investigates the board of directors' contribution to opportunity development in high-tech ventures. Based on the dynamic managerial capabilities perspective, we argue that more experienced boards will contribute more to opportunity development. Furthermore, building on the attention-based view, we argue that this effect will be moderated by structural and situational factors that affect board members' attention to the venture's opportunity development process. Using hand-collected data on 179 high-tech ventures in Belgium, we find that board experience has a stronger relationship with the board's contribution to opportunity development when board size decreases, when board tenure increases and when the venture underperforms. These findings offer a contribution to the literature on opportunity development in new ventures and to research on the boards of directors' role in new ventures. They also have important implications for entrepreneurs who are trying to develop opportunities and their stakeholders. Plain English summary While experienced board members have the potential to contribute to opportunity development in high-tech ventures, they often refrain from leveraging this experience due to the structure of the board and the situation of the venture. When high-tech ventures try to develop new opportunities, they mostly rely on the experience of the top management team. As this could limit the range of opportunities they see, bringing in experienced board members may seem a fruitful way of getting new information and a broader perspective. This study indeed shows that, in the context of high-tech ventures, more experienced boards can contribute more to opportunity development. However, even if board members have relevant experience, they are not always motivated to use this experience to the benefit of the venture. In fact, they are less likely to leverage their experience when boards are bigger in size, when board members have spent less time sitting together on the board, and when the venture performs better. The implication of this study is that high-tech ventures should be aware that board members can potentially contribute to opportunity development, but that their actual contribution depends on structural and situational factors that direct board members' attention to opportunity development.

Research on the outcomes of shareholder activism has gained momentum among management scholars in recent years. However, studies focusing on the way shareholder activists affect top managers' cognition are still in its infancy. Thus, this study examines the relationship between shareholder activism and chief executive officers' (CEOs') future focus on the basis of signaling theory. By applying a contingency view and considering various characteristics of proposals by activists as pivotal moderators, it intends to reveal the conditions under which activists stimulate CEOs' future focus. Empirical analyses not only confirm that shareholder activism shapes CEOs' future focus but also reveal that this effect is stronger when shareholder proposals are written in an analytical and powerful tone, contain more adverbs and verbs, and trigger CEOs' cognition by highlighting negativity. Conversely, more self-related proposals reduce activists' positive impact. Supplemental analyses indicate that the relationship between shareholder activism and CEOs' future focus may vary under the different characteristics of the boards of directors. Generally, the study provides an innovative and more 'humanized' perspective on the literature being among the first to examine the impact of shareholder activism on CEOs' future focus based on signaling theory. By exploring communication characteristics, the study also applies a relatively novel lens in management research. Moreover, it offers valuable practical implications for shareholders (proposals as effective means to increase interest alignment between shareholders and top-level executives), CEOs (proposals as an impetus to become more aware of future events), and boards of directors (proposals as an important governance tool).

Building on agency and resource dependence theories, we study the relationship between the value of initial public offerings and the extent of board independence, which we find to be an inverted U-shape: beyond a certain threshold, board independence becomes excessive. Consistent with agency theory, the inverted U-shaped relationship is more pronounced when ownership and control rights are separated. Consistent with resource dependence theory, the inverted U-shaped relationship is more pronounced in companies with higher industry diversification and less pronounced when the roles of the CEO and president of the board of directors are separated.

The boards of directors of state-owned enterprises and state institutions in South Korea is the subject of this research. These boards have not received significant attention in previous studies, despite their distinctive features and control role. The focus is on gender diversity with reference to task-related variables such as insider/outsider, tenure, and occupation. The extent of the board's monitoring was measured following the rates of revision and rejection of management plans in the board's minutes. The idea is to assess decision-making as a measure of the effectiveness of the boards. Based on longitudinal data on state-owned enterprises and state institutions in South Korea, gender diversity was positively associated with the extent of the board's monitoring. Understanding of the positive impact of gender diversity was enhanced with the inclusion of task-related diversity variables in the model. Tenure and occupation diversity were positively associated with the extent of the board's monitoring. It is proposed that the various diversity factors specific to organizational context be examined to improve understanding of diversity. (c) 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Purpose: This study investigates the relation between the board of directors' attributes and corporate social performance. The authors examine three board of directors: characteristics, size, independence and gender diversity, and how they interact with industry to affect corporate social performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a multivariate approach to analyze and compare the effects of governance variables on two aspects of corporate social performance, its environmental and social dimensions. Findings: Based on a sample of 983 firm-year observations, our main findings indicate that board independence, size and gender diversity each has a different impact on the environmental and social dimensions of performance, but that industrial sector moderates these effects. In particular, our results show that board member independence is positively associated with the environmental dimension of the performance of all the sample industries, but only has a positive association with the social dimension when the firms are in industries other than those that are environmentally sensitive. For these latter industries, board independence is negatively associated with the social dimension. Board size is positively associated with the environmental dimension for environmentally sensitive industries only and with the social dimension for all the industries examined, with a stronger positive effect on the latter in regard to environmentally sensitive industries. Research limitations/implications: Women directors appear to raise social and environmental concerns within the board, as evidenced by their positive effect on the firms' social and environmental performance, with a stronger impact on the former. Practical implications: Regulators can promote changes to the way Canadian companies select directors for the purpose of achieving sustainable performance while investors will be better informed about the impact of some of the board attributes on the environmental and social dimension of performance. Originality/value: This study provides a portrait of the impact of governance attributes on the environmental and social dimension of performance of Canadian companies. Given the increasing interest in gender diversity in recent years, this study provides new evidence on the benefits of female board members for the two non-financial dimensions of performance.

With the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in company activities, discussions on how to use AI in company management have emerged. Although AI is not legally recognised as a director in company law, there are examples of robot directors such as Vital, which have managed to get a seat in the corporate boardroom. Today, AI is on the verge of playing an important role in corporate governance. However, whether it has a seat on the board of directors or an important role in decision making is still a hot topic. Another critical discussion in the field of corporate governance in recent years is board diversity, which aims to improve the corporate decision-making process and create efficiency. This article attempts to anticipate the potential impact of AI on corporate board diversity policies and regulations. Therefore, this article seeks to examine the effects of the inevitable use of AI in the corporate decision-making process on corporate board gender diversity discussions and regulations under three possibilities: AI as a board member, AI as an enabler to assist a decision maker or AI being used to help decision making such as selecting board members.

Research that links boards in general and interlocks in particular with internationalization activities of emerging market multinationals (EMNEs) has recently garnered significant attention. However, a focused examination of the impact of the interlocks of different types of directors on the nature of EMNE internationalization strategy is missing. To address this gap, we use an integrated agency-resource dependence perspective to distinguish board interlocks provided by inside directors from those provided by independent directors to demonstrate their impact on exploratory and exploitative internationalization. We test our hypotheses on 1996 observations of Indian firms between 2011 and 2017. Our results show that while inside director interlocks promote exploitative strategies over exploratory internationalization strategies, independent director interlocks deter exploitative internationalization. Furthermore, these preferences are contingent upon the R&D intensity of the firm. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd

Firm leaders expect their chief marketing officers (CMOs) to have significant impact on firm performance, and boards of directors (boards) consider marketing-related issues critical board-level priorities. Despite the importance of marketers and marketing to firm outcomes, boards do not appear to value CMOs at the strategy-setting level of the firm as they rarely include CMOs in board discussions and deliberations. The disconnect between the importance of marketing and the marginalization of marketers at the board level prompts the following question: How and in what ways may boards impact CMO performance? This research includes two reviews of the extant literature (from 1984 through 2021): (1) board impact on CMOs, and (2) board impact on the satisfaction, performance, and outcomes of the broader top management team (TMT), including chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief operating officers, chief technology officers, and chief strategy officers. We find that only four articles investigate the impact of boards on any functional TMT member's performance and that none specifically consider how the board may impact CMO satisfaction, performance, and outcomes. Given the lack of research, we create a conceptual framework that links board characteristics to CMO outcomes and develop a research agenda with over 50 questions as the basis to develop scholarship. Importantly, this research highlights the paucity of insight regarding board-level influence on any functional TMT member, including the CMO. Consequently, the model and research agenda can benefit multiple disciplines including marketing, finance, information technology, operations, management, and human resources.

We investigate trends and determinants of board gender and age diversities using a sample of 8,590 firms for 20 years. Gender diversity and the average age of boards increased, while age diversity decreased in this period. We find that larger, older firms tend to have more gender diversity but less age diversity. More board independence is related to higher gender diversity, while more firm complexity is associated with less age diversity. For younger (older) boards, more female directors are associated with less (more) age diversity. We also find that female directors in older boards generate value for the firm. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

This research examines the impact of board gender diversity on CSR disclosure for Tunisian listed banks during the period 2012-2017. Data for CSR disclosure are collected using the content analysis of the annual reports of the banks. To measure the level of CSR disclosure, we used the grid adopted by Branco and Rodrigues (Corporate Communications: An International Journal 11:232-248, 2006, Journal of Business Ethics 83:685-701, 2008). The results show that board gender diversity affects positively the level of CSR disclosure. This implies that the female representation in the board of directors promotes CSR disclosure by listed Tunisian banks. Furthermore, the level of CSR disclosure is affected positively by the bank size and negatively by the directors independence. The paper contributes to the literature on best practices in corporate governance for financial institutions in emerging markets. The results have implications for banks and policy makers in Tunisia. For banks, it shows the relevance of female representation on boards of directors to meet the CSR reporting needs of the users of annual reports. Policy makers can enforce the presence of women in top management position and more specifically on the boards of directors when drafting corporate governance regulations.

This study provides an empirical investigation of the impact of Corporate Governance (CG) attributes on the environmental and social aspects of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The dependent variables considered for the description of the environmental and social aspects of CSR were determined using the Refinitiv approach, and through the lens of agency, stakeholder, and resource dependency theories. The independent variables were selected based on the literature and involve eight CG attributes, namely: CSR committee, CEO duality, board meeting attendance, board meetings frequency, non-executive board members, board gender diversity, board specific skills, and board experience. The employed methodology was evaluated through a sample of dependent and independent variable data of 313 companies across the European region excluding companies from the Eurozone for the period of 2006-2020. A suite of machine learning models was employed for capturing the most important determinants of the environmental and social aspects of CSR. The results reveal that three main corporate governance attributes may have a significant impact on a company's environmental and social performance. These attributes involve more female directors and directors with low board experience in board positions, and finally, the existence of CSR committees. The derived findings provide significant implications for corporate directors, socially responsible investors, policymakers, and regulators that intend to promote CSR initiatives and strategies.

There have recently been many calls to explore corporate governance in emerging economies, as these countries have distinctive characteristics such as a weaker institutional environment and the dominating influence of controlling shareholders. The literature has revealed that, in such institutional settings, there is the risk that powerful insiders maximize their own benefits at the expense of minorities and firm performance. This study advances our knowledge of corporate governance in emerging economies by exploring the moderating impact of quad-qualified directors - i.e., directors with independence, expertise, bandwidth, and motivation - on the relationship between dominant-owner CEOs and firm performance. We tested our hypotheses on a large cross-sectional sample of Indian listed firms. Our results show that dominant-owner CEOs undermine company performance, but quad-qualified directors may improve board monitoring and consequently attenuate their negative influence. Our findings support the soundness of the quad-qualified model for boards of directors, and contribute to the growing literature investigating which directors' attributes may have a significant impact on board monitoring and firm performance.

This study aims to identify the board of directors' characteristics affecting commercial banks' performance in Vietnam. The paper is based on the data collected over eleven years (2010-2020) for a set of 35 Vietnamese commercial banks listed on the stock market. The author explores the board of director characteristics affecting banks' performance in Vietnam on the platform of the quantitative regression method-System Generalised Method of Moments. The paper concludes that the statistically significant factors that involve the BOD<apos;>s characteristics affect banks' performance, namely board size, nationality diversity and board of directors' advanced education. The author also demonstrates the influence of ownership structures on those banks' performances. The results reveal that banks are owned and controlled by the government, and ownership concentration can improve and increase their performance. The author clarifies the role of the ownership concentration factor in the relationship to a bank<apos;>s performance. Significantly, commercial banks, which have their shareholders own over 5% of shares, namely institutions, the government, and members of the board of directors, can improve their performance because these shareholders have strict mechanisms to monitor and control the bank<apos;>s activities to minimize risks and increase the commercial bank<apos;>s performance.

In this article we investigate the effect of the presence of women on the board of directors and in executive positions on the risk and profitability of75 banks in ten ASEAN countries during the period of 2002-2018.We find that banks with more women in executive positions show higher capital risk, i.e., Z-score and capital ratio. However, the women-led banks have higher market to book ratios and they are more profitable in terms of return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). Furthermore, our findings shed light on the relationship between gender diversity and financial decision-making in the company by highlighting that the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) banks with more executives' women are more risky and have higher profits than the men-led banks. We also find that the proportion of women on the board standing as a director or a chair reduces performance in ROA and ROE. Bank performance measured by market-to-book (PB), is the lowest when there are females on the board. This highlights the gender differences in investment behavior and the women's needs in banks at Asian region. Given that bank performance has a direct effect on the stability of the financial system as well as on economic growth in the country, it is essential for the regulatory authorities to assess variety of sources which can improve performance and governance in (ASEAN) banks.

We study the dynamics of a major design choice in the governance of ventures: whether to distribute power at the top of the venture between a separate CEO and board chair. We propose that ventures are more likely to combine (separate) their CEO and chair positions when operational performance is poor (strong), demonstrating behavior in line with the threat rigidity thesis. Paradoxically, however, ventures would most benefit from a separate CEO and board chair when operational performance is poor. Empirical analysis of data from the Australian mining industry offers general support for our theory, with some interesting nuances. We discuss the implications of our findings for emerging conversations in the literatures on venture boards, boards of directors, and entrepreneurship. (c) 2022 The Authors

This paper explores the sociology of gender pay equality in leadership positions. Using a large compensation dataset, we examine the impact of gender pay inequality among directors and executives on firm performance. Based on a triangulation research design, quantitative outcomes are supplemented with semi-structured interviews to study compensation expectations, negotiation skills and gender differences in teamwork on boards of directors. The findings show that remuneration transparency is becoming the norm. However, compensation inequalities still exist and undermine performance. The results indicate that diversity targets or specific policies regarding equality and equity of opportunity are insufficient if they are not supported by a cultural understanding and the application of equitable policies and procedures throughout the organisation.

Purpose: Prior studies provide mixed evidence on the association of board busyness and firm productivity. Thus, this paper empirically analyzes how board busyness affects firm productivity. Design/methodology/approach: To measure board busyness, this paper computes the percentage of directors on a board who sit on three or more boards. Furthermore, to calculate firm productivity, the paper employs data envelopment analysis. Findings: Findings demonstrate that the association of board busyness and firm productivity (association) is generally negative and statistically significant but economically insignificant. In this respect, the findings reveal that the association is negative (positive) and both statistically and economically significant for firms having higher monitoring (advising) needs. Moreover, the findings demonstrate that regulatory oversight (1) weakens the general negative association; (2) changes the direction of association from negative to positive, for firms having higher monitoring needs; and (3) does not influence the association, for firms having higher advising needs. Originality/value: Taken together, the findings indicate that the association of board busyness and firm productivity is conditional to monitoring/advising needs and regulatory oversight. As such, the findings enrich the current debates on the association. Furthermore, the findings offer novel perspectives to enrich the regulatory frameworks of countries which are constraining multiple directorships. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Board director independence is critical to achieving and maintaining control to address the agency theory-based issue of interest misalignment between the principal (the organization) and the executives (agent). However, theoretical and empirical research and strategic risk considerations have brought into question the role or relevance that director independence plays in these control task and agency theory domains. We ask, using a quantitative survey method, whether board activity-based applications of independence may be associated with the service task of the board, namely its resource dependence mission. Our findings suggest that the resource dependence duty of the board may be positively associated with some autonomous activities, and yet other activities might be driven primarily by normative practices. Based on this, we suggest that a theoretical scope beyond and greater than agency theory may be needed when reassessing the role of director independence.

Purpose: This study aims to examine whether the age and tenure of the chair of the board of directors are related to research and development (R&D) investment in China. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses A-share manufacturing firms that traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange between 2009 and 2018. This study uses OLS regressions, controls for self-selection bias, and uses an instrumental variable to alleviate the concern of endogeneity. Findings: This study finds that chair tenure has a negative relationship with R&D investment. This study does not find a significant relationship between chair age and R&D investment. Originality/value: This study contributes to corporate governance and strategic management literature by highlighting chair tenure as a new factor affecting R&D investments. It also adds a significant contribution to the limited literature on the chair's role in strategic decisions. Moreover, companies that are eager to strengthen corporate governance and maintain sustained innovation may reconsider the chair tenure. Given that many proposals for board governance reform explicitly stress the importance of limiting board tenure, this study contributes to policymakers by providing evidence in support of these proposals.

Gender diversity on the board of directors can influence companies' voluntary disclosure such as their environmental, social and governance disclosure (ESG). A growing body of literature suggests that most of the work of the board occurs in committees, which are smaller working groups within the board. In a smaller working group, even a small number of women can represent a higher proportion of the group. Therefore, the influence of gender diversity on a board's decisions can be more prevalent in committees, since women's ideas and opinions can have more of an impact in smaller working groups. By being on committees, women have the chance to actively contribute to board tasks and decisions. This study investigates the relationship between the gender diversity of the board and its main committees and the ESG disclosure of Canadian-listed companies. The results indicate a positive and significant relationship between female representation on the board and committees and ESG disclosure. Using a structural equation model, the results suggest that there is a joint influence on ESG disclosure of gender diversity at the board level and at the committee. level. In addition, the study demonstrates that for ESG disclosure, the influence of female representation on committees is higher than the influence of female representation on the board. This study shows that by being on committees, women can better contribute to board decisions and that the influence of board gender diversity is not limited to female representation on the board but also comes from female representation on committees.

Many studies on the impact of boards of directors on corporate social responsibility have focused on the human capital of board members (i.e., structures and characteristics). However, the relational capital of board members (i.e., board interlock centrality) has yet to be fully explored. This study examines the extent to which board members are connected in their networks (i.e., board interlock centrality) on corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance in the restaurant industry. It also recognizes the moderating role of board effectiveness on the relationship between board centrality and CSR performance. On the basis of organization legitimacy theory and resource dependence theory, this study found that high-centrality boards increase positive CSR performance. The effect is more substantial when a firm has more standing board committees. The theories view firms as components of the larger social environment, and their performance depends on their ability to procure crucial resources from other firms through mutual exchange. No significant link was found between negative CSR performance and the moderating effect of board committees. (c) The Author(s) 2022.

The research subject focuses on gender diversity on boards and its impact on managerial performance and governance efficiency. Women presence on board can shed the light on cognitive and informational skills that can be beneficial for boards and the company itself. The literature review has elaborated determinants that deal with the research statement. A qualitative approach has been adopted. A semi-guided interview technique was adopted in order to seize seven women directors' perceptions. The data was treated was Nvivo software. The findings interpretation and discussion led for the establishment of five research propositions that centres on women contribution on managerial performance and governance efficiency.

This study examines the relationship between board political influence and corporate social responsibility (CSR) in Jordan. To achieve this objective, an index from 36-items was created by the researchers to measure the CSR activities of these companies. Using a panel dataset of 210 firm-year observations of industrial firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange over a four-year period (2014-2018), the findings showed significantly improved positive CSR activities by boards with greater political influence, also that implementation of CSR activities was strongly enhanced by external block holder presence on the board, whereas insider ownership showed mixed results and CEO ownership appeared negative; however, director ownership was highly positive and significant under both CSR measures. Furthermore, board independence had a negative impact on corporate CSR. The findings of the present study expand our understanding of the relationship between political influence and CSR activities, using various theories to explain particular theoretical associations.

Women's representation on corporate boards has recently drawn increasing attention. This study aims to investigate the moderator role of females on the board of directors on the relationship between earnings quality (EQ) and stock price informativeness. This research uses secondary data obtained from the Sahra database with the span of 158 active firms on the Tehran Stock Exchange from 2017 to 2021. Findings indicated that the presence of female directors on the board had a favorable impact on the correlation between EQ and pricing informativeness. That is, firms with more female board members have a greater association between EQ and stock price informativeness. The practical application of this research relates to female CEOs' monitoring roles, thereby enhancing the quality of financial reporting. (c) 2022, Institute of Economic Sciences.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the relationship between board demographic diversity and human rights reporting for a sample of large Western European companies. Design/methodology/approach: Grounded on resource dependence theory, the authors hypothesize that greater gender, age and nationality diversities will translate into enhanced levels of human rights reporting. The authors use ordinal logistic regression analysis to analyze the association between these types of board diversity and such reporting. Findings: The findings suggest that the companies in the sample attribute little importance to the reporting of information pertaining to the issue of human rights. They also suggest that only the diversity of nations represented in the board of directors is significant in explaining this type of reporting. Research limitations/implications: The sample includes only large companies from Western Europe and the analysis covers only one year. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study provides the first empirical analysis of factors influencing human rights reporting conducted on a multiple-country setting. It is also the first investigating the association between boards of directors' demographic diversity and such reporting.

In this study, I examine the effectiveness of a national board gender diversity disclosure requirement, which is, arguably, on the "soft" end of the continuum of boardroom interventions. Using a panel dataset of 1847 hand-collected corporate disclosures from 2015 to 2018, I perform a post-event, historical trend analysis of the efficacy of Canada's 2014 intervention. I find evidence of real progress in the 4 years following intervention against several benchmarks. Specifically, improvements in critical mass are documented, with the proportion of boards with three of more women reaching 18.8% in 2018. Tokenism remains an issue with very little change in the number of Canadian boards with only one woman. Further analyses using a sorting methodology and panel regression analysis reveal that progress toward board gender diversity is achieved by those with board gender targets, board seat renewal policies, and written board diversity policies. In addition, I find that larger companies achieve greater progress and that progress is clustered by industry. (c) 2022 W. Michael Hoffman Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.

Recently, regulators and investors have shown an increasing interest in the promotion of diversity in the corporate boards of directors. In this paper, we employ data from the Australian bank boards to provide new insights on the diversity-risk nexus, based on a dataset of the Australian banks for the period of 2004 to 2019. We examine board gender diversity from two perspectives across the board and among board leaders. Our results support the context-dependent impact of gender diversity on the board of directors and highlight the beneficial impact on the risk of banks when considering gender diversity and the presence of a dominant gender group in the boardroom.

Research Summary: We investigate the relationship between outside board members (OBMs) and short- versus long-term strategic orientation of new ventures in the startup phase. Owing to their smallness and newness, a short-term orientation may be more desirable. Using a dataset of 170 Belgian new ventures in the startup phase, we find a positive association between the proportion of OBMs and a short- rather than long-term strategic orientation, attributed by our interviewees to concern for firm survival. This association is stronger in new ventures operating in highly competitive environments, and where the founding team performed few pre-startup activities. Greater focus on the short-term may be beneficial in the long run, as a positive association is found between a high relative short-term orientation and ventures' growth. Managerial Summary: New ventures in the startup phase should primarily focus on short-term issues: get a better understanding of who are the customers and try to validate the business model. This article reveals that the board of directors plays a pivotal role in influencing the extent to which startups have a short-term strategic orientation. Specifically, it explains how OBMs provide advice, monitor the startup's progress, and guide entrepreneurs on key short-term priorities. This strategic role of OBMs is more pronounced in new ventures where the entrepreneurial team is less prepared at founding and in firms operating in highly competitive environments. Importantly, our paper provides evidence that a short-term orientation in the startup phase does not jeopardize future venture growth in the scale-up phase. (c) 2022 Strategic Management Society.

Purpose: This study aims to evaluate changes in the presence of women on Spanish boards after the Unified Good Governance Code of Listed Companies (2006) and the Organic Law 3/2007 on Gender Equality, and this study compares the educational background of women and men directors. Also, this study analyses the influence of gender diversity and educational background of women directors on economic performance, corporate social responsibility (CSR) and, ultimately, firm value. In addition, this study explores the differences in board gender composition and its effect on firm value during the crisis and post-crisis periods. Finally, this study analyses the different influence of women directors depending on their typology. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a system of structural equations and a sample of 4,101 directors of 30 Spanish companies listed on IBEX-35 over 2008-2017. Findings: The results show that women's presence on boards has grown since 2008, and they have higher educational background than men. This study finds that women directors improve economic performance and CSR, though results are non-significant for firm value. Women directors with a bachelor's or master's degree increase economic and social performance but reduce firm value. Women directors with business or industry-related studies positively influence CSR but business specialisation negatively affects economic performance and firm value. Originality/value: This study analyses the direct and indirect effect of women directors on firm value, the influence of their educational background and the potential differences arising from the economic situation (crisis) and the type of board position they hold.

Purpose: The relationship between interlocking directorates and firm performance has been increasingly debated, with a focus on whether firm's centrality in interlock networks is associated with performance. The purpose of this study is to examine not only how a firm's position in this network is associated with performance but also how the performance of network partners can impact a firm's performance. This study examines how firms effectively utilise the interlock network to achieve the goal of higher market capitalisation - termed market capitalisation rank (MCR). Design/methodology/approach: The premise of the study is the UK FTSE 350 firms from 2014 to 2018. The paper makes use of a temporal network autocorrelation model to examine how firm characteristics, the structural position in the interlock network and the performance of network partners affect MCR over time. Findings: The analysis indicates that firms with ties (via the interlock network) to firms with high market capitalisation are more likely to enhance their own MCR, highlighting network partners have the opportunity to play a critical role in a firm's dominance strategy to optimise firm value. Originality/value: The value of this research is that it does not only look at the impact of a firm's position in the network on performance, but the impact of the performance of network partners on a firm's market performance as well.

This study examines the relationship between board gender diversity and R&D investments in the UK. Also, the study goes deeper and examines whether the relationship between board gender diversity and R&D investments is affected by the female tenure in the board. Using a sample from the UK FTSE350 index between 2009 and 2018, the findings show that board gender diversity has a positive impact on R&D intensity. Importantly, we find that this relationship is not affected by the tenure of female directors. Therefore, this result alleviates the concern that long female tenure might lead to weak monitoring, thereby adversely impacting the relationship between gender diversity and R&D investments. The findings hold after using different proxies for gender diversity and after controlling for endogeneity. The study injects the literature with up-to-date evidence on the role of female directors in R&D investment in the UK where female representation in the board is still optional. Moreover, the findings of this study contribute to the merits of the tense debate on female representation in the board of directors. In this regard, given that the current regulations in the UK recommend, but do not oblige, board gender diversity, regulatory bodies (e.g., FRC) could take this issue into consideration for future governance reform. Furthermore, companies that are eager to maintain sustained innovation should pay close attention to gender diversity during the process of the directors' appointment. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

Following its 40th anniversary and more than three decades after its introduction to the strategic management literature, agency theory remains the predominant theory of corporate governance. In this paper, we examine affect, an underexplored dimension in principal-agent relationships. Using the CEO-board of directors relationship as a context, we develop a theoretical lens that explains how interpersonal affect underlying relationships between CEOs and directors of boards shapes behavior in ways that deviate from traditional agency theory predictions. We discuss how the incorporation of an affective perspective advances principal-agent research by revising agency theory's assumptions concerning human nature and behavior and suggesting new research directions. By acknowledging a central role of affect, we connect existing behavioral approaches to organizational agency and advance our understanding of socioemotional foundations of principal-agent tensions, problems, and agency costs.

This chapter investigates the role of board of directors in corporate philanthropic activities, a strand of corporate social responsibility. We find that independent boards, female directors, and directors' ownership compensation tend to increase the incidence and level of corporate charitable giving. However, the presence of business experts on the board reduces the probability and the level of charitable giving. We also find that CEO power and bonus plan reduce the propensity of companies to donate to charitable causes but have no effect on the amount donated. Yet CEO ownership tends to be positively related to charitable contributions. CEO tenure, on the other hand, positively affects corporate decisions to contribute to charitable causes as well as the extent of such CSR investment. CEO age and expertise do not exert any influence on the decision to make corporate charitable giving. However, older CEOs negatively affect amount donated. Overall, findings indicate corporate governance quality and CSR-contingent compensation contracts as a way of increasing corporate philanthropy.

Boards of directors play a central role in governing corporate strategic change. We systematically review corporate governance research on strategic change published over the past 40 years, differentiating between strategic change types and board characteristics. We identify three developments: a focus on specific strategic change types, board composition and structure, and North American listed firms as a dominant study context. Yet, our analysis of the literature shows that research on board governance of interrelated strategic changes, on different board roles and behaviour, and on the governance of strategic changes across different contexts remains underdeveloped. To address these research gaps, we suggest three future research avenues: (1) examining how boards govern interrelated changes in a strategic change portfolio and its evolution over time; (2) studying the mediating relationship between board governance (particularly different board roles and behaviour), strategic changes, and corresponding outcomes; and (3) gaining a better understanding of the role of context in board governance of interrelated strategic changes. We contribute to corporate governance research by developing a framework that synthesizes extant research on the relationships between different board governance variables and strategic change types, highlights important research gaps, and outlines several future research directions to address these gaps. Our framework and literature overview serve as analytical tools to examine whether boards are well-designed and prepared to govern multiple and interrelated strategic changes. (c) 2022 The Authors.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of firm financial and operational characteristics on the level of forward-looking information disclosure (FLID) by Egyptian-listed non-financial companies. The present research also aims to investigate the moderating role of gender diversity on the board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: The sample incorporates the non-financial companies included in the EGX 100 of the Egyptian Stock Exchange (ESE), whose reports were available during the study period from 2013 to 2018. The final sample comprises 49 companies with 294 observations. Statistical analysis is performed using multiple regression analysis. Findings: This study found a significant positive impact of return on assets, leverage, company size and age on the level FLID, while external audit firm type and industry were found to impact the level of FLID negatively. Further, the board gender diversity (BGD) is found to have a moderating impact as it strengthens the effect of financial and operational characteristics on the level of FLID. Practical implications: The present study has some implications for Egyptian companies, investors in the Egyptian market and regulators in emerging economies, which include paying more attention to BGD when selecting the board members by companies as well as following up the female representation in all the listed companies by regulators. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the moderating role of BGD and its impact on the level of FLID in emerging markets. This extends the disclosure literature as the present study brings new evidence from an emerging market regarding BGD moderating role as early research concentrated on the direct impact of BGD on the level of FLID.

Purpose: The authors examine whether internal corporate governance mechanisms are effective in curbing cash flow manipulation through real activities, misclassification, and timing. Design/methodology/approach: The sample comprises of firms from an emerging market, India with data for years 2004 through 2015. The authors use the methodology given in Roychowdhury (2006). Findings: The authors find that corporate boards in India play an active role in curbing cash flow manipulation through real activities but fail to control cash flow manipulation through misclassification and timing. Practical implications: The study suggests that corporate boards should pay more attention to the reported cash flow numbers. Regulators can reduce the opportunities available for cash flow misclassification by fixing relevant accounting and governance norms. Auditors can also help by critically focusing on the cash flow classifications presented by management. Originality/value: This study, to the authors' knowledge, is the first study that talks about the role of internal governance in a trade-off between different cash flow manipulation techniques.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted nearly every boardroom in the world. However, neither the extant leadership literature nor the corporate governance literature offers succinct guidance on what constitutes effective board leadership during such a calamity. To address this theoretical and practical need, we develop a moderated mediation model, in which directive leadership from the board chair promotes competitive simplification at the onset of the crisis, which in turn promotes firm financial performance during the crisis. Using survey responses from 120 directors of U.S. public firms in Spring of 2020, combined with firm-level archival data from multiple sources and time periods, we find support for this mediated relationship--but only if the chair is not CEO. If the chair is CEO, we find no evidence of a positive relationship between directive leadership and either competitive simplification or firm financial performance; rather, we find some evidence of a negative relationship. We explore the implications of these findings for the theory and practice of corporate governance and crisis management. (c) The Author(s) 2022.

This study aimed at identifying the effect of board size and board gender diversity on dividend payout and identifying the role of return on assets (ROA) in moderating the effect of size and board gender diversity on dividend payout. The study population consisted of (45) service shareholding companies listed in Amman Stock Exchange (ASE), during the period (2009-2018), using balanced panel data of (36) service companies with (360) observations. The results indicate that the level of female representation in the boards of service companies in Jordan is still low compared to other countries. The results also showed that board size and board gender diversity affect dividend payout. In addition, the return on assets moderates the effect of board size on dividend payout. The results also showed that the return on assets does not moderate the effect of board gender diversity on dividend payout. The study recommends that regulatory bodies should take a step towards encouraging gender diversity in boards to enhance board of directors' effectiveness, through amending legislations that regulate female participation in boards, such as the Jordanian Corporate Governance Code.

This study explores the impact of legal protection level and board characteristics on the structure and the pay-performance sensitivity of CEO compensation. To reach the declared goals, this paper is supported by Mann-Whitney test. Data from 12 European countries for the 2016-2018 period reveals a significant impact of the legal protection level, CEO duality, board size, board independence and the presence of efficient compensation committee have a significant impact on the structure of CEO compensation but not on the pay-performance sensitivity of CEO compensation. In addition, the results show that the presence of women on board of directors has a positive impact on CEO's compensation. Present study contributes to literature in the fields of gender study and corporate governance of the firms. Also, present research has several managerial implications, highlighting the impact of legal protection and board characteristics on CEO compensation. Copyright (c) 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Innovation is a key factor for firms' competitive advantage in the long-term and for their financial success. Scholars highlight the underinvestment problem with respect of R&D investment. This chapter focuses on two relevant variables of corporate governance that influence firms' innovation performance: firm ownership and board of directors. In the first section, the effect of ownership structure on R&D investment is analyzed. More specifically, the chapter will illustrate the effects of family ownership and institutional ownership on innovation investments. The second section explores the main theoretical perspectives investigating the functions of board of directors and the main board tasks. Lastly, three attributes of board structure and their effect on R&D investments are explored. (c) 2022 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.

Despite the increase in the number of studies analysing innovation in family firms over the last decade, there are still a number of critical issues that are far from being resolved. One of these issues is related to the influence of women's presence in corporate governance structures on firms' innovation outcomes. In light of this, the aim of the present chapter is to investigate whether the inclusion of women in private family firms' corporate governance structures, namely, in the general shareholders' meeting, the top management team and board of directors, influences firms' innovation. By applying regression analyses to a sample of 339 Spanish private family firms, the findings reveal that the presence of women in general shareholders' meetings and in top management teams has a negative and significant effect on innovation.

Employee share ownership offers the workforce an opportunity to participate in the growth of their company via two mechanisms: profit sharing and power sharing. Profit sharing has been widely studied in the academic literature. Power sharing, on the other hand, has received little attention--notably in the form of the presence of a director representing the interests of employees who own shares on governance bodies. We study 10 French companies with employee shareholder representation on governance bodies, and our findings reveal the dual nature of the role. On the one hand, the participation of employee shareholders in governance bodies seems to have an influence on the disciplinary, partnership, cognitive and behavioural levels. On the other hand, it can be a source of entrenchment, as tensions that are specific to this little-known mandate reflect tensions within the company itself.

This chapter provides readers some theoretical connections between board busyness and stability of banks. As such, some knowledge about the busyness of the board of directors in the dual banking system (i.e., Islamic versus Conventional banks) will be discussed. This will be followed by the theoretical linkage between Shari'ah governance busyness and banking outcomes. Next, researchers and students will be introduced to some empirical evidence in this field, so that they can better visualise how the theoretical link between board busyness and bank outcomes was empirically examined in academics. Interestingly, this chapter provides researchers and students some good directions for endogeneity problems existing in corporate governance and board busyness research and some suggested methodology that could address such issues.

The objective of this study is to examine the role that the specialized committees, created within the board of directors, and the auditor play in relation to the hiring of a non-financial information assurance service and in relation to the choices of the assurance provider for such non-financial information. Specifically, this study analyses the effect of the independence and specialisation of the audit committee, the existence of a CSR committee, and the reputation of the financial auditor associated with its classification as Big4. The results indicate that those responsible for financial information do not show interest in contracting an assurance service, especially if it is realized by an accountant provider, except that the information is standardised according to the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines and the contracted service is comparable to the financial audit standards, has assurance for a reasonable/high level, and is carried out according to the ISAE3000 standard.

On the basis of the view that the board's evaluation of the CEO is determined by the board decision-making as a group, we adopt the faultline approach to analyze group dynamics in the board. Faultlines can split a board based on the alignment of multiple attributes of individual directors and potentially create subgroups within the board. In this study, we argue that different types of faultlines have distinct effects on board decision-making. Specifically, we predict that demographic faultlines can increase conflicts among directors, hampering the board's ability to decide on CEO dismissal when firm performance is below the aspiration level. On the other hand, information-based faultlines can facilitate exchange of diverse knowledge and elaboration of alternative perspectives, which can improve the board's ability to dismiss a CEO when firm performance is below the aspiration level. Our analysis of S&P 500 boards supports our prediction that board faultlines based on demographic attributes of directors significantly reduce the board's ability to fire the CEO when firm performance is below the aspiration level, whereas faultlines based on information-related attributes magnify the board's ability to dismiss a poor-performing CEO. By demonstrating different effects of faultlines based on heterogenous types of director attributes, this study contributes to the board faultline literature. We also contribute to CEO dismissal research by showing how group dynamics of boards moderates the relationship between firm performance and CEO dismissal. (c) The Author(s) 2022.

Purpose: This paper examines the evolution and determinants of the extent and quality of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure in a developing country (Mauritius). Design/methodology/approach: CSR disclosures from annual reports of all listed companies were hand-collected for a 12-year period (2007-2018). The extent of disclosure was measured using a dichotomous index (41 items) while the quality of each disclosure item was assessed on a three-point scale. We rely on organisational legitimacy and resource dependence theories to investigate (1) trends in CSR disclosure extent and quality (2) the role of selected board and firm characteristics, namely the business qualifications of board members, extent of cross-directorships and the firm's use of employee volunteering scheme, on CSR disclosure. Findings: CSR disclosure extent, notably in relation to environment and human resources, gradually increased to an overall score of 45%. Comparatively, the quality of disclosures was low, with an average score of 20%. The proportion of business-qualified directors is only positively associated with CSR disclosure extent. The extent of cross-directorships is negatively associated with CSR disclosure quality while employee volunteering is positively associated with disclosure extent and quality. Originality/value: The findings reveal the relatively low quality of information being disclosed, and in spite of CSR and governance reforms, there seems to be limited influence from the board of directors and their networks; prompting a call to foster greater board engagement on CSR matters. The results also highlight the need for a multi-dimensional assessment of CSR disclosure. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper examines whether gender diversity (GD) on corporate boards influences financial performance (FP) of Indian firms using System Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) methods by considering panel data of 364 firms during 2017 to 2021, comprising of 1820 firm-year observations. The study reveals that the mere presence of a woman director (WD) on boards makes no difference in financial performance. Presence of WDs as a significant portion of the boards and their active roles in the functioning and governance of companies positively contribute to firms' financial performances and economic value creation. Regarding other governance parameters, the study shows that larger boards do not necessarily improve firm performance. Also, independent directors do not necessarily add value to corporate performance and value creation. While a higher promoter's stake is an important factor for Indian companies to drive corporate performance, firms with separate CEO and chairperson outperform firms with CEO duality. The study also reveals that the covid 19 pandemic has negatively influenced the financial performance and economic profit generation of the Indian firms. This study is important for several reasons. First, this study considers the period (2017-2021) when Indian companies adopted new financial reporting practices (IND-AS) in line with International Financial Reporting System (IFRS), the mandatory quota system of women directors' appointment is implemented and new corporate governance norms are implemented. Hence, our study contributes to the literature by proving meaningful insights on the role of gender diversity and other corporate governance parameters on financial performance of Indian firms in the light of newly adopted accounting and financial reporting practices. Second, few previous India based studies have mostly used pooled OLS or fixed effect models, and did not address the endogeneity problem in different forms like Dynamic Endogeneity, Simultaneity, and Unobserved Heterogeneity. This paper addresses the endogeneity problem appropriately by using the system generalized method of moments (GMM) while modelling the relation between WDs and firms' FP. Therefore, the findings of this study are more reliable and unbiased and can be useful for effective policy making on gender diversity and corporate governance issues. Third, few prior studies which have looked into the role of WDs on FP of Indian firms, have mostly used return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and Tobin's Q as performance parameters. Here, in addition to ROA, ROE and Tobin's Q, we also use economic value added (EVA) as indicators of corporate performance to understand the role of WDs on economic value creation for companies. The EVA is considered as modern technique to measure the economic profit earned by a firm, and it has gained huge popularity among companies as an improved technique for measuring financial performance for companies. To the best of our knowledge, the role of WDs on economic value creation by firms has not been investigated before particularly in the Indian context. This is another unique contribution of this study. Fourth, the Covid 19 pandemic had impacted global economy severely and India was no exception. Financial performances of most Indian firms were negatively impacted due to the nationwide lockdown and uncertainties about production, revenue and earnings. This study considers both the pre and post Covid 19 pandemic period in examining our central research question using a year dummy. Therefore, our study also captures whether the covid 19 pandemic has actually impacted the financial performance of Indian firms, while modelling this relation. This is another valuable and unique contribution of this study to the literature. The findings of this study provide an understanding of how board gender diversity and other governance parameters influence financial performance of Indian firms in an emerging market context. The outcomes are also explained and aligned with the relevant policy implications in the light of recent Indian corporate governance norms and policies. These findings are useful to the companies and policymakers, as they can use these findings while designing effective boards, which can be useful in improving firm performance. Board of directors, investors, regulators, and policymakers can effectively use these findings to understand how gender diverse boards and other corporate governance parameters influence firms' financial performance under the concentrated ownership pattern.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the impact of corporate governance (CG) on sustainability disclosure (SD) from the perspectives of resource dependence, agency and stakeholder theories in the context of Jordan. Design/methodology/approach: The analyses were based on 405 observations from non-financial firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange, spanning the period of 2014-2018. The CG that influences SD was examined using panel data regression models. Findings: The results of the current study show a positive and significant relationship between the extent of SG and the audit committee and board of directors' effectiveness. In terms of ownership structure, both institutional and foreign ownerships yielded an insignificant relationship with the extent of SDs. Practical implications: The analyses have implications for practitioners, policymakers, top management and corporate executives. Firms are encouraged to restructure their board of directors to enhance the effectiveness of the board to better monitor and support better SD. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to examine the determinants of SD in Jordan firms. This paper adopted a newly developed global reporting initiative-based reporting index that identifies companies with good sustainability practices. This adds value to the existing sustainability literature. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of human capital related to gender and nationality diversity in boards of directors on the innovation of university spin-offs (USOs) in their entrepreneurial ecosystem. Following the intellectual capital (IC) framework and the resource dependence theory, upper echelons theory and critical mass theory, it hypothesizes that the relationship between board diversity and USOs' firm innovation is non-linear. Design/methodology/approach: To test the research hypotheses empirically, a sample of 827 Italian USOs over the period 2009-2018 was analyzed using zero-inflated Poisson regression modeling. A robustness test was also performed. Findings: Gender obstacles remain in USOs' entrepreneurial ecosystem, with little involvement of women in boards, and the benefits of human capital for firm innovation emerge with increased female representation. Nevertheless, a few foreign-born directors embody valued IC in terms of human capital from an internationally linked entrepreneurial ecosystem, which decreases with more foreign-born directors due to communication costs and coordination problems. Research limitations/implications: The emerging non-linear relationships imply that gender- and nationality-diverse boards in USOs constitute critical human capital factors boosting the devolvement of entrepreneurial processes, in terms of firm innovation, in university entrepreneurial ecosystems. Originality/value: This study contributes significantly to the move from traditional corporate governance analysis through an IC framework, fostering an understanding of the role of human capital and its diversity determinants in spurring firm innovation among USOs considering the university entrepreneurial ecosystem.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of Board of Directors Effectiveness (BODE) on the performance of Malaysian Takaful companies licensed by the Central Bank of Malaysia. In addition, the study investigates the moderating effect of Shariah Committee Quality (SCQ) on the relationship between BODE and companies' performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a sample of 11 Malaysian Takaful companies during the period of 2010-2017. While BDE and SCQ are measured using indices, performance is proxied using ROA and ROE. A panel fixed effect regression analysis is used to test the impact of the BDE on the financial performance of Malaysian Takaful companies and the moderator role of SCQ. Findings: The main finding of this study shows a positive association between BDE and performance. More specifically, boards with a high presence of independent, Muslim and female directors positively contribute to the performance of Malaysian Takaful companies. Another interesting finding is related to the positive moderating effect of SCQ on the relationship between BDE and performance. This result indicates that a high level of SCQ combined with a high level of board effectiveness improve performance. Practical implications: The finding is of great importance to stakeholders and policymakers to improve their board effectiveness and the quality of the Shariah committee to reduce agency costs and to improve the performance of Malaysian Takaful companies. Originality/value: This study adds to the prior literature by investigating for the first time the relationship between BDE and performance and the interaction effect of SCQ on the performance of Malaysian Takaful companies.

Board composition has received increasingly more attention from scholars as an important determinant of environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. Two factors of board composition receive attention as they strongly relate to sustainability issues: gender diversity and board independence. The aim of this study is to test whether the presence of a critical mass of women in boardrooms correlates with firm ESG performance. In addition, we aim to study whether women receiving appointment as executive rather than nonexecutive directors may positively influence ESG performance. Using a sample of Italian companies listed on the Mercato Telematico Azionario during 2003-2019, the empirical results show that a critical mass of at least three female directors is necessary to improve ESG performance and that executive women directors represent a crucial component of board mechanisms, in terms of aligning the needs of stakeholders, since they increase ESG performance. Because the advising and monitoring functions impact firm value, we support the idea that female directors in strategic positions in the boardroom may benefit ESG performance. Thus, we support the idea of increasing women's presence on corporate boards and across executive leadership as a measure and a signal of how firms can respond to ESG challenges.

The current study looked at the impact of board of director characteristics on corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the Pakistani setting. The study further added to the body of knowledge by comparing the impact of board characteristics in family versus non-family businesses in an emerging market. The study's sample consists of 139 non-financial Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) listed firms from 2008 to 2019. The level of CSR among sample firms was assessed using a multidimensional financial approach. The random-effect model was employed to test the study's hypotheses. The findings support the dysfunctional view of the role of the board of directors' in family-owned businesses. Overall, board size and CEO duality have a significant negative impact on CSR, whereas board independence has a significant positive impact. While these findings applied to both family-owned and non-family-owned businesses. It was discovered that among family-owned businesses, boards tend to look after the interests of family members, and thus are less likely to support CSR. The findings of this study will assist regulatory authorities, investors, and financial analysts in understanding CSR practices in Pakistani firms, allowing them to review the role of the board of directors in CSR among family and non-family-owned firms.

The present study examines the relationship between the diverse board of directors and firm performance using a panel data sample of the top 73 EU nonfinancial sustainable firms across 13 countries from 2016 to 2020 based on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI). We specifically examine the impact of structural (board independence) and demographical (age, gender, education, tenure and industry experience) board diversity on firm performance. Drawing on the agency and resource base perspective, the results indicate that firms with a diverse board of directors (structural and demographic) perform significantly better with firm performance. Additionally, when viewed through the lens of stakeholder theory, the findings indicate that environmental, social and governance disclosure (ESG) moderates and partially mediates the relationship between the diverse board of directors and firm performance. We also performed robust checks to validate our results. Diversity contributes to a firm's understanding of its market and, as a result, its overall performance. The current study demonstrates a considerable gap between the theoretical and empirical support for various board indicators (structural and demographic), their relationship to performance, and how ESG acts as an intervening element in increasing firm financial performance.

Purpose: This paper aims to present a catalogue of the influential aspects resulting from a bibliometric meta-analysis of political connection literature. Design/methodology/approach: This study undertakes a bibliometric meta-analysis review of political connections literature, covering 138 research papers from 2000 to 2020 using the visualization of similarities viewer program. Findings: The authors identify six research groups: the value of political connections; political connections and finance; political connections in banks; political connections and debt; management and political connections; and political connections and governance. This study discusses each stream through a cartographic analysis, including co-authorship, countries and time networks. Originality/value: This study makes an important and novel contribution to political connection literature. So far, to the best of the authors' knowledge, it is the only bibliometric study on political connections. This study is the first to use network analysis and community detection to understand social clustering and to identify main research steams in political connection literature.

We explore the extent to which board political connections shape the firm's disclosure behavior. We focus on the disclosure of non-GAAP earnings measures and argue that board political connections reduce the firm's propensity to report non-GAAP earnings through two mechanisms: the reduction in capital market pressure (insulating effect) and the concerns about public scrutiny (constraining effect). Our theory is tested and supported by an analysis of U.S.-listed firms in the period 2003-2019. We further exploit the variation in firms' media exposure to identify the primary mechanism underlying this disclosure strategy and find that the constraining effect plays a more important role than the insulating effect in driving the financial reporting behavior of politically connected firms.

Meta-analytic results show that board gender diversity is modestly associated with firm performance, but there is notable heterogeneity among findings. Board gender diversity allows access to women's perspectives, potentially helping boards, but diversity can also trigger biases that exclude women directors, such that boards do not integrate meaningful perspectives. Addressing this problem, we leverage the categorization-elaboration model, contact theory, and critical mass theory to build new theory as to how men directors can serve as allies to women directors to better leverage diverse perspectives. We empirically test how considerations that reduce out-group categorization and bias against women moderate the board gender diversity-firm performance relationship. Our results show that gender diverse boards perform better with more formal contact among men and women director colleagues, and that gender diverse boards with more men directors who only have prior experience working with token-women, perform worse. Our work helps explain how and why board gender diversity can improve or detract from firm performance. This extends the literature by illustrating the important consequences that occur when firms do (or do not) have men directors who are likely to be allies of gender diversity.

Purpose: Cybersecurity disclosure (CSD) provides users with valuable information and significant insights about a firm's susceptibility to cyber risk and its management. It is argued that the board of directors, with its oversight role, should be vigilant in managing cyber risk and disclosures. This study aims to measure the extent of CSD of the banking companies and examines the association between the characteristics of board composition (i.e. board size, board independence and gender diversity) and CSD. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted automated content analysis to find out the extent of CSD in the listed commercial banks of an emerging country, Bangladesh, where CSD is voluntary. Further, multiple linear regression is applied to determine the relationship between board composition and CSD. Findings: The findings reveal an increasing trend of CSD over the sample period (2014-2020). The study confirms a significant positive relationship between board independence and CSD. The study also demonstrates that the higher presence of female directors on the board is associated with higher CSD. However, no consistently significant relationship is found between board size and CSD. Research limitations: The study is based on listed banking companies only. Hence, the results can not be generalised to companies in other sectors. Also, it is important to acknowledge that we focused on the quantity (not the quality) of CSD contained in annual reports. Practical implications: The study provides an overall understanding of current trends of CSD in the Banking sector of a developing country. Regulators may use our findings to understand the current level of CSD and assess the need for issuing guidance in this regard. The association between board composition and CSD has implications both for banks when selecting board members and policymakers when establishing requirements concerning board composition under corporate governance guidelines. Originality/value: This is one of the very few studies in the context of an emerging economy where CSD is voluntary. The paper contributes to a narrow stream of research investigating CSD and its association with board composition. Notably, it contributes to understanding how board composition is associated with CSD in the banking industry, which is highly exposed to cyber risk. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

For several decades, the boards of directors have been relatively homogeneous groups consisting of white old men (the so-called 'good-old boys'). This static and apparently immutable feature has been changed recently, as social movements and the evolution of corporate law and good governance codes promoted an increasing diversity in the boardroom. In parallel with the diffusion of more diverse boards, leadership and governance scholars have started to analyze the consequences of board diversity. Based on the idea that members' diversity increases group experiences and viewpoints, most scholars argued that higher board diversity positively affects board decisions and firm outcomes. However, despite the soundness of this perspective and the number of previous studies, the empirical evidence provides only partial, mixed and inconclusive findings. Building on these premises, we did a systematic and interdisciplinary literature review aimed at taking stock of our understanding of board diversity's antecedents and consequences. Our analysis and critical assessment of 184 studies synthesizes major results, identifies main gaps, and highlights important avenues for further research. Finally, we outline several ways to overcome current (theoretical and methodological) barriers and further advance research on board diversity. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

In recent decades, there has been a growing demand for companies to take responsibility for the adverse social and environmental effects caused by their activities. As a result, they are no longer only accountable for their economic performance but also their corporate social responsibility. An important pillar of corporate social responsibility is gender diversity in the company as a whole and on the board of directors in particular. The hospital sector, whose activity in itself requires social responsibility, was later than other sectors in its disclosure. This research aims to analyze the influence of corporate social responsibility, together with gender diversity on boards of directors and the COVID-19 pandemic, on the profitability of Spanish private hospitals. In addition, this research studies the dissemination of COVID-19 throughout the Spanish territory, relating wealth and risk. For this purpose, data corresponding to the period 2017-2020 were analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis, cluster analysis, and factor analysis. The results show that those socially responsible hospitals show higher profitability, but no causal relationship has been established. Gender diversity negatively influences the profitability of the private hospital sector, although it can be considered non-significant. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the profitability of hospitals, causing a sharp drop. The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic was mainly influenced by the population density of the territories but also by public health investment, showing a greater propensity to control the pandemic in those regions that allocate more funds to health care.

Endowed with significant firm-specific knowledge, inside directors can contribute to the decision-making processes of the boardroom. However, regulatory changes, focusing primarily on the monitoring function of the boards, have driven inside directors out of the boardroom. This article argues that suppliers with firm- and industry-specific knowledge are uniquely positioned to fill a critical void in boardrooms. It also suggests that the value of having a supplier on the board (SOTB) is influenced by environmental contingencies faced by a firm: operational efficiency, diversification, and demand uncertainty. Using an objective measure of supplier presence in the boardroom, the authors find that a supplier's presence enhances firm performance. They also find that the value of an SOTB in enhancing performance is greater in firms with lower operational efficiency and higher demand uncertainty and, is lower in firms with higher diversification. These results are robust to potential endogeneity issues, alternative estimation methods, and measures of moderator and outcome variables. (c) 2022 Production and Operations Management Society.

Recently, companies in the energy sector have faced multiple financial and environmental risks. This finding demonstrates the need for energy companies to disclose risk information. However, academic attention on risk disclosure (RD) remains limited. Through manual content analysis and a regression model, this study examines the effect of the features of the board of directors and audit committee on the RD level in sustainability reports. The empirical findings reveal that the size and independence of the board of directors and the size of the audit committee positively affect the RD level. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd

George Floyd's murder caused many firms to reveal how exposed they are to racial diversity issues. We examine investor and firm behaviors after this socially significant event to provide evidence on the valuation effects of the exposure and ensuing corporate responses. We develop a text-based measure of a firm's exposure to racial diversity issues from conference call transcripts and find that, after the murder of George Floyd, firms with diversity exposure experience a stock price decrease of approximately 0.7% around the date of the conference call. We provide evidence that this effect is attributable to race-related exposure and not gender-related exposure. Initiatives taken by firms mitigate the negative market reaction. We document that firms with racial diversity exposure respond by appointing Black directors. The stock market views appointments of Black directors more favorably after George Floyd's murder, except when they are perceived as symbolic. We also find that firms with greater exposure to racial diversity are more likely to establish diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) departments, appoint DEI leaders, specify diversity goals, increase supply chain diversity, and donate to racial justice causes. Our paper provides evidence that exposure to racial diversity issues adversely affects firm value, and companies address the exposure by taking actions.

This paper examines the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) disclosure in the utilities sector. We collected data from the Eikon Refinitiv database on 265 worldwide organisations operating in the utility sector during the 2011-2019 period. Findings evidence that board independence and the existence of a specific Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)/sustainability committee constitute positive drivers of utilities' overall ESG disclosure levels. Also, board size positively influences environmental and social disclosure. The study would encourage utilities to define their internal corporate governance mechanisms carefully, devoting primary attention to an accurate selection of the board of directors members.

Based on resource dependence theory we argue for an influence of business groups (BGs) on the board composition of constituent offshore financial multinational enterprises (FMNEs). Using a unique sample of 171 Caribbean FMNEs in an inter-island BG setting, we find BGs' control in constituent firms to be indicative of the importance of the internal financing and intermediation within the group network. This control leads to a higher proportion of lawyers hired to the boards of directors in BG-constituent firms and supports the argument that lawyers provide skills in complex offshore regulatory frameworks that facilitate BGs' optimal tax management. Furthermore, we observe that an increased adoption of shareholder rights governance by BG-constituent firms is associated with increased engagement with outside resource providers, increased potential conflicts of interest and hence a need for hiring more lawyers. Our interpretation is that offshore FMNEs have a need for more lawyers, whose legal skill is critical to the competitive advantage of FMNEs. (c) 2022 The Authors

Although the gender composition of corporate boards and the contribution of female directors to corporate governance have been previously analysed, few studies have investigated the factors that may help contribute to increasing the still scarce presence of women on boards. Therefore, using three-stage least squares (3SLS) estimation on a data panel comprising the 100 largest companies in the world according to the 2019 Fortune Global 500 ranking, including data on (re)election proposals for corporate board members, this research aims to analyse the influence of the number of men's nominations, board interlocks, director tenure, geographical area, the sector to which the firms belong, and the relevance of firms on women's nominations for boards of directors. The results show the factors that facilitate the presence of women on boards. In addition, the different influences that remain in the election of female and male directors when considering factors related to the experience, expertise, and networks of directors or the visibility of firms can also be observed. This study contributes to the knowledge of gender diversity on boards, shedding light on the factors that might lead to gender-balanced boards. It could also help companies and policymakers design strategies to build more egalitarian boards. (c) 2023 The Author(s)

Purpose: The existing literature involving director compensation has been concentrating on its absolute or intrinsic values. Although the relevant studies have generated mixed findings, research in other fields suggests that the power of an incentive may be determined by its value relative to the chosen referencing standard more than its absolute value. This study aims to investigate how relative director pay affects corporate investment efficiency. Design/methodology/approach: This study takes a fresh theoretical viewpoint by framing the investigation using the dimensional comparison theory and proposing that a directorship also presents a relative value that may influence the board's performance. Ordinary least squared regressions and two-stage system generalised method of moments are used to analyse 14,267 firm-year observations. Findings: The empirical results suggest that the relative director pay is a better estimate of the power of the incentive than the absolute pay. A positive association between the relative director pay and investment efficiency is evident, while the absolute pay has no significant effect on investment decisions. Director overcompensation, however, will cancel out the positive effect of director compensation on investment efficiency. Firms with relatively lower unexpected investment (UI) level benefit the most from an increase in the relative director pay, while neither absolute nor relative director pay affects investment choices in firms with a high UI level because of significantly more overcompensation. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first attempt to investigate the effect of relative director pay. It is also the first to examine the role of dimensional comparison in strategic decisions which is the single untended comparison framework in the director pay design. The current director pay structure has emphasised social and temporal equality by standardising the pay structure and vesting the equity-based pay over a long period. Yet it ignores the fact that people decide their commitment level by comparing the reward with an internal referent too. The findings speak to the dimensional comparison theory in that the inequality emanated from dimensional or internal comparison may be accentuated by the perceived equality in other comparison frameworks, driving the different performances in the roles one assumes.

In this chapter, the impact of board gender diversity on overall firm risk was investigated. Drawing on social identity theory, upper echelons theory, and agency theory, a hypothesis of a negative link between gender diversity on the board of directors and firm risk has been put forward. Using a panel data regression on a sample of large Tunisian companies listed on the Tunis Stock Exchange (BVMT) over the period 2016-2020, the author was able to provide empirical evidences supporting the existence of a significant negative impact of the percentage of women on boards of directors on stock return volatility as global firm risk proxy.

Purpose: This study intends to test the relationship between banks' board diversity, detected with age and gender characteristics, and banks' social performance. The resource dependence theory posits that board diversity is a strategic tool able to enrich the board of directors by expanding skills and the number of links with stakeholders, which have a strategic role in achieving a competitive advantage and sustainable goals, especially in the banking sector. Design/methodology/approach: The research hypotheses are tested using a sample of 46 European banks observed from 2009 to 2017. The gender and age diversity data of bank board members are hand-collected from banks' social reports. Findings: The empirical results show that bank social performance is positively influenced by board gender and age diversity. Thus, the human capital determined by a higher bank's board diversity constitutes an essential resource for adopting more sustainable business models. Originality/value: This paper analyses the association between board diversity and social performance, providing empirical evidence for the European banking sector in the period after the 2008 global financial crisis. The banking literature provides scarce evidence on the topic; however, the empirical results claim the strategic importance of the appointment of directors to the banks' boards to balance corporate strategy with social and environmental issues generating a positive impact on sustainable growth.

Recently, many firms that have caused direct pollution to the environment have begun to think about the necessity of environmental management. As buildings have played an important role in environmental issues, the real estate industry can no longer ignore demands for environmental management. Research on environmental management has mainly focused on its financial implications. However, there has been no consensus in the literature about the relationship between environmental management and firm performance. By comparing portfolios of environmentally certified properties of 19 lodging Real Estate Investment Trusts, this study explores the relationship between environmental management and firm performance, while taking into account the moderating role of outside board of directors. The relationship between environmental management and firm performance appeared to have mixed results, but this study found a positive moderating effect of outside board of directors. This study provides new insights into the hospitality and the real estate literature from a corporate governance perspective. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

China is facing an acute portable water problem and presents a picture of severe supply constraints. Thus, China 's water crisis offers attractive business opportunities for foreign water companies as well as domestic private water companies. Hence, the private sector participation in the Chinese water sector is a hot topic. This chapter investigates the impact of gender diversity on board of directors on the financial performance of the Chinese private water companies using ordinary least squares ( OLS ) and unbalanced panel ( random effects ) regression models, which are estimated as the baseline approach on a sample of 19 Chinese private water companies for the period of 2010-2017. The OLS and random effects results show that number of women on board (WB), percent of women on board (%WB), number of female executives (FE), and percent of female executives (%FE) affect the Chinese water companies' financial performance. The results of this chapter are important for researchers, regulators, and policymakers to benefit from policies that encourage board varieties at an individual water company level.

We study the impact of gender diversity in corporate boards on firm value by exploiting a natural experiment setting in India where the government mandated firms to appoint at least one female director on their boards. We find a significantly positive market reaction when firms comply with the mandate but only when they appoint qualified female directors who are not related to promoters. Moreover, market reward is higher for firms headquartered in states with severe gender bias. We show how regulatory intervention mitigates frictions related to gender bias to improve firm value through greater gender diversity when firms respond appropriately. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Despite increasing attention to gender diversity on corporate boards, we have only limited understanding of what occurs within the boardroom when women are present. Prior empirical research has used various theories to infer how board gender diversity may influence firm outcomes, but without identifying the theoretical mechanisms underlying women directors' influence on the board. To address this gap, we conducted interviews with women and men who have collectively served as directors with over 200 publicly listed companies in the United States and Europe. While prior research has suggested that the diverse cognitive perspectives women directors bring influence board decision-making, our study reveals novel insights as to the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, we contribute to the board gender diversity literature with the finding that women behave in ways contrary to existing board norms. By coming to board meetings highly prepared, being willing to acknowledge that they do not know something, asking questions, and getting things on the table, women impact the dialogue and interactions in the boardroom. Thus, our study sheds light on how the presence of women influences board dynamics, which has implications for corporate governance. Our findings also challenge prevailing gender theories as to how women are likely to behave, in that we do not find that women conform to gender stereotypes. Yet, we also find impediments to women directors' ability to gain influence, in that men directors may not always acknowledge them or afford them respect as equal board members.

This study investigates the association between a CEO's political ideology and Corporate Environmental Performance. Although previous research has established a strong association between a CEO's political ideology and overall performance on Corporate Social Responsibility, little research has examined how it relates to a firm's environmental impact. Utilizing data on CEO political donations, this study shows that a CEO's liberalism generally has a positive effect on a firm's environmental performance. However, this relationship can be influenced by the political conservatism of the board of directors. Furthermore, liberal CEOs are inclined to prioritize environmental strength and minimize environmental concerns. This research provides insight into the intricate dynamics of how a CEO's political ideology, as well as that of the board of directors, can influence a firm's environmental performance.

The present work aimed to shed light on the effect of board gender diversity (BGD) on real earnings management (REM) as well as the moderating role of auditor reputation in the association between BGD and REM using panel data of 1162 French non-financial firm-year observations from the SBF120 index during the period 2005-2019. Our findings show that BGD is negatively related to REM. Furthermore, we found that this relationship is more prominent in firms with higher auditor reputation mainly because highly reputable auditors aim to preserve their image and are more likely to detect earnings management activities.

The article focuses on the implications of women directors for strategic disclosure by exploring their influence on the quality of business plan in terms of information comprehensiveness. To this aim, by using hand-collected data and combining content analysis with OLS regression, it examines a sample of publicly listed non-financial Italian firms. Findings show that, while the presence of a critical mass of women on board negatively influences the quality of business plan, women CFOs positively affect such strategic planning tool. Therefore, by showing that women directors influence the quality of one of the most effective strategic planning and communication tools, the study extends the research on the role of women for the strategic decision-making process and outcomes. It also enriches the literature on the determinants of the business plan and strategic disclosure by exploring how women directors prompt the related quality. Following the recent increasing attention of policy-makers towards the necessity to foster the women's involvement in company activity that has been also strongly pushed by the socio-economical COVID-19 consequences, the article informs firms and practitioners about the beneficial implications of appointing women in apical positions for the level of company strategic disclosure quality.

Purpose: One of the most active areas of study in the field of corporate governance, board interlocks is a phenomenon that is both pervasive and perplexing. This paper aims to examine and integrate the empirical research on board interlocks to fill the void left by the lack of a recent review. Design/methodology/approach: The bibliometric analysis methodology, which emphasizes methodological rigor and transparency, was used to analyze the board interlocks literature. Eighty publications published since 2000 were chosen as the subject of this research because they reveal the key contributions to the field of board interlocks. Additionally, their clustering pattern is also identified. Findings: The authors classify various studies conducted on board interlocks into three clusters: "Social Capitalization", "Antecedents and Outcomes" and "Corporate Governance". Originality/value: This literature review helps better comprehend the board interlocks literature by pointing out several areas of study that, if pursued, would add to the existing body of knowledge and open future research directions.

Research summary: Drawing on research about power and faultlines, we identify the subgroup of directors in the board who share the same social identities with the CEO (i.e., CEO subgroup) and develop a concept of CEO subgroup power. We examine how CEO subgroup power affects the board's decision to dismiss the CEO, particularly when the firm experiences a performance decline. Using data from S&P 500 boards from 1998 to 2018, we find that powerful CEO subgroups reduce the risk of CEO dismissal and that the negative effect of CEO subgroup power on CEO dismissal is magnified when the firm experiences a decline in performance. Managerial summary: Why do some boards fire the CEO when the firm is performing well, while others retain the CEO despite poor performance? We believe that looking into power dynamics among directors may help answer this question. Using data from S&P 500 boards from 1998 to 2018, we investigate how the risk of CEO dismissal varies by the power of the subgroup within the board that consists of directors who share the same social identities with the CEO (i.e., CEO subgroup). The results reveal that a powerful CEO subgroup can reduce the CEO dismissal risk and that this effect becomes stronger when the firm goes through a performance decline.

Based on agency and asymmetric information theories, the objective of this paper is to investigate whether the transparency on corporate governance is determined by strategies followed by the board of directors (liquidity, investment, capital structure, innovation and board composition impact on the corporate governance transparency). The study sample is composed by 826 observations from Latin American firms during the period 2004-2010 (128 unique firms). A two-way cluster standard errors and GMM methods have been adopted to perform the econometric analysis. Results suggest that corporate governance disclosure is attributable to changes on firm's decisions made by the board with respect to financial aspects and innovation. However, the impact upon transparency of board composition with regards to female directors, independence and size of boards are attributable to industry and/or country effects. Although the main limitation of the study is focused on the period of analysis, the results provide important implications for the business sector, demonstrating that the board composition and the financial and innovation strategies adopted by the board encourage greater corporate transparency, thus increasing confidence in the markets.

Purpose: The paper aims to investigate the impact of political connections and board ethnicity on the value relevance of earnings and book value in Mauritius. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on a sample of 541 Mauritian-listed firm-year observations for 2001-2016. Financial and board diversity data have been collected using the listed firms' annual reports and from reports published by the Stock Exchange of Mauritius. Political connection data was derived from the directory of Chief of State and Cabinet members. The research hypotheses were empirically tested using a modified Ohlson (1995) price model. Findings: This study shows that political connections negatively impact the value relevance of earnings and book value. The authors find that firms with Franco-Mauritian directors will constrain political connections' negative impact. The authors find contrasting results for Indo-Mauritian directors since they form an integral part of the government in Mauritius. Originality/value: This study contributes to the scarce accounting literature in Mauritius. Firstly, no study has investigated the relationship between the value relevance of accounting information and political connections in Mauritius. Secondly, Mauritius's capital market is dominated by a non-indigenous ethnic group, Franco-Mauritians, who remain the economic elite. Hence, Mauritius presents an opportunity to bring forth another important aspect in the capital market and corporate governance; diversity on the board of directors. Therefore, the study extends to the political connections and board diversity literature. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This study examines the association between internal corporate governance mechanisms (i.e. board of directors and audit committee) and the information value of bank earnings. The authors comparatively assess this association across different bank types, Islamic versus conventional banks. The authors also investigate the mediating effect of Shariah governance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors utilize a unique and an international sample of 723 bank-year observations representing 100 listed banks from 16 countries during the period 2007-2015. The authors investigate the characteristics of the board of directors and audit committee (i.e. size and independence) and employ three core analyses for earnings informativeness (i.e. earnings persistence, cash flow predictability and reliability of loan loss provisions). Additional analyses address Shariah supervisory boards' (SSBs') size, financial expertise and multiple outside directorships. The authors use the random-effect Generalised Least Squares (GLS) estimation technique and provide several robustness checks and sensitivities. Findings: The authors find that, on average, having large and independent boards (and audit committees) increases the informativeness of reported earnings for banks. Conditional on bank type, our results report strong evidence for differential effects across the two alternative banking systems. In Islamic banks, large and independent board of directors (and audit committees) is positively associated with all measures of information value. There is insignificant evidence for conventional banks. However, SSBs show no significant effect on the reported earnings' informativeness. Originality/value: This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, that empirically and comparatively assesses the information value of reported earnings in association with effective internal governance while recognizing the institutional characteristics of different bank types. The authors offer new insights to policymakers, investors and other stakeholders located within countries operating on a dual banking system. The results could help regulators to improve their rules/guidance related to double-layer governance and financial reporting quality. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We analyze the impact of women on corporate boards of directors on product quality. We innovate firstly by integrating the broad but fragmented research on the topic, offering a first simultaneously testing of a larger set of variables identified to be significant in earlier studies. Second, we add alternative indicators of female representation in board of directors as a potential determinant of product quality. Third, we use evaluation scores of goods by the nonprofit foundation "Stiftung Warentest" as a quality indicator, thus adding to a regionally diversified evidence. We find a significant positive effect of female board directors on product quality. (c) 2023, The Author(s).

Purpose: The empirical study aims to examine the impact of board diversity with respect to gender and nationality on firm performance in an emerging economy. This research further splits the sample into family and non-family domains and investigates the diversity-performance nexus in isolation. Design/methodology/approach: The sample consists of 183 listed companies in Bangladesh over the period 2007 to 2017. This study employed the generalised method of moments (GMM) technique to address the possible endogeneity issue in the governance-performance connection. To underscore the strength of diversity, three distinctive assessment measures were used: percentage representation of females and foreign directors, the Blau index and the Shannon index. Findings: The results for the full sample models reveal that board heterogeneity regarding both female and foreign directors positively and significantly influences firm performance as measured by return on assets (ROA). Further to this, female directors in family-owned businesses have a positive association with profitability, whereas foreign nationals demonstrate a significant positive association with performance in non-family firms. Additionally, at least three women directors are needed to make a positive difference in profitability; however, a sole director with foreign nationality is capable of demonstrating a similar impact on performance. Practical implications: The findings are significant for policymakers and organisations that advocate diversity on corporate boards of directors, and the minimum number of diverse board members needs to be considered depending on the identity to bring about a significant change in organisational outcome. Therefore, the findings of this study may be applied to other emerging economies with similar institutional characteristics. Originality/value: This study reinforces the existing stock of knowledge on the impact of board diversity on the profitability of firms, especially in the context of an emerging economy - Bangladesh. Irrespective of the given backdrop, this study finds that both gender and nationality diversity in the case of Bangladesh is found to have a positive and significant effect on financial performance with respect to all the diversity metrics, i.e. the proportionate number of female and foreign directors on the boards, the Blau index and the Shannon index.

Purpose: Do women contribute to performance of companies on which they serve as board of directors? Many prior studies examine this issue, but no consensus is reached on the benefits of women taking on leadership positions. The present study considers this thorny issue from a slightly different perspective. Does the association between gender diversity and business performance vary across sectors and economic cycles? Design/methodology/approach: The sample for this study was derived from the firms included in the S&P Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) 300 Index, and the study period of 2004-2016 allowed authors to consider the effects of different sectors as well as different economic cycles on the relationship between gender diversity of boards and business performance. The authors consider the Australian context, which is somewhat unique from the other Western countries, as quotas on boards of directors are not made mandatory and the corporate governance practices are principle-based rather than rule-based. Findings: Employing panel data models, at the aggregate level, the authors find no evidence of board gender diversity impacting business performance. Consideration of sectoral differences and economic cycles in the empirical analyses yielded additional insights. In particular, gender diversity has a beneficial association with performance for businesses in the services and financial sectors after the changes to corporate governance guidelines relating to diversity in 2010. These economic benefits, however, are not evidenced in the resources sector. Research limitations/implications: These findings offer support for critical mass and resource dependence theories. Practical implications: The findings of this study have implications for inclusion and diversity policies of businesses and the society. Specifically, the findings offer support for gender diversity of corporate boards of directors. Originality/value: This study highlights that women bring their unique skills and experiences to create economic value in sectors where they traditionally have more experience and opportunities.

Drivers of environmentally conscious firm behaviour have gained increasing attention over past decades. The Board of Directors holds a central role in corporate decision-making, and previous empirical evidence suggests that its characteristics could influence corporate environmental performance. This paper contributes to the literature with the first evidence of the influence certain board characteristics have on whether a firm ultimately supports one or more environmental SDGs. Our focus is on board size, gender diversity, board independence and CEO duality. Logistic and fractional regressions on 4417 globally listed firms highlight that board size, the share of female directors, and the share of independent directors are significant drivers of support for environmental SDGs. The results and insights revealed in this study should be helpful to policymakers, investors and corporations in evaluating the effectiveness of corporate governance characteristics and fostering corporate contributions to the 2030 Agenda.

Our paper analyses the characteristics of the boards of directors of the best performing listed Italian banks during the last global financial crisis (from 2008 to 2015). Through a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), the study identifies three different board configurations (archetypes) that these banks adopted: a committee-based board, a gender diversity-based board, and a large size-based board. Although different in some of their characteristics, these configurations share the rationale of favouring the advisory services that the board can provide to managers in their decision-making activities. These services, in turn, are particularly valuable in a time of high risk and uncertainty for banks. With its results, the paper contributes to the literature on the relationship between board characteristics and organisational performance and to a better understanding of the configurations that can best serve when firms' decision-making, for various reasons, becomes particularly complex and can benefit from board support. Our results also contribute to further detail the governance characteristics of banks in the Italian context. Copyright (c) 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

How private firms can overcome their unique governance challenges remains an important but understudied topic. Using novel data on more than 28,000 private firms in India from 1988 to 2017, we examine whether private firms can improve their survival prospects by having board interlocks with public firms and, specifically, interlocks whereby a public firm director subsequently joins the private firm's board. In our data, we found a U-shaped relationship between the number of incoming board interlocks and the probability of private firm exit. We also found that board interlocks formed by public firm directors of public firms audited by Big Four companies improve private firms' survival more than other interlocks, consistent with the notion that such interlocks improve monitoring at private firms. Overall, our study points toward the importance of considering the role of incoming board interlocks when explaining private firm survival. (c) The Author(s) 2023.

Purpose: This paper aims to analyze the thematic content of research addressing the relation between board of directors (BoD) and business transformation (BT) to obtain better understanding of status and to derive future areas of study. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews literature through a bibliometric analysis based on co-occurrence of articles published in Web of Science Core Collection (tm) (WoS) between 1990 and 2022, identifying key concepts, setting network of relations and identifying the strategic importance of clusters of concepts. Findings and implications are discussed, future lines of research are presented and limitations are noted. Findings: Thematic research on boards addressing transformation shifted from the analysis of individuals' traits to an organizational approach with majority of research centered on the role of boards under different theories and the consequences of strategic changes on firm's performance. Further research is around gender diversity, sustainability and the moderating role of ownership structure and business culture. Research limitations/implications: Some limitations are also noted. This analysis considered articles indexed by WoS for Q1+Q2 publications as source of literature, while including others such as Scopus would increase knowledge base. Also, to identify main streams of research, the authors considered keywords with cumulative occurrence spanning from 30% to 40% while increasing this percentage would add terms that might improve precision to the connections among keywords. Other techniques could have been used such as co-citation or bibliographic coupling, although the authors find these as better suited to investigate the basic structure behind the foundational knowledge of the topic while the authors' intention was to understand the positioning of study fields regarding the degree of research progress. Practical implications: This paper presents some practical implications for future researchers. Those who wish to leverage previous evidence to address new research questions might look into principal themes covering BoD dynamics and composition to exert CG, and the relation between strategic decisions and performance measured by different variables. Those who wish to position their research as new findings to shed light on dilemmas, might find opportunities in the fields of climate change-sustainability, R&D for growth and innovation under the perspective of intangible assets. Originality/value: This paper, is the first to the best of the authors' knowledge, to identify research clusters for the intersection of boards and transformation and to determine their stage of development.

Rationale/Purpose: The Australian Football League's (AFL) governance structure is largely unique in the context of professional sports leagues, yet it has rarely been studied. This paper analyses the various components of the AFL's "Independent Commission" governance structure and draws comparisons with European football's "club-run" leagues. Method: This is a primarily conceptual paper that involves documentary analysis of constitutional documents and governance reports relating to the AFL. Findings: The AFL's governance structure is characterised by a Commission of independent members that, in stark contrast to European football, has near complete powers to run the league through the CEO. While the AFL is "owned" by its clubs, they have limited constitutional power to influence decision-making, but are able to hold the Commission accountable through their ability to elect and remove its members. A policy of "active engagement" exists within the AFL with the intention of promoting harmony between key stakeholders. Research Contribution: This paper contributes to sport governance research by presenting new insight on how the AFL's distinctive governance structure works from a constitutional perspective and highlights the efficiencies the structure (or elements thereof) may yield in other league contexts. Practical Implications: The paper provides practitioners across the sport industry with an in-depth look at an under-researched and seemingly effective league governance structure, which can inform their debates on sport governance reform.

Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the impact of family governance, including founder directors and their ties to family members on the board, on the social performance of microfinance institutions (MFIs), a special kind of social enterprise with dual objectives. Research Findings/Insights: Using a dataset of 735 MFIs operating in Bangladesh from 2007 to 2017, we find that founder directors and board members with family ties to the founder have an adverse impact on MFIs' social performance. These findings hold when we perform several robustness tests and endogeneity tests. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We contribute to the corporate governance literature on MFIs and social enterprises in two ways. First, our findings suggest that, when MFIs are confronted with dual performance objectives, founder directors may "trade off" social outcomes in favor of economic outcomes and therefore adversely affect MFIs' social performance. Second, our findings extend the literature by showing that the presence of board members with family ties to founder directors also adversely affects MFIs' social performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that MFIs' board composition influences their governance and ability to oversee their social and financial performance effectively. If MFIs' social performance is a major concern of national policy makers, then regulation should be put in place to limit board recruitment with family ties. (c) 2023 The Authors.

This study investigated the diversity of the BOD and explored its impact on corporate governance through quantitative empirical analysis. This study uniquely adopted Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporate Governance 100 Index (TWSE CG 100 Index) as the measurement of corporate governance performance. Five highly related indicators, i.e. gender, independence, education, legal, finance or accounting profession, and seniority to measure board diversity, which could be efficient variables on predicting the firms' likelihood being listed in the TWSE CG 100 Index, were used as independent variables. The results showed that board independence and the seniority of directors have a positive impact on corporate governance. This study made several important contributions. First, this study shed light on the conflicting evidence on the relationship between board diversity and firm corporate governance performance for the Taiwan economy. Second, this paper uniquely adopted TWSE CG 100 Index, and the findings can contribute to giving investors predictions about the quality of corporate governance and can serve as an incentive for corporates to enhance superior corporate governance. Furthermore, this study can contribute to practice by providing optimization suggestions for BOD composition and nomination. At last, this paper demonstrated policy justifications and implications for Taiwan government. (c) 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Purpose: Firm performance has become a thriving research field. However, a review of previous studies shows that the answers to several fundamental questions remain vague and require further investigation. Thus, the purpose of this study is twofold. The first is to determine the extent of the involvement of political connections (PCs) in Pakistani-listed companies, and the second is to examine the association between PCs and firm financial performance with director efficacy's moderating role. Design/methodology/approach: A data set of 221 non-financial companies listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange for 10 years (2008-2017) was analysed using panel-corrected standard error regression. Additionally, the authors address endogeneity issue by using Hackman two-stage estimation and lagged variables regression. Findings: The study found that PCs negatively affected the firm's financial performance, and director efficacy as a moderator strengthened this relationship. The result is consistent with the political economy theory that argues that an unstable political system and a weak judicial system will strongly affect investors and their rights. Practical implications: The impact of political influence on the corporate sector remains a concern for policymakers, regulators, investors, financial experts, auditors and academic researchers. This study's findings are that an effective board of directors can strengthen the company's best practices by controlling political connectedness to protect all the interested parties, particularly investors, and restore their confidence. Therefore, the results of this study can assist all stakeholders when a PCs exists to make the right decisions. Originality/value: The study extends the literature in terms of theoretical contribution that uses an integrative approach to combine political economy theory, agency theory and resource dependence theory to address the moderating role of director efficacy with an association between PCs and firm financial performance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no extant research has investigated the association between PCs and firm financial performance using five aspects of PCs, along with moderator director efficacy.

Research Question/Issue: Information processing, agency, and resource dependence perspectives provide diverging predictions regarding the relationship between board interlocks and firm performance, which are rooted in different perspectives on the roles of boards of directors. This study argues that these various approaches are reconcilable when considering the nature of board committees to which the interlocked directors are assigned. Research Findings/Insights: We test our hypotheses on a sample of 5133 firm-year observations in India. Our analyses support our hypotheses. The results show that interlocks between audit committees, whose primary function relates to providing financial oversight and ensuring compliance, are negatively related to firm performance. In contrast, interlocks between nomination and remuneration committees of Indian firms, which provide them with access to resources such as human capital and information on appropriate incentive structures, are positively related to performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study clarifies the relationship between board committee interlocks and firm performance by taking a multi-theoretical perspective. Our analysis suggests that information processing, agency, and resource dependence theories complement one another in explaining the effect of interlocks on firm performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results show that it is not board interlocks per se that are detrimental to firm performance; in fact, appointing well-connected directors with experience in serving on other boards might be beneficial for firms. However, firms should not assign specific monitoring-intensive tasks such as auditing to directors who also serve on other firms' audit committees. Our findings suggest that these directors should have greater independence and focus. (c) 2023 The Authors. Corporate Governance: An International Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

This study investigates the firms' CSR disclosure by considering the joint effects of board gender diversity and secrecy culture in an international setting. Building on a sample of 14,185 firm-year observations from 43 countries during 2010-2019, this study shows that while board gender diversity and CSR disclosure are positively associated, countries' secrecy levels negatively affect CSR disclosure. However, we provide evidence that the higher female representation on the board of directors significantly attenuates the restrictive role of secrecy culture on the CSR disclosure level. In other words, the suppressive effect of national secrecy on CSR disclosure weakens firms with higher gender diversity on the board of directors. Our results are robust to several sensitivity checks and endogeneity problems. This study suggests that the reducing effects of national secrecy culture on firms' CSR disclosure level can be attenuated by utilizing internal governance mechanisms such as board gender diversity.

Purpose: Are board ties among competitors harmful to customers? The prevalent assumption on board ties among competitors is that they harm customer benefits. This study examines the mechanism by which board ties with competitors result in an outcome conducive to customers. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 79 savings banks in South Korea, we investigate the extent of banks' board ties with other banks and their engagement in a project financing (PF) consortium from 2014 to 2020. The generalised least square was adopted to test the hypotheses. We also performed several supplemental analyses to further support our results. Findings/results: Savings banks with greater board ties with rivals provided more financial opportunities to their customers by forming PF consortia more actively with other banks. Furthermore, the positive impact of board ties on banks' participation in a PF consortium increases, especially when the proportion of external shareholders is smaller or when savings banks are family firms. Practical implications: Outside directors can not only play the role of monitoring the management but also serve as assistants who can help banks provide financial services (or products) that banks could not provide individually. Originality/value: While prior studies have clearly recognised the negative impacts on customers of board-friendship ties among rivals, little attention has been paid to the potential mechanism by which board ties among competing firms can benefit customers. This study challenges the dominant assumption by demonstrating that savings banks with greater board ties with other banks provide more financial opportunities to their economically weak customers. Contribution: Finally, this study contributes to the family business literature by providing insight into how the unique characteristics of family firms in strategic choices make outside directors contribute as assistants than supervisors.

In one of the most influential studies on family firm internationalization, Sciascia et al. (2012) advance a curvilinear relationship between family ownership and firm internationalization. We replicate their study adopting a three-step approach. First, we use the same measures on a different sample to test the generalizability of their findings. Second, we change the independent variable and hypothesize a negative relationship between family involvement in the board of directors and firm internationalization. Third, we introduce and measure the moderating role of firm age and firm size in this relationship. Our study advances the family firm internationalization literature both theoretically and methodologically. Theoretically, we show that it is not so much family ownership per se, but the influence the family obtains through board directorship that affects the family firm internationalization strategy. In addition, we show that this effect is moderated by firm age and size. Methodologically, our study is an important step forward toward increasingly transparent and replicable family business research. (c) 2023, The Author(s).

Purpose: This study aims to examine the link between boards and audit committees and firm performance in Kuwaiti listed firms in the context of recent and extensive corporate governance regulatory reform. Design/methodology/approach: Panel data regression analysis with fixed effects and clustered standard errors of firm performance for 61-97 listed industrial and services firms in Kuwait over a seven-year period. The dependent variables are the returns on assets and equity, the debt-to-equity ratio and leverage and Tobin's Q and the independent variables comprise board of directors and audit committee characteristics, including size, the number of meetings and the numbers of independent and outside board and expert committee members. Firm size, subsidiary status and cash flow serve as control variables. Findings: Mixed results with respect to the characteristics of the board of directors. Board size and independent and outsider board members positively relate only to Tobin's Q and insiders only to debt to equity. For audit committee characteristics, committee size, independence and expertise positively relate to the return on equity and committee size and expertise only to Tobin's Q. Of the five performance measures considered, board and audit committee characteristics together best determine Tobin's Q. Research limitations/implications: Data from a single country limits generalisability and control variables necessarily limited in a developing market context. Need for qualitative insights into corporate governance reform as a complement to conventional quantitative analysis. In combining accounting and market information, Tobin's Q appears best able to recognise the performance benefits of good corporate governance in terms of internal organisational change. Practical implications: The recent corporate governance code and guidelines reforms exert a mixed impact on firm performance, with audit committees, not boards, of most influence. But recent reforms implied most change to boards of directors. One suggestion is that non-market reform may have been unneeded given existing market pressure on listed firms and firms anticipating regulatory change. Social implications: Kuwait's corporate governance reforms codified corporate governance practices already in place among many of its firms in pursuit of organisational legitimacy, and while invoking substantial change to audit committees, involved minor change to firm performance, at least in the short term. Some firms may also have delisted in expectation of stronger corporate governance requirements. Regardless, these direct and indirect processes both improved the overall quality of listed firm corporate governance and performance in Kuwait. Originality/value: Seminal analysis of corporate governance reforms in Kuwait, which have rapidly progressed from no corporate governance code and guidelines to an initially voluntary and then compulsory regime. Only known analysis to incorporate both board of directors and audit committee characteristics. Reveals studies of the corporate governance-firm performance relationship may face difficulty in model specification, and empirical significance, given the complexity of corporate governance codes and guidelines, leads in changing firm behaviour and self-selection of firms into and out of regulated markets.

This research recognizes the increasing importance of the preservation of the natural environment for society as well as for the corporate sector. The study adopts a stakeholder-agency theory perspective to examine the influence of characteristics and effectiveness of the board of directors on the environmental disclosures made by the corporate sector. The method of content analysis was adopted for collecting information on board characteristics, board processes, and environmental disclosures made by the sample companies. The extent of environmental disclosure has been measured by using an Environmental Disclosures Index. It was found that a higher proportion of independent directors, the absence of chairman-CEO duality, and the overall board effectiveness had a significant positive influence on the extent of environmental disclosures. However, board diversity represented by female directors on the boards was found to have a statistically insignificant impact on environmental disclosures.

We expect board of director diversity to be reflected in the way directors carry out their monitoring and advisory roles, including succession planning, and to affect the governance of firms. We conceive that the behaviour of family firm boards is influenced by their demographic and cognitive diversity, which can in turn affect how directors perform their roles. We apply upper echelons theory (Hambrick and Mason, 1984) to six family business case studies to highlight how directors act as resource providers for their firms by utilising their personal experiences, judgement, external connections and access to information. We argue that there is a relationship between director diversity (demographic and cognitive), behaviour and roles, including those related to succession planning, that contributes to the ability of family businesses to survive and prosper.

This study examines the link between the political connections and financial performance of companies in Brazil and Canada, taking into account the moderating role of their country institutional factors. The authors use a comparative analysis of the largest listed companies in the two countries between 2010 and 2017 inclusive. There were four main results: (a) no significant difference was noted in the number of politically connected firms, although Brazilian companies were more politically connected on average than Canadian companies; a significant difference was noted between Brazil and Canada in terms of the number of politically connected directors and executive officers; (b) a significant and positive link emerged in both countries between political connections and firm performance, as measured by ROIC and ROA; (c) distinguishing between the political connections of directors and those of officers, a more significant positive association with performance was noticed in the latter; (d) most important, a clear and significant moderating role played by their country institutional factors was not apparent in the relationship between firms' political connections and performance. These latter results are mainly due to the lack of significant difference between the two countries in the number of politically connected firms. Contrary to expectations (and those of previous studies examining multicountry samples), the same effects from corporate political connections were shown in both countries. The study makes two important contributions. First, political connections seem to have become stronger than governance and institutional mechanisms, when it comes to controlling the behaviour of big corporations. Political connections have become so important that they influence the firm's management structure, whatever the institutional context; they seem to transcend governance mechanisms. Second, this study is among the first to demonstrate the need for investigating political connections at different firm levels; it shows the specific effect of political connections through executive officers rather than only through boards of directors, as is usually done.

This paper contributes empirically to the debate on who should nominate new directors: shareholders or the board? While nomination committees composed of incumbent board members are common around the world, the use of nomination committees composed of shareholders (SNBs) is recommended in several Nordic countries. We use the unique case of Finland as a quasi-experiment to examine the relation between the type of nomination procedure and board turnover. We find that firms with SNBs have boards with shorter average tenure, and fewer long-serving directors. We also find evidence suggesting a higher turnover performance sensitivity in the case of SNB firms: the average board tenure is more strongly related to firm performance in the case of SNB firms, and the relation between board tenure and the presence of experienced directors is more related to performance in SNB firms. In all, our results support the claim that SNBs might be useful tools to turn around board structures and tie individual director's performance to company performance.

In this study, I examine the role racial minorities in the boardroom can play in reducing social injustice by promoting more equal access to mortgage credit to minority households. I develop a simple theoretical model that posits directors who are racial minorities provide the credit unions they govern with a perspective that shapes lenders' trust of minority applicants. This trust is shaped by homophily and the tendency of individuals to prefer interactions with similar individuals. Using mortgage loan data from a cross-section of credit unions in the United States from 185,446 applications, I find that credit unions where the majority of board members are minorities are less likely to reject a similarly qualified minority applicant than their counterparts. Governance by minority directors significantly reduces the effects of discrimination faced by minority applicants. The board's effect is strongest in minority neighborhoods and where the homophily is stronger between directors and applicants. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

In many respects, Australian boards more closely approach normative "best practice" guidelines for corporate governance than boards in other Western countries. Do Australian firms then demonstrate a board demographic-organisational performance link that has not been found in other economies? We examine the relationships between board demographics and corporate performance in 348 of Australia's largest publicly listed companies and describe the attributes of these firms and their boards. We find that, after controlling for firm size, board size is positively correlated with firm value. We also find a positive relationship between the proportion of inside directors and the market-based measure of firm performance. We discuss the implications of these findings and compare our findings to prevailing research in the US and the UK.

The control role of the Board of Directors is aimed at monitoring the decisions and actions undertaken by managers in order to protect stockholders' interests. Considerable theoretical and empirical research has analyzed whether directors' behavior is consistent with their fiduciary responsibility, but this research has reported inconsistent findings. This paper offers a comprehensive review of both theoretical and empirical literature on the control role of the board and suggests several guidelines for future research. (c) 2003 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

Boards of directors are governance bodies that serve important functions for organizations, ranging from monitoring management on behalf of different shareholders to providing resources. Board roles and characteristics vary widely among national cultures and, within each country, among different company types. Despite such variety, research on family business boards has been dominated by prescriptions and by the lack of an explicit recognition of family firm types characterized by different governance requirements. We argue that a contingency approach to defining board structure, activity, and roles offers useful guidance in understanding board contributions to family business performance. We develop a theory to show how board characteristics are a reflection of a family firm's power, experience, and culture makeup. This theory provides insight into descriptions of existing board choices and prescriptions for family firms interested in starting or adapting their board of directors. (c) 2004, SAGE Publications.

The role of the board of directors in firm strategy has long been the subject of debate. However, research efforts have suffered from several deficiencies: the lack of an overarching theoretical perspective, reliance on proxies for the strategy role rather than a direct measure of it and the lack of quantitative data linking this role to firm financial performance. We propose a new theoretical perspective to explain the board's role in strategy, integrating organisational control and agency theories. We categorise a board's approach to strategy according to two constructs: strategic control and financial control. The extent to which either construct is favoured depends on contextual factors such as board power, environmental uncertainty and information asymmetry.

This paper advances the resource dependence and social networks literature by investigating a board's structural social capital created as a consequence of interlocking directorates. Using approaches and measures developed by social network analysis we compare the interpersonal directorship networks of the top 250 companies in the United States and Australia. We find that the smaller, sparser Australian network is only marginally less compact and connected than the larger US network at the firm level of analysis. However, at the director level of analysis the US network is much larger and more connected than its Australian counterpart. As a result, we argue that scholars studying the resource dependence role of boards should consider using measures of interpersonal links as well as traditional measures of inter-firm links. Understanding how boards impact on corporate performance is a question central to the corporate governance research agenda. Agency theory, for example, argues that the key way a board adds value is by ensuring the interests of the managers of the firm are aligned with the interests of the owners (Eisenhardt 1989; Jensen & Meckling 1976). A quite distinct area of inquiry, however, relates to the role that the board plays in providing access to important resources such as customers (Pennings 1980), capital (Mizruchi & Stearns 1988), the business elite (Uscem 1984) and power in general (Pfeffer & Salancik 1978). We aim to broaden understanding of the resource dependence theory of corporate governance by examining the links provided to a board by interlocking directorships. We commence by reviewing existing research on the resource dependence role of the board before outlining how the emerging construct of social capital can be adapted and applied to investigate this role. In particular, we highlight how it is the personal director network that is critical to the development of social capital rather than the corporate network (i.e. network of corporations). While this study is primarily exploratory and descriptive, we contribute to the literature by employing a new methodology to measure the 'opportunity network' that interlocking directorates provide a board within a national corporate governance system (Adams 2002a; 2002b; 2002c). We show how the formal models, procedures and techniques developed in social network analysis can be applied to individual-level networks among directors. We stress that we are not considering the formation of social capital at the individual level; rather we are examining the systemic connections of individual directors in order to illustrate the opportunity network available to a board within the national corporate governance system. A comparison of the Australian and US systems highlights the divergence in network attributes between corporate networks and the networks of interlocking directors. We conclude with implications and areas for further research.

This paper examines board effectiveness through an examination of the work and relationships of non-executive directors. It is based on 40 in-depth interviews with company directors, commissioned for the Higgs Review. The paper observes that research on corporate governance lacks understanding of the behavioural processes and effects of boards of directors. Whilst board structure, composition and independence condition board effectiveness it is the actual conduct of the non-executive vis-a-vis the executive that determines board effectiveness. Data about behaviour and relationships on boards suggest that traditional theoretical divisions between agency and stewardship theory, and control versus collaboration models of the board do not adequately reflect the lived experience of non-executive directors and other directors on the board. Developing accountability as a central concept in the explanation of how boards operate effectively enables the paper to both challenge the dominant grip of agency theory on governance research and support the search for theoretical pluralism and greater understanding of board processes and dynamics. Practically, the work suggests that corporate governance reform will be undermined by prescription that supports distant perceptions of board effectiveness but not the actual effectiveness of boards.

We test the effects of stakeholder management on CEOs' salaries, bonuses, stock options, and total compensation. We also examine the extent to which the interaction of stakeholder management and financial performance determines compensation. Using a longitudinal database of 406 Fortune 1000 firms, our results suggest that stakeholder management is relevant to boards of directors when setting CEO compensation. Specifically, we found a significant, negative main effect of stakeholder management on CEO salaries. Further, we found that stakeholder management typically reduces the rewards CEOs may get for increasing levels of financial performance. In tandem, these results indicate that CEOs may jeopardize their personal wealth by pursuing stakeholder-related initiatives. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A post-Enron consensus on corporate governance has emerged among investor groups, government regulators, and the private exchanges. The corporate board should function principally as a shareholder oversight body. To ensure independence from management, the board should have a substantial majority of independent, outside directors, who neither have business relationships with the firm nor social relationships with management. These reforms may decrease the probability for director complicity in managerial malfeasance. However, research has not demonstrated a relationship between board independence and firm performance. Corporate governance looks quite different when the firm is considered as a cooperative team to produce new wealth. From this "production" perspective, corporate governance recommendations differ substantially from recent reforms. Rather than have directors solely represent shareholder interests, boards should represent those stakeholders that add value, assume unique risk, and possess strategic information. Rather than restrict insiders to one or two, boards should include a group of employees (managers and workers,) who bring the firm's know-how to the table. The team production model for corporate governance has far-reaching implications. The recommendations derived from our model suggest that the latest reform proposals offered by the New York Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission create a board of directors that does not adequately consider the firm's new wealth-producing capabilities. This, we argue, accounts for the missing positive link between board independence and firm performance. (c) Academy of Management Executive.

Good governance for SMEs is critical for economic development and growth in both developed and developing economies. In this paper we focus on boards and governance in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) by investigating the role and contribution of "outside" directors in this setting. By contrasting board role theories against different types of SMEs, firms are expected to recruit "outside" board members for various reasons. Illustrated by 52 empirical studies of "outside" directors in SMEs we show how agency theory, resource based view of the firm, and resource dependence theory can be applied to understand the multiple roles that "outside" directors can play in family firms, venture capital-backed firms and other SMEs. The illustration shows that the concept "outside" director is not the same in different theories and in different empirical settings. Based on this finding, we argue for the need to have a conscious and balanced use of theories for understanding the role and contribution of "outside" directors in SMEs.

Affirmative action and diversity continue to be contentious issues in the United States. Financial markets are still reeling from the effects of Enron, WorldCom and other corporate exemplars of corruption and malfeasance. The role of the board of directors in these scandals is the subject of serious and ongoing concern. Weak and/or ineffectual boards are often the consequences of "old-boy networks" and a lack of diversity in membership. This research study argues for an increased presence of gender and race diversity on boards of directors. Empirical evidence is presented that shows a significant increase in the presence of ethnic minorities and females when pictures of board members are included in annual reports. We suggest that requiring pictures of board members in annual reports and regulatory filings would result in a larger presence for gender and race diversity on boards of directors. This requirement is not a significant burden and merely represents compliance with the spirit and intent of the "full disclosure" principle. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Crises in corporate accountability have prompted calls for boards of directors to monitor (i.e., oversee) top management teams (TMTs) more closely and become more involved in strategic decision making. Research on board processes has focused largely on the benefits of these board behaviors, with little attention paid to possible negative consequences. This study addresses that gap by examining the impact of board monitoring and involvement on affective conflict within the top management team. We find that board montoring and involvement interact with TMT power such that more powerful teams suffer less affective conflict when the board monitors their activities, but greater affective conflict when the board becomes involved in the firm's strategic decision-making process.

This study examined the relationship between top management team (TMT) tenure and certain types of illegal activity within manufacturing and retail firms, and the moderating influence of board size on this relationship. Using a sample of 221 Fortune 500 firms for the 1998-2002 time period, the results support a positive link between long TMT tenure and the incidence of "serious," "willful," and "repeat" OSHA and EPA violations occurring within the sample firms. Further, the results suggest that the number of illegal violations is significantly reduced among those firms having larger boards of directors. Thus, the results offer support for the notion that larger boards may be more effective than smaller boards in carrying out the management oversight function.

This study, based on a comparison of the Combined Code Guidelines for non-executive directors between listed and unlisted boards, suggests that on unlisted boards non-executive directors have a greater degree of involvement in strategic development, financial monitoring, shareholder communication and overall board contribution than on listed boards, but a lesser degree of involvement in the monitoring of management, the setting of executive remuneration, the appointment and removal of executives, and succession planning. The importance of risk analysis and induction is considered high across both sectors, although board development and independence is considered less important on unlisted boards.

Traditionally, corporate governance has focused on the problem of crafting mechanisms to align the interests of owners and managers. The key characteristic has been to minimize the potential for managers to act in their own self-interest at the expense of shareholders. The purpose of this paper is to focus on employees as stakeholders in the governance process. We argue that creating an environment where employees have help in behaving ethically, in the course of their work, is the first step in encouraging them to voice observations of wrongdoing. Seven groups of professionals in the accounting and insurance fields were surveyed during a 10-year period and asked to indicate the extent to which 14 items were helpful in dealing with ethical challenges. Over 2700 responses were analyzed. The findings indicate that professionals think that their organizational culture and policy for voice was more helpful in dealing with ethical dilemmas than was their professional association.

This paper first describes the complex Dutch corporate governance system and the functioning of the Supervisory Board under the rules of the structure regime and co-option model up to the present time. The critiques of the parties and stakeholders involved in this model are investigated next, followed by a description and explanation of the recent developments of the Dutch model and a discussion of the pros and cons of the alternatives with regard to the interests of the various stakeholders. Finally, some key factors for improving the boards' functioning in the - changing - Dutch corporate governance system are presented. The findings and recommendations are based on case-studies and interviews conducted in large Dutch companies over several years and on extensive analyses of documents and recent evolutions. This research method however, is only suitable for a process of exploration, clarification and development of hypotheses.

The extant literature on CEO succession has paid significant attention to the organizational outcomes of CEO successions such as strategic change and firm performance. Few studies, however, have explicitly examined the personal outcomes of the newly selected CEOs. In this study, we examined how successions contexts may influence the likelihood that a new CEO is dismissed within three years after succession, namely, "new CEO dismissal." Based upon agency theory and human capital theory, we argue that new CEO dismissal may represent a correction to an inappropriate CEO selection and accordingly, succession contexts that tend to lead to an inappropriate CEO selection will increase the likelihood of new CEO dismissal. With a sample of 204 CEO successions in the time period of 1993-1998, we find that the origin of the new CEO and the characteristics of the board of directors at the succession time have significant impact on the likelihood of new CEO dismissal.

This paper examines why firms differ in levels of R&D investment intensity by developing and testing a theory of direct and interaction effects of top management team and board outsider composition on R&D intensity. The theory is tested in a longitudinal sample of technology-intensive firms that completed an initial public offering. The results indicate that both top management team composition and board composition have direct and additive effects on R&D investment intensity. Also, monitoring by outsider directors does not constitute a universally effective governance mechanism with regard to a firm's R&D investment strategy. Firms opt for lower levels of R&D investment intensity when their outsider-rich board interacts with a team of managers who have high levels of (1) firm tenure, (2) shared team-specific experience, or (3) functional heterogeneity. When a firm's competitiveness relies on sustained R&D investments, it is important to note these interaction effects and make adjustments to promote a healthy dialogue between managers and the board. Adjustments could be made to the management team composition (e.g., initiating management turnover to reduce firm tenure) or to the bundle of governance mechanisms (e.g., partially substituting board monitoring with other mechanisms).

Purpose - The objective of this article is to examine and conceptualise gender-related boardroom dynamics that affect how women can make contributions on corporate boards. Design/methodology/approach - Stories were collected from eight women directors about their experiences from more than 100 corporate boards. Narrative methods were used in the data analysis. Findings - Women as well as men need to understand the power game inside and outside the boardroom. Their contribution depends on the ability and willingness to make alliances with the most influential actors, to spend time on preparations, being present on the most important decision-making arenas, and to take leadership roles. Practical implications - The study has implications for theory as well as practice. Process-oriented theories should be included in studies of boards and governance, and the study showed that boardroom dynamics are not neutral to gender. Concepts and relationships are suggested that should be included in further theory development. The study has also given several practical examples and suggestions on how women can make contributions on corporate boards. Originality/value - The study has value for developing the role of women directors. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The board of directors is regarded as one of the most imperative governance mechanisms in small and medium-sized family firms. Empirical studies examining both the roles these boards fulfil in a family business context, as well as evaluating the CEO's perceived importance of these roles, are scarce. Founded by a range of conceptual and multi-theoretical board role definitions, this paper contributes to the literature by empirically determining board roles. Furthermore, the importance of these board roles and differences between the board's performance and perceived importance are assessed. The results show it is indispensable to differentiate between two aggregated roles that boards in small and medium-sized family firms perform: control and service. The control role is predominantly based on agency theory, whereas the service role includes multiple theoretical perspectives. The CEOs of the family firms perceive the service role of the board as most important. However, in order to direct succession and to compensate for the owner/manager's altruistic behaviour, the board's control role should not be neglected. The acknowledgement of these two aggregated board roles and their importance may enhance future research on board roles within specific contexts. (c) 2006 Blaekwell Publishing Ltd.

Governance reform of publicly held corporations is an important topic these days, but a critical subtext has been missing from this often searing debate. Namely, what is the significance of these governance reforms, de jure and de facto, for the publicly held corporation's distant, smaller, but economically robust brethren - namely, the closely held, family-owned business? Should these family-owned entities be held to the same governance guidelines and standards that apply to those firms making up the ranks of the Fortune 500, for example? To put it another way, does one size fit all? We caution that many of the most popularized corporate governance practices may be detrimental to family businesses. Many of these recommendations may harm family unity or might be too complex for private firms, and many are applicable only to very large, public companies with dispersed ownership. Popular corporate governance practices are focused toward a market model of corporate governance, found prevalently in the United States and United Kingdom, which involves companies with a widely dispersed shareholder base and a majority of independent, outside board members. In contrast, the typical family-owned business exhibits characteristics of the control model of corporate governance, found prevalently in continental Europe, Latin America, and Asia, which involves companies with a concentrated shareholder base and family member "insiders" active in management and the board. As a result of these differences, many of the new laws and recommendations may actually be harmful to family-owned businesses. (c) 2006 Family Firm Institute, Inc.

How many directorships are too many? Globally, normative advice emphasises the importance of limiting the number of directorships any individual should hold due to the workloads they entail. However, there is little empirical evidence to support this view. Rather, there is a strong tradition of supporting multiple directorships as a mechanism for the firm to co-opt external resources. To explore the issue of director workloads and multiple directorships, we first consider the issues related to multiple directorships and outline the conclusions of extant international and Australian studies into multiple directorships. We then detail our objectives in undertaking this research and our approach to data collection. Our findings indicate that the incidence of multiple directorships in Australian listed companies is low. We also find that many of the apparent examples of multiple directorships are due to related entities, which share common directors and, due to the nature of these entities, have much lower workload requirements. Further, there does not appear to be any relationship between holding multiple directorships and firm financial performance. Finally, we discuss the implications for boards and those interested in governance, particularly the need to ensure governance recommendations and guidelines reflect empirical findings. We offer one solution to address the concerns of boards, investors, other stakeholders and the community regarding multiple directorships: board and individual director evaluations.

This study examines relationships between the existence of boards of directors and advisory boards and the use of planning in family businesses. It is argued that both of the primary roles of boards, the governance of a firm's management team for the firm's stakeholders and the provision of valuable business resources to the firm's management team, are significantly related to the use of planning activities in family businesses. The empirical evidence, drawn from a survey of more than 130 family businesses, largely supports the hypotheses. Conclusions and suggestions for future research close the article.

Over the last few years corporate governance codes and shareholder expectations have increased the need for boards of directors to demonstrate effective leadership, quality decision-making processes and the ability to exercise corporate controls. Shareholders and stakeholders continue to focus on indicators such board structure, composition and nonexecutive independence as proxies for effectiveness, often without an increased understanding of the environment in which boards of directors make decisions, or the behaviour and dynamics of individuals. In order specifically to address this issue the Combined Code, published in 2003, stated that a board should undertake annually "a formal and rigorous evaluation of its own performance, that of the committees and individual directors" (Financial Reporting Council, 2003, p. 10. The Combined Code on Corporate Governance. London: Financial Reporting Council), although it omitted to give formal guidance on evaluation methods, or the disclosure of outcomes to shareholders. This paper draws on earlier research (Long, 2004) in order to contribute to an improved understanding of the role and effectiveness of board evaluation, and to add to the policy debate by identifying board dynamics which influence the environment in which boards operate. It suggests that the evaluation process should interpret specific influences on the environment in which boards make their decisions - company lifecycle, corporate structure, board culture and embedded process - highlighting distinct board roles and responsibilities, and diverse levels of individual approach, expectation and contribution. The author draws on her work through Boardroom Review to explore ways in which board evaluation can achieve a range of corporate objectives which extend beyond compliance, and encourages boards and their chairmen to adopt a thoughtful and thorough approach to this year's evaluation model.

This study examined relationships between the number of female board members, board tenure, and board size on the number of 10K investigations that were instigated against firms in the basic materials and financial services sectors of the economy. After controlling for the effects of firm size, we found evidence of an interaction effect between the number of female directors and average board tenure for firms in the financial services sector, such that a higher number of women on boards coupled with longer average board tenure results in higher firm social performance (i.e., the fewer the number of 10K investigations brought against the firm). No link was found between female directors and average board tenure for the basic materials firms. Further, no interactive patterns were observed between female directors and board size in either sector. Our findings suggest that future board research may benefit from a "contingency approach, " as this study has provided some evidence that the relationships between board characteristics and firm performance may not be generalizable from one sector to another. Future research should carefully consider how the sector or industry may affect the impact of board characteristics on firm performance.

This study aims to investigate the moderating effect of the board chair's role on the relationship between board human capital and firm performance. Board human capital has been regarded as a valuable asset that enhances firm performance. Especially, the board chair plays a crucial role in developing this high-echelon human capital. This study utilises a set of longitudinal data to examine 275 firms in Taiwan. The result indicates that board human capital is positively related to firm performance, and the individual human capital of the board chair represents a moderating effect on the relationship between board human capital and performance.

Despite a large body of research in the management, accounting, economics, and finance literatures, the relationship between board composition and firm performance is still controversial and ripe for debate (for a recent study, see Boone et al., 2004). Utilizing the theoretical approach of Zahra and Pearce (1989) that identifies the three key roles of the board as oversight, strategy, and service, we examine the effects of having board interlocks between an industrial firm and of financial services firm, and firm characteristics. Using publicly available data on all listed Italian firms for the year 2001, we find that for industrial firms, there is a positive relationship between the number of board interlocks with a bank and current year return on assets, however, the opposite is true for financial services firms. Finally, we find no relationship between interlocking directorates with banks and firm capital structure.

Women are increasing in number among corporations' boards of directors, yet their representation is far from uniform across firms. In this study, we adopted a resource dependence theory lens to identify organizational predictors of women on boards. We tested our hypotheses using panel data from the 1,000 U.S. firms that were largest in terms of sales between 1990 and 2003. We found that organizational size, industry type, firm diversification strategy, and network effects (linkages to other boards with women directors) significantly impact the likelihood of female representation on boards of directors.

The board of directors is one of a number of internal governance mechanisms that are intended to ensure that the interests of shareholders and managers are closely aligned, and to discipline or remove ineffective management teams. Among the most significant governance issues currently faced by the modern corporation are those relating to diversity, such as gender and age, and independence of directors. While board diversity and independence has been a growing area of research in recent years, most empirical research on this topic has been restricted to US data. The generalisability of such findings may not extend across national boundaries due to different regulatory and economic environments, cultural differences, the size of capital markets and the effectiveness of governance mechanisms. Consequently, the importance and value of various governance structures, including board diversity and independence, should be separately examined in each country, and the influential factors investigated. This study reports on the diversity and independence of the board membership of 100 top Australian companies in 2003. Australia has one of the most developed stock markets in the Asia-Pacific region. With the collapse of several well-known public companies such as Ansett, OneTel and HIH, there is an increasing demand to evaluate the corporate governance practices of Australian companies, including the composition of boards. Accordingly, this research provides a timely review of the state of corporate governance in Australia so far as board composition is concerned. (c) 2007 The Authors.

We examine hypothesised links between the board of directors and firm performance as predicted by the three predominant theories in corporate governance research, namely agency theory, stewardship theory and resource dependence theory. By employing a pattern matching analysis of seven cases, we are able to examine the hypothesised link between board demography and firm performance expected under each theory. We find that while each theory can explain a particular case, no single theory explains the general pattern of results. We conclude by endorsing recent calls for a more process-orientated approach to both theory and empirical analysis if we are to understand how boards add value. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This study examines the presence and roles of female directors of U.S. Fortune 500 firms, focusing on committee assignments and director background. Prior work from almost two decades ago concludes that there is a systematic bias against females in assignment to top board committees. Examining a recent data set with a logistic regression model that controls for director and firm characteristics, director resource-dependence roles and interaction between director gender and director characteristics, we find that female directors are less likely than male directors to sit on executive committees and more likely than male directors to sit on public affairs committees. There is little if any evidence of systematic gender bias in director assignment to other board committees. We find some evidence that boards evaluate resource dependence differently for women than men. (c) Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.

Prior studies of the relationship between the composition of boards of directors and firm performance offer equivocal results. Drawing on agency and power circulation theories, we attempt to reduce this equivocality by asserting that CEO power moderates the relationship. Specifically, an outside director dominated board is needed to check a powerful CEO, but monitoring by other executives provides sufficient constraints on CEOs with low power. We used event study methodology to test the effects of the interaction between board composition and CEO power on stock market reaction to 73 unexpected CEO deaths. We found support for our theorizing among two of three sources of CEO power. Thus, although regulatory trends increasingly support outside director dominated boards, our findings indicate that this may not always benefit shareholders and that CEO power should be considered when constructing boards.

In this paper we analyse boards of directors as workgroups, i.e. groups of people that perform one or more tasks within an organisational context. Building on previous studies, we developed a model that relates group's social-psychological processes to three different board tasks: service, monitoring and networking. We tested our model through a survey on 301 large manufacturing firms in Italy. Our findings support the idea that (a) process variables and, to a limited extent, demographic variables significantly influence board task performance; (b) board processes have a different impact on each specific board task; (c) board task performance varies depending upon firm and industry characteristics.

This paper examines the relationship between firm complexity and board of director composition. Utilising the board typology of Baysinger and Zardkoohi (1986), we classify board members either as insiders, business experts, support specialists, or community influentials, and examine board composition in relation to firm internal and external complexity. Internal complexity refers to the sophistication of internal work processes (proxied by firm R&D expenditures, and the amount of invested capital), while external complexity relates to the external competitive structure (proxied by the number of business and geographic segments, and industrial leadership). Utilising a random sample of 150 firms drawn from six industries over the 2003-2005 time period, and after classifying 4,408 directors to one of our board categories, multivariate results confirm conjectures that complexity is related to the specific capabilities that each board member brings to the firm. We find that externally complex firms substitute community influentials for insiders. Additionally, internally complex firms have lower levels of community influentials, which are substituted by insiders and support specialists. This study adds to a small but growing literature that examines the economic determinants of board structure (Boone et al., 2007; Coles et al., 2005; Gillan et al., 2003; Linck et al., 2005), by providing a unique lens in examining board characteristics that goes beyond the traditional insider/independent classification.

In this article we examine what affects the board of directors' involvement in the advice to management, with emphasis on the influence of crises on the board advisory tasks performance. Based on a survey of 881 small Norwegian firms, we analyse responses from CEOs in order to determine whether and to what extent the board is actively involved in the governance process during crises through providing advice. The study has two major contributions to board research in general and research of into small firms in particular. The first is the go beyond the "usual suspects" of board size, CEO duality, and board independence when looking for determinants of board involvement in advice. The second contribution is a clearer understanding of board involvement during crises. Our results show that board member diversity becomes particularly important during crises, since this provides the CEO and firm access to a more diverse pool of competences and experiences. We also find that crises moderate the effects of incentive on the board's involvement in advice. This evidence sheds new light on the determinants of directors' involvement in board tasks, suggesting that directors' incentive to perform certain board tasks vary according to the contingent situation the firm is experiencing.

Purpose - This paper proposes mainly that boards of directors (BOD) are teams that share characteristics with many other kinds of teams. As a consequence, some of the factors that lead to board effectiveness are the same factors that lead to team effectiveness in general. By integrating the organizational behaviour literature on teams with the governance literature, a comprehensive model of BOD performance is proposed. Design/methodology/approach - This conceptual paper proposes a model to assess the performance of a board and situates board performance as one input into firm performance. Findings - This paper outlines the dynamic interplay between board characteristics, functionality and performance and proposes a comprehensive model, based largely on the group dynamics literature. Research limitations/implications - Suggests that future research attempt to empirically address some (or all) of the items in the conceptual model. Acknowledges that operationalizing certain variables will prove challenging, but suggests that ethnographic accounts of how these variables (and potentially others) interact may be a valuable first step in more fully understanding board composition, functioning and performance. Practical implications - It is argued that by extending traditional passive agency roles, BOD may be able to provide a wider range of contributions to enhance shareholder value. Originality/value - This interdisciplinary paper integrates the group dynamics literature with the governance literature to propose a comprehensive model of BOD performance.

This study examines participation of African-Americans on the boards and board committees of the US Fortune 500. Prior work suggests the use of committee assignment to discern active versus figurehead involvement on boards. We use a logistic regression model that controls for director traits, firm characteristics and director resource-dependence roles to compare the odds that a black director will be assigned to key committees to those for a white director. We find that black directors are more (less) likely than whites to sit on audit and public affairs (executive) committees. Black female directors are more likely than both white females and black males to serve on finance committees. Thus there is some evidence that race plays a role in determining assignment to corporate board committees. (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Numerous studies have examined the effects of diversity on team performance under a variety of circumstances, but little attention has been directed to the national composition or the international qualifications of top management teams. The results of three exploratory studies of the extent of internationalisation among boards of directors and executives from samples of the largest multinational corporations (MNCs) based in the United States, Europe, and Asia are presented. The findings clearly show that European MNCs have a greater proportion of internationally qualified personnel on both their boards of directors and within the executive ranks than do USA-based companies. In both the USA and European samples, executives were more likely to have international qualifications than directors, while data from the Asian sample suggest that directors might be more likely to have international qualifications.

Increased engagement by investors with the companies in which they invest has been a major change in Western economies since the 1980s. Shareholder value provides rationale and incentive for investor engagement. The book summarizes the basic principles of shareholder value, and explains the reasons for its growth, especially in the UK and the USA. The authors outline a spectrum of investor engagement ranging from indirect/laissez-faire influence via (threat of) exit to direct intervention in specific areas of management practice. The book focuses on two types of investor, institutional investors and private equity/venture capital investors. Different types of institutional investors have different incentives for engagement, and adopt different methods. 'Universal investors' with long time horizons, such as pension funds, have especially strong incentives for engagement, as illustrated by USS Limited. The book distinguishes between institutional investors' routine and extraordinary engagement, and shows how collaboration amongst investors through organizations such as the Institutional Shareholders' Committee offsets the high costs of monitoring and provides means for ensuring compliance with best City practice'. The engagement of private equity funds is illustrated through case studies of equity funds and the portfolio firms in which they invested. But corporate managers are not simply passive reactors to investors' interventions: managers seek to influence investors, for example through managing market expectations. Shareholder value conceptions are not universal: they are strong in the UK and the USA, but are weaker in coordinated market economies such as Germany. The book concludes by evaluating the normative case for shareholder value and investor engagement, arguing that conventional analyses overestimate the efficiency arguments for shareholder value and the equity arguments against shareholder value. The future development of corporate governance is seen to require greater openness and the inclusion of a wider range of interests, not the further enhancement of the protection accorded to shareholder interests.

A growing body of ethics research investigates gender diversity and governance on corporate boards, at individual and firm levels, in single country studies. In this study, we explore the environmental context of female representation on corporate boards of directors, using data from 43 countries. We suggest that women's representation on corporate boards may be shaped by the larger environment, including the social, political and economic structures of individual countries. We use logit regression to conduct our analysis. Our results indicate that countries with higher representation of women on boards are more likely to have women in senior management and more equal ratios of male to female pay. However, we find that countries with a longer tradition of women's political representation are less likely to have high levels of female board representation.

This article contributes to the literature on board effectiveness by being perhaps the first to systematically examine how the nature of outside directors' prior experience, and resulting expertise, will influence the performance of a focal firm's strategic initiatives. Our theoretical model is grounded in the psychological literature on expertise and its role in group decision making effectiveness. We focus on outside director expertise in acquisition decision making, and its implications for the performance of the acquisitions of a focal firm. Our conceptual framework indicates that directors will develop expertise in making particular kinds of acquisition decisions (e.g., related or unrelated acquisitions or acquisitions in specific industries or product markets) through their past experiences at other firms with decisions about those specific types of acquisitions, and we predict that this experience and expertise will have positive effects on the performance of a focal firm's acquisitions. We extend our theoretical model to consider the conditions under which relevant director experience will prove most beneficial. Our model predicts that outside director acquisition expertise will deliver the greatest benefits when the focal firm's board is independent from management. We find empirical support for all of our hypotheses. In considering how and when director experience and resulting expertise may influence the performance of corporate acquisitions, our theory and results help to highlight a potential second main focus for research on the long-standing question of what factors render boards of directors effective.

This study makes a contribution to the growing literature on the board's resource provision role by examining a specific type of resource provision (i.e., industry experience supplementing) and demonstrating the criticality of the liabilities of newness to this particular role. In this study, we find that among younger entrepreneurial firms, a dearth of top management industry experience is offset by the presence of outside directors with significant managerial industry experience, providing evidence of experience supplementing by outside directors. Our study highlights that the notion of experience supplementing at the upper echelons prevails in young firms as they try to alleviate the burdens of the liability of newness. Experience supplementing underscores board-management collaboration during early years of firm development. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Using a sample of 714 private family influenced businesses in Germany, we investigate the relationship of goal alignment between owners and managers and the existence of a board of directors. Agency theory and stewardship theory serve as theoretical bases for our study. We find that firms with relatively high levels of goal alignment are less likely to have a board of directors. Our results provide support for the substitution hypothesis of formal by social control mechanisms. Furthermore, the findings show that firms without a board and with relatively low levels of goal alignment have less family members in the top management team. This circumstance might in turn be a trigger for owners to install a board. (c) 2008 International Council for Small Business.

Purpose - This paper seeks to examine the current debate regarding the role of a board director. Design/methodology/approach - A comprehensive review of the corporate governance (CG) literature is undertaken, with a particular focus on director contribution to board effectiveness. Findings - The literature review revealed a number of issues in the CG literature that highlight the need to clarify board director role and pay closer attention to the processes needed for directors to perform their role effectively. These issues have broadly been classified into: conceptual issues regarding board effectiveness and director contribution; a methodological issue of level of analysis (board as a group and a director as individual); failure of much of the literature to account for the external context in which the board directors operate; and prescriptive nature of the literature. Originality/value - Issues pertinent to the CG literature identified in this paper hold theoretical and practical implications.

Corporate governance regulations across the globe increasingly push for a model in which top management is supervised by an independent, vigilant and skilled board of directors. Academic research, however, produces ambiguous results as to the direct effects of such board characteristics on firm performance. We therefore analyze the relationships between board attributes, board working processes and board role performance through intermediate relationships. Several hypotheses are derived and tested by analyzing data obtained from a survey at the board level in The Netherlands. Our results partly confirm the relevance of the model of board processes related to board role performance, as suggested by [Forbes, D.P., and Milliken, F.J. (1999) Cognition and corporate governance: Understanding boards of directors as strategic decision-making groups. Academy of Management Review, 24, 489-505]. Particularly, this study exemplifies the relevance of different board processes for explaining board role performance. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is considered by many to have made the most sweeping changes affecting corporate governance since the Securities and Exchange Acts of 1933 and 1934. About 4 years after its passing, however, many governance experts question whether the time and expense of compliance engender any real reforms. This article examines whether corporations have restructured their boards in response to the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley and finds evidence that companies are implementing changes that should strengthen the monitoring ability of their boards.

We examine the impact of boards of directors on shareholder returns arising from acquisition announcements in the context of varying CEO ownership levels. Agency theory emphasizes the benefits of incentives pertaining to top managers and directors, whereas resource dependence theory focuses on directors' resource provision, advice and counsel. Drawing on both these perspectives, the authors describe effective boards as those that are vigilant (via incentives to monitor) and rich in human capital (via relevant experience). Such boards are able not only to monitor in the decision control sense, but also to provide strategic benefits to a greater degree than typical outside directors. The authors contend and find that moderate levels of CEO ownership, combined with appropriate incentives and human capital, increase returns to shareholders of acquiring firms. Although shareholders benefit less when CEO ownership is negligible or substantial, their welfare is still enhanced to the degree that the board has appropriate incentives and human capital.

Director compensation can potentially represent an ethical minefield. When faced with supporting strategic decisions that can lead to an increase in director pay, directors may consider their own interests and not solely those of the shareholders to whom they are legally bound to represent. In such cases, directors essentially become agents, rather than those installed to protect principals (shareholders) from agents. Using acquisitions as a study context, we employ a matched-pair design and find a statistically significant difference in outside director compensation between acquiring and control firms. Outside directors of acquiring firms earn more than twice as much as their counterparts in the matched-sample. (c) 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

This study examined the human and social capital factors associated with higher post-succession firm performance in family enterprises in Singapore. We also investigated the moderating influence of the board of directors in terms of its service role as stewards of the enterprise. We found that a successor's industry experience and diversity of network ties were positively associated with firm performance and boards that focused their role as advisors to the successor enhanced post-succession firm performance.

Purpose - Although board expertise has been identified as an important determinant of board performance, some surveys are still reporting that the overall level of board expertise is insufficient to carry out current and emerging roles. Consequently, companies must ensure that board members have the required skills and knowledge. This study aims to examine three board processes aimed at developing and improving board expertise. Design/methodology/approach - Based on disclosures in the corporate governance guidelines of 100 leading US companies, the study focuses on three board processes, i.e. director nominations, orientation and education programs, and board performance evaluations. Findings - Based on the initial findings, it is found that most companies in the sample were in compliance with stock exchange requirements and provided information on director nominations, orientation and education programs and board performance evaluations. All too often, however, the companies disclosed generic, non-specific information; this provides little reassurance that the proper processes are in place to promote companies' long-term interests. Research limitations/implications - By examining these key board processes, the paper contributes to the governance literature by providing empirical evidence on this important topic and offering guidance to companies examining board processes aimed at improving directors' overall expertise. Originality/value - By focusing on disclosures in corporate governance guidelines, the authors also gain insight into decisions made by companies under increased pressure from securities regulators and other stakeholders to provide increased transparency on governance issues.

This paper aims to critique moral stakeholder theory (MST) and to contrast it to earlier strategic stakeholder approach (SSA). Interview data were gathered from top executives at 12 companies in the energy sector in Canada and an in-depth literature review was conducted on MST and SSA. "Value" for shareholder and stakeholder may not be mutually exclusive in some instances. MST may hold the key to giving the board a more useful, comprehensive framework of the firm's utility and purpose to society. Organizations may be selected on their ethical performance by investors. Depending on whether ethical criteria are included in the definition of "firm's value", decisions about which stakeholder theory to use become an issue of strategic importance to all organizations. The paper illustrates how the board of directors as the governing body of the organisation may find that continuous assessment of the company's stakeholders is valuable in reducing risks.

In this paper we investigate three corporate governance issues in 30 Italian family firms: (i) the orientation either to the Agency Theory or to the Stewardship Theory; (ii) the board of directors' composition; (iii) the ability to involve nonfamily individuals in the company's management and governance (Openness Index) and the decision-making quality (Extension Index) and we analyze empirical results through a cluster analysis by following the Gubitta and Gianecchini's approach (2002). Our conclusion suggests that (i) small Italian family firms' corporate governance systems seem to be consistent with the guidelines suggested by the Stewardship Theory and (ii) Italian family firms' boards are characterized by a relevant presence of family members.

Managers have a unique fiduciary responsibility to shareholders of a firm that implies a set of ethical obligations. At a minimum, managers are required to protect shareholder's interests when other stakeholders are unaffected by their decision. This ethical imperative has been established in the literature. In cases of conflicts of interest between managers and shareholders, the board of directors of the firm has an ethical obligation to shareholders. The structure of the board can affect its ability to fulfill this obligation. Two specific cases where managerial actions have been argued to be unethical are the adoption of classified boards and poison pills. In this study, we empirically analyze the role of board structure in protecting shareholder rights in the specific case of antitakeover provisions. We test this question on a sample of firms whose shareholders have voted to remove antitakeover provisions and find that independent, focused boards are more likely to accede to shareholder resolutions than are less independent boards. Board size is also important and related to other board structures. We draw implications of this finding for future research on the ethics of board governance. (c) 2008. Business Ethics Quarterly.

The 'value creating board' surveys have been conducted in several European countries, and initiatives have also been under taken to conduct similar studies on other continents. The objectives of this article are to present methodological issues in relation to survey research about boards of directors and to document some of the methodological reflections from the 'value creating board' surveys. Some studies using 'value creating board' survey data are also presented. A main concern in survey research about boards of directors is the common method bias. Questionnaire surveys are the common method in the 'value creating board' surveys, but the development of the instrument and the interpretation of the findings are based on results and experiences from board research using other methods. Furthermore, another methodological strength of the surveys is that they have been conducted in different countries, with different samples, at different points of time, with various respondents and by different researchers. The various studies are not only individual articles, but also pieces in a big puzzle. Details about samples and responses in the Norwegian 'value creating board' surveys are presented here as an input to this discussion. The article thus serves as a point of reference for contributions drawing from these and similar surveys. Ten studies are presented to illustrate the concepts, methods, samples and contribution from the 'value creating board' surveys.

The attention to boards of directors in small firms is increasing. Traditionally they have been considered to be passive but boards in small firms are undergoing major changes. We test hypotheses of what makes boards in small firms active and allows them to contribute to value creation. Activity is seen in relation to board task involvement. Predictions based on agency theory, resource dependence theory and the resource-based view of the firm are used. We found strong support for hypotheses highlighting the use of the knowledge of the board members and various board maintenance tools, such as regular board evaluations, to increase board task involvement. Actionable advice to boards in small firms is provided.

In this article, we present an overview of empirical research on boards and governance in leading U.S. and international academic journals in general management. Samples, methods, theories, and main concepts are presented and compared. The contributions are positioned with respect to contingency perspectives, behavioral perspectives, and evolutionary perspectives. Through an analysis of 127 empirical articles, we find that most studies on boards and governance have been influenced by a research tradition that treats the board of directors as an isolated 'black box.' Only few studies explore boards in context or explore behavioral perspectives of boards. Almost no studies include evolutionary perspectives. Based on our analysis, we explore alternative research streams and outline various directions for future research.

The ways in which boards of directors can create value for SMEs has received a considerable amount of attention in the governance literature. Inconclusive results from input-output studies have asked for another approach, focusing on the influence of contingencies, board processes and actual board task performance. In this article, we examine the effect of the board's actual task performance on the value that boards create in Dutch SMEs. Because of the two-tier governance system, we distinguish between the value creation of the supervisory board and the executive board. A factor analysis on a wide range of board tasks results in six distinguishable sets of board tasks: 1) operational control, 2) behavioural control, 3) output control, 4) strategy, 5) advice and counsel, and 6) networking. Results show that - from a CEO's perspective - the supervisory boards mainly create value through their performance on the advice and counsel tasks. Executive boards are found to create value through their performance on the advice, counsel and strategy tasks.

Boards of directors can be powerful decision-making bodies, with the discretion to deploy resources and promote value creating projects and activities in the organization. However, present corporate governance practices and mainstream academic research on boards and governance has to a large extent failed to address the importance of peak performing organizations and how boards may contribute to value creation. Rather, the dominant concern has been how boards best can protect value by shielding the invested stakes of external shareholders. Moreover, this stream of research has been heavily influenced by theories and models from financial economics, where boards are expected to solve conflicts of interests between faceless owners and opportunistic managers. Influenced by this perspective, the current debate on boards of directors thus tends to be very much about the protection and distribution of shareholder value and not about peak performing organizations (Gabrielsson and Huse, 2004).

This paper provides some strong support for existing literature in an under-researched context (the emerging economies of the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe). We develop and apply a model linking Board formation and environmental uncertainty, finding some partial support for our anticipated relationships in the area of Board establishment and perceived financial sector uncertainly, although no support for our anticipated relationship between governmental sector uncertainty and Board formation. research is supportive of the broad assertion that strategy in emerging economies is different and a 'one size fits all' (generally American) approach to the questions we ask regarding strategy in emerging regions will rarely provide accurate insights for management academics and practitioners with an interest in understanding and improving management decisions in the context of emerging economies.

Thirty years have passed since Pfeffer and Salancik's seminal work on resource dependence theory (RDT). During this time RDT has been applied broadly across the research domain to explain how organizations reduce environmental interdependence and uncertainty. In this review, the authors assess the conceptual development, empirical research, and application of RDT. They structure their review around the five options that Pfeffer and Salancik propose firms can enact to minimize environmental dependences: (a) mergers/vertical integration, (b) joint ventures and other interorganizational relationships, (c) boards of directors, (d) political action, and (e) executive succession.The authors summarize past work, synthesize contemporary thought, and propose future research directions.

This book integrates and assesses the vast and rapidly growing literature on strategic leadership, which is the study of top executives and their effects on organizations. The basic premise is that, in order to understand why organizations do the things they do, or perform the way they do, we need to comprehend deeply the people at the top-their experiences, abilities, values, social connections, aspirations, and other human features. The actions-or inactions-of a relatively small number of key people at the apex of an organization can dramatically affect organizational outcomes. The scope of strategic leadership includes individual executives, especially chief executive officers (CEOs), groups of executives (top management teams, or TMTs), and governing bodies (particularly boards of directors). Accordingly, the book addresses an array of topics regarding CEOs (e.g., values, personality, motives, demography, succession, and compensation); TMTs (including composition, processes, and dynamics); and boards of directors (why boards look and behave the way they do, and the consequences of board profiles and behaviors). The book synthesizes what is known about strategic leadership and indicates new research directions. (c) 2009 by Oxford University Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

In this article, the authors develop and test a theoretical model of the effects of outside directors' human and social capital on firm growth. They posit that outside directors' board memberships and managerial experiences have additive and interactive effects. Using a longitudinal sample of high technology firms, they test their theory and find that outside directors' membership on multiple boards, industry-specific managerial experience, and firm-specific founding experience have strong additive effects on firm growth. They also find negative interaction effects, indicating the costs of acquiring and combining certain types of outside director human and social capital within the board.

Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: Over the last four decades, research on the relationship between boards of directors and strategy has proliferated. Yet to date there is little theoretical and empirical agreement regarding the question of how boards of directors contribute to strategy. This review assesses the extant literature by highlighting emerging trends and identifying several avenues for future research. Research Findings/Results: Using a content-analysis of 150 articles published in 23 management journals up to 2007, we describe and analyze how research on boards of directors and strategy has evolved over time. We illustrate how topics, theories, settings, and sources of data interact and influence insights about board-strategy relationships during three specific periods. Theoretical Implications: Our study illustrates that research on boards of directors and strategy evolved from normative and structural approaches to behavioral and cognitive approaches. Our results encourage future studies to examine the impact of institutional and context-specific factors on the (expected) contribution of boards to strategy, and to apply alternative methods to fully capture the impact of board processes and dynamics on strategy making. Practical Implications: The increasing interest in boards of directors' contribution to strategy echoes a movement towards more strategic involvement of boards of directors. However, best governance practices and the emphasis on board independence and control may hinder the board contribution to the strategic decision making. Our study invites investors and policy-makers to consider the requirements for an effective strategic task when they nominate board members and develop new regulations.

ABSTRACT Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: A coherent alternative to an economic approach of corporate governance is missing. In this paper we take steps towards developing a behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance. Research Findings/Results: Building upon concepts such as political bargaining, routinization of decision making, satisficing, and problemistic search, a behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance will focus more on (1) interactions and processes inside and outside the boardroom; (2) the fact that decision making is made by coalitions of actors and objectives are results of political bargaining; and (3) the notion that not only conflicting, but also cooperating, interests are parts of the boards' decision making and control over firm resources. Theoretical Implications: The consequences are a new research agenda for boards and corporate governance. The agenda will focus on actual instead of stylized descriptions of board behavior. In a behavioral perspective the emphasis on problems of coordination, exploration, and knowledge creation may dominate over problems of conflict of interest, exploitation, and the distribution of value. A future research agenda based on a behavioral framework calls for novel and adventurous research designs. Practical Implications: A behavioral theory of boards and corporate governance will be closer to actual board behavior than the traditional economic approach and research about boards and corporate governance may thus become more actionable for practitioners.

Despite the increasing attention of management scholars to boards of directors, there is still scant evidence on the antecedents of board task performance. The lack of significant results seems to be due to some theoretical and methodological choices followed by scholars, i.e. the almost exclusive reliance on agency theory and the use of demographic data. Following the call for dismantling the fortresses dominating past studies, this paper contributes to opening the 'black box' of boards of directors, developing a conceptual model that considers the impact of board members' diversity, commitment and critical debate on board task effectiveness in performing its service and control tasks. We collected primary data through a questionnaire survey, and we tested the model controlling for board, firm and industry characteristics. Our findings suggest that (i) the predictors we identified, and particularly the board members' commitment, are far more important than board demographics to predict board task performance; (ii) firm and industry contexts exert a significant influence on board task performance; (iii) predictors have a different impact on specific sets of tasks. Thus, our findings support the idea that several board characteristics and contingencies at both industry and firm level must be acknowledged in board design. (c) 2008 British Academy of Management.

We present results from a study about women and employee-elected board members, and fill some of the gaps in the literature about their contribution to board effectiveness. The empirical data are from a unique data set of Norwegian firms. Board effectiveness is evaluated in relation to board control tasks, including board corporate social responsibility (CSR) involvement. We found that the contributions of women and employee- elected board members varied depending on the board tasks studied. In the article we also explored the effects of the esteem of the women and employee-elected board members, and we used creative discussions in the boardroom as a mediating variable. Previous board research, including research about women and employeeelected directors, questions if the board members contribute to board effectiveness. The main message from this study is that it may be more important to ask how, rather than if, women and employee-elected board members contribute, and we need to open the black box of actual board behavior to explore how they may contribute.

Certain environmental and social behaviours have caused an increase in the social pressure felt by corporations when doing business. To palliate this pressure, companies have generated a means of legitimising their behaviour: the reporting of corporate social responsibility. The objective of this article is to test for the existence of relations between certain characteristics of the board of directors and the reporting of corporate social information. The results obtained show an important effect of the independence and diversity of the board in reporting practices, the independent members being the main promoters of such initiatives. On the contrary, board activity and the reputation of its Chairman have no effect, whereas the diversity of the organization signifi es a move backward in different stages of the process.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study analyses the form of the board-TMT interaction and the firm's level of strategic change. Relatedly, we explore the premise that there needs to be a good fit between the board of directors and the top management team to effectively bring about strategic change. Research Findings/Insights: Using archival data from a sample of 119 firms in the period 1993-2000, we found that when a synergy exists between the board and the TMT, there will be a greater inclination for strategic change. The results indicate that a board's inclination to contribute to strategic change increases as the board size increases. Equally, it is possible to accept that the relationship between board tenure and their inclination towards strategic change is not linear. Finally, the simultaneous analysis of board composition and the ratio of directors on the TMT, demonstrates that the interaction of both variables has effects on the firm's strategic change. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides empirical support in favor of an active role of the board shaping the firm's strategic decisions. We have developed and tested a set of arguments regarding with the role of the board on the firm's change in strategy. We have investigated as well, the leveraging effect of one of the variables that define the composition of the management team on the relationship board-change in strategy. Practitioner/Policy Implications: In order to create an effective board, a broader governance structure must be examined with a detailed study of aspects of the composition of the board and the TMT (previous research has only considered characteristics linked to the CEO). The dynamics of the relationships between both governance mechanisms are essential and leverage the board capability. (c) 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

This study investigates how the implementation of special attributes of CEO compensation contracts is determined by both the acquisition and the acquirer features for a set of M&A deals undertaken by Canadian acquiring firms. Our findings reveal that when agency problems are higher, manifested by larger control premiums and poor firm performance, boards of directors tend to implement stronger mechanisms of incentive alignment around M&A transactions. Relying on multiple interdisciplinary logics that are activated to explain directors' ability to effectively perform their monitoring function, we show that boards are reactive rather than proactive in dealing with agency problems. Data are further interpreted in light of the unique aspects of the Canadian institutional context. Based on asymmetric risk properties of two different groups of executive compensation modes examined in this study, testing the substitution effects between alternative governance mechanisms is proposed as an interesting avenue for future research.

We propose a research agenda that can assist in developing a dynamic and comprehensive theory of boards of directors. It is based upon the concept of temporality, with time being organised around the life-cycle metaphor, and integrates research on agency theory, decision-making theory and resource dependence theory. We identify three key roles of boards of directors: 1) Monitoring and controlling top management 2) Involvement in strategic decision-making; and 3) Providing access to resources and networks. Our analysis suggests that boards perform all three roles, but that these roles change over time. We propose clear researchable questions for each stage of the organisational life cycle as well as the transition between the stages.

This conceptual paper analyses why some companies in Russia give strong weight to the external roles and some to the internal roles of the boards of directors. The institutional background of Russian corporate governance is reviewed, concentrating on the contextual variables of time of founding, ownership type and governmental dependency, which are seen to explain the varying weight given to internal and external board roles. After arriving at several propositions, the paper finishes with suggestions for an empirical evaluation of the proposed relationships and addresses several managerial implications that stem from the discussion. This paper addresses the under-researched field of contingencies in board roles, focusing on Russia and emphasizing the importance of the prevailing institutional framework in transition economies.

The central question posed in this paper will be how to organize board composition in order to ensure a responsible corporate governance both from a CSR and a good governance perspective. Adopting a stakeholder approach to corporate governance, we analyze the arguments given by different theoretical approaches for linking specific board composition with financial performance and CSR, and discuss the empirical research conducted. Despite the inconclusive findings of empirical research, it can be argued that diverse stakeholders on the board will promote CSR activities within the firm, but at the same time will increase board capital (which ultimately may lead to a better financial performance). Finally, we propose a model for selecting board members based both on ethical and pragmatic arguments.

Drawing on the Upper Echelons perspective we examine how the composition of the board of directors affects firms' degree of internationalization. Specifically, we sample 108 large-sized European and US corporations to test whether the international experience and former government ties of the board, the average age and tenure of the directors and the diversity of their functional background are related to internationalization. We find that the international experience and the average tenure of the board are positively related and the average age of the directors is negatively related to internationalization. We find no relationship between the functional background and former government experience of the board and internationalization.

An effective system of corporate governance has both internal and external aspects that have to be sufficiently responsive if governance is to succeed. In this book, Ahmed Naciri examines these two core aspects or the latest buzzword in business and management theory. Internal aspects include ownership structure, the board of directors and committees, internal control, risk management, transparency and financial reporting. External aspects can either be market-oriented, or can take the form of credit ranking, and/or social requirements. Due to the original orientation of the Sarbanes/Oxley Law, concentrating solely on financial disclosure and given its decisive and tremendous influence on all other similar corporate governance legislations all over the world, most writings on corporate governance have dealt with solely internal corporate governance mechanisms. This book aim is to fill up the gap by using a systemic approach and giving a global picture of the corporate governance theoretical foundations, mainly by putting the emphasis on its double dimension: internal and external.

Purpose - This paper aims to examine the prevalence of directors of US Fortune 500 firms who come from an academic background, and possible unique reasons for their appointment. Design/methodology/approach - Based on extant theory of the resource-dependence roles of non-management directors, this study proposes and tests three hypotheses concerning distinctive reasons firms may appoint an academic to their boards. Academic directors may serve unique roles in increasing board demographic diversity, increasing firm intellectual capital, and providing links to local geographic constituents. Using year 2002 data from the US Fortune 500 firms, this study presents descriptive statistics and uses t-tests and x 2 tests to examine hypotheses. Findings - Firms having academics on their boards have greater board demographic diversity than firms without an academic director. Firms with academic directors have the same average emphasis on knowledge-based earnings as other firms. Academics associated with US top-ranked universities tend to be more likely to hold board seats. Firms tend to select academic directors from the geographic regions where the firm is headquartered and have a slight tendency to use them on public affairs committees. Research limitations/implications - This study's findings highlight a unique non-monitoring advantage of academic directors for firms seeking increased board diversity, and potential community/stakeholder liaisons. Practical implications - Firms wishing to increase board diversity or improve relationships with other stakeholder groups may find academic directors useful to such efforts. Academic directors appear to be just as capable as other outside directors in developing firm intellectual capital. Originality/value - This paper extends the present literature in resource dependence by examining academic directors, a new director subset. The paper is also unique in that it uses data collected from proxy statements, rather than survey data. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

122 initial public offerings (IPOs) occurring on the Stockholm Stock Exchange from January 1996 until September 2006 have been examined to assess the impact of institutional isomorphism on the selection of directors for boards facing the transition to listed companies. A high level of union representation as well as the restructuring of boards prior to an IPO and in anticipation of legal changes gives strong support for the influence of coercive isomorphism on IPO firms. Companies within industry sectors make similar choices with regard to their directors, their choices being dissimilar from their associates in other industry groupings. This supports the concepts underlying mimetic isomorphism. Finally normative isomorphism is largely supported by the reliance of corporations on a closed group of directors with similar educational backgrounds. All in all, societal and regulatory pressures, as modelled under institutional theory, are influencing the processes of corporate governance during an IPO.

This study analyses the impact of the level and the type of the intangible assets on six major financial and governance policies: financial structure, dividend pay-outs, managerial share ownership, external ownership concentration, board of directors' structure and auditing. These policies directly depend on the interactions between managers, shareholders and debt holders. Using a UK cross-sectional sample (374 firms for the year 2000), the results suggest that the bundles of financial and governance policies differ between levels of overall intangible asset intensity, levels of all intangible assets other than research and development (RD), categories of intangible assets (RD versus non-RD) and levels of stock of RD. Hence, the level and type of intangible assets seem to have significant impact on financial and governance policies. Different levels and/or types of intangible assets seem to require different portfolios of financial and governance policies.

Based on the results of a survey of 161 Canadian companies, this study focuses on board characteristics and their relationship to two essential board roles: strategy involvement and management monitoring. To examine these issues, a typology highlighting four possible board types is presented based on the level of independence and expertise of boards (authoritative, executive, institutional and convenient). The study demonstrates that board characteristics do have a significant impact on board roles. This study's findings are consistent with basic agency arguments regarding the importance of creating independent boards. However, it highlights the importance of board expertise as an essential criterion for board performance. Copyright (c) 2009, Inderscience Publishers.

The performance of healthcare non-profit public organisations is an important factor that can affect the quality of healthcare provision. This study attempts to investigate how board attributes affect board and organisational performance. Furthermore, it explores how dimensions of board effectiveness are related to organisational performance. In order to achieve these goals, survey questionnaires were sent to 120 CEOs of Greek public hospitals and 34 usable responses were received. The findings show some clear relationships between board attributes, board performance and some aspects of organisational performance. Copyright (c) 2009, Inderscience Publishers.

This article explores how the diversity of board resources and the number of women on boards affect firms' corporate social responsibility (CSR) ratings, and how, in turn, CSR influences corporate reputation. In addition, this article examines whether CSR ratings mediate the relationships among board resource diversity, gender composition, and corporate reputation. The OLS regression results using lagged data for independent and control variables were statistically significant for the gender composition hypotheses, but not for the resource diversity-based hypotheses. CSR ratings had a positive impact on reputation and mediated the relationship between the number of women on the board and corporate reputation. (c) 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: The increased attention to women on corporate boards presents new challenges to governance research. In this paper we go beyond demography and open the " black box" of board behavior by drawing upon theories of gender differences and group effectiveness. Research Findings/Insights: A unique survey of 201 Norwegian firms is used. The findings suggest that the ratio of women directors is positively associated with board strategic control. In addition, we find that the positive effects of women directors on board effectiveness are mediated through increased board development activities and through decreased level of conflict. However, our results show no evidence for a positive association between women directors and open debate. Nonetheless, open debate enhances board's strategic and operational control. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Recognizing the limitations of traditional governance theories to explain the role and contributions of women on corporate boards, this paper draws upon group effectiveness and gender differences theories to shed some light on whether and how women make a difference to board effectiveness in strategic and operational control. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Women's ability to make a contribution to the board may be attributable to their different leadership styles. The presence of women on corporate boards seems to increase board effectiveness through reducing the level of conflict and ensuring high quality of board development activities.

We develop the construct of board capital, composed of the breadth and depth of directors' human and social capital, and explore how board capital affects strategic change. Building upon resource dependence theory, we submit that board capital breadth leads to more strategic change, while board capital depth leads to less. We also recognize CEO power as a moderator of these relationships. Our hypotheses are tested using a random sample of firms on the S&P 500. We find support for the effect of board capital on strategic change, and partial support for the moderating effect of CEO power. (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Boards of directors' attention to monitoring represents an understudied topic in corporate governance. By analyzing hundreds of board meeting transcripts, we find that board members do not maintain constant levels of attention toward monitoring, but instead selectively allocate attention to their monitoring function. Drawing from the attention-based view, prospect theory, and the literature on power, we find that deviation from prior performance and CEO duality affect this allocation. Specifically, while negative deviation from prior performance increases boards' attention to monitoring, positive deviation from prior performance reduces it. The presence of duality also reduces the boards' allocation of attention to monitoring. Additional analysis demonstrates that the effects of duality are realized in part by the CEO-chair's control of the meeting's agenda and location. Finally, the results show that duality and deviation from prior performance interactively affect boards' attention to monitoring. In total, we find that board members do not consistently monitor management in order to protect shareholder value, a proposition often assumed within governance research; rather, our results demonstrate that board members' monitoring behaviors are contextually dependent. The contextual dependency of board attention to monitoring suggests that additional efforts may be needed to ensure the protection of shareholders' interests.

Using upper echelons theory and the concept of "faultlines," we argue that heterogeneity on a board of directors influences discussion of entrepreneurial issues in board meetings. We also propose that meeting context can influence such discussions. Results suggest that tenure variance, firm/industry background heterogeneity, and the proportion of directors with output-oriented backgrounds are positively associated with a board's discussion of entrepreneurial issues. Weak faultlines increase and strong faultlines decrease such discussion. Meeting informality moderates these relationships: functional background heterogeneity decreases discussion of entrepreneurial issues, but the proportion of directors with output-oriented backgrounds and strong faultlines increase it.

This study contributes to the corporate governance literature by demonstrating how greater board of director control of management at a given firm can have unanticipated adverse effects on the leadership of-other-companies. We specifically show that greater board control reduces affected CEOs' willingness to provide various forms of strategic help (e.g., advice on strategic issues) to other CEOs, making it more difficult for other-company CEOs to access assistance on strategic matters that would otherwise enhance their firms' performance. Our theory and results indicate that these effects are mediated by CEOs' reduced social identification with the "corporate elite." (c) Academy of Management Journal.

An in-depth analysis of 11 cases is used to provide insight into the neglected area of the dynamics of boards in academic spin-offs. Drawing on stage-based, resource dependence, and social network theories, we explore board formation and changes in board composition occurring in Norwegian and US spin-offs. We find that these theories are important complements to earlier research on boards in technology-based new ventures. The process of board formation is mainly driven by social networks of the founders. Although we find differences in the initial board compositions in Norwegian and US spin-offs, there is convergence over time in subsequent board changes, which are mainly driven by the social networks of the board chair. Additions of key board members are associated with the progress of a spin-off developing from one stage to another. Several avenues for future research and implications are discussed.

In modern organizations, information technologies (IT) often help drive organizational strategies. As such, IT require both judicious planning and oversight. While executive oversight over IT is quite common nowadays, several studies indicate that due to the many benefits and risks associated with IT, more/better board-level oversight may be in order. Unfortunately, there is a scarcity of research on the involvement of board members in IT governance. We attempt to partially fill this gap by empirically examining the degree to which the 27 IT governance questions that make up an IT board governance framework recommended by the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants are raised by the board members of 94 Canadian firms. We also investigate the extent to which the questions are considered important. Our findings show that: board members use only some of the IT governance questions and not all the recommended ones; there is a gap between the IT governance questions board members ask and the ones they perceive to be important; and the number and importance of IT governance questions that board members ask appear to vary with both their organization's strategic use of IT and the need for IT reliability. Implications for research and practice are offered.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: The specific monitoring effect of boards of directors versus industry regulation is unclear. In this paper, we examine how the interaction between bank-level monitoring and regulatory regimes influences the announcement period returns of acquiring banks in the US and twelve European economies. Research Findings/Insights: We study three board monitoring mechanisms - independence, CEO-chair duality, and diversity - and analyze their effectiveness in preventing underperforming merger strategies under bank regulators of varying strictness. Only under strict banking regulation regimes, do board independence and diversity improve acquisition performance. In less strict regulatory environments, corporate governance is virtually irrelevant in improving the performance outcomes of merger activities. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results indicate a complementary role between monitoring by boards and bank regulation. This study is the first to report evidence consistent with complementarity by investigating the effectiveness (rather than the prevalence) of governance arrangements across regulatory regimes. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our work offers insights to policymakers charged with improving the quality of decision-making at financial institutions. Attempts to improve the ability of bank boards to critically assess managerial initiatives are most likely to be successful if internal governance is accompanied by strict industry regulation.

Few aspects of corporate board diversity have generated the focused attention that the participation, position, and promise of women's service on the board has generated, especially in recent years. Of particular note is the extent to which women serve on large firm boards of directors (e.g., Fortune 500 firms). Increases in levels of participation have been described as glacial. While critics decry the level of participation of women on large-scale corporate boards, careful scrutiny suggests substantial progress. Concurrent with steady increases in the overall participation of women on corporate boards are increases in their presence on key board committees. Importantly, women's leadership of key board committees and their service as lead directors has improved in parallel with increases in their board memberships. These increases are particularly noteworthy in the post Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) period. Such trends suggest the continued progress of women in assuming prominent positions in the corporate governance landscape, and provide evidence that the increasingly challenging environment in the post-SOX era has not attenuated the gains noted in the pre-SOX period.

We highlight how directors and senior managers perceive the roles of a board to involve overseeing risk and compliance, strategy, governance, developing the CEO and senior management and managing stakeholders. We find that managers and directors perceive board effectiveness as linked to different combinations of these roles and that there appear to be differences in perceptions between different types of firms. We conclude that clarity around the board's role set is critical to furthering the corporate governance research agenda, and that the relationship between board roles and perceived board effectiveness differs between managers and directors.

Corporate governance and finance are dynamic academic fields that offer myriad opportunities for business ethics analysis. Within the corporate governance triad in recent years, shareholders have increased their power over boards of directors and executives through both regulation and movements to change corporate by-laws. The impact of board characteristics on firm performance has proven elusive, leading to questions concerning board processes and individual director beliefs and behaviors. At the same time, CEOs have lost considerable power, leaving many struggling to regain their control and maintain their compensation levels, while others adopt a stewardship approach to their posts. In the field of finance, the recent financial debacle has led to a reexamination of financial regulation and of the fundamental nature and purpose of the industry. All of these issues provide business ethicists fodder for investigation and analysis. (c)2010 Business Ethics Quarterly.

Manuscript Type: EmpiricalResearch Question/Issue: Do the presence and independence of nominating committees within boards of directors affect the extent of rewards and sanctions provided by the labor market to directors with a reputation for being active in monitoring management? Research Findings/Insights: Results drawn from a longitudinal sample of directors sitting on the board of 200 public French firms suggest that the stronger a director's reputation for being active in increasing control over management, the larger the number of his or her subsequent appointments to (1) boards with a nominating committee; (2) to boards with a nominating committee that excludes the CEO; and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by non-executive directors. In contrast, we found that a director's reputation of being active in increasing control over management does not impact the number of his or her subsequent appointments (1) to boards without a nominating committee; (2) to boards with a nominating committee that includes the CEO; and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by executive directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study shows that the outcome of the power struggle between the CEO and incumbent directors during the candidate selection process determines the profile of directors who will ultimately obtain the board appointment. On the one hand, independent nominating committees are likely to reduce the influence of CEOs over the process of a director's appointment, and therefore are likely to increase the recruitment of directors with reputations for being active in exercising control over managers. On the other hand, nonexistence of nominating committees or presence of weak nominating committees under the influence of the CEO decouple directors' reputations for being active in controlling management from the likelihood of obtaining new appointments. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers interested in increasing the efficiency of the labor market for directors. More specifically, it highlights the conditions under which directors with a reputation of being active in increasing control over management are likely to be rewarded by the labor market for directors. These conditions include (1) the creation of a nominating committee; (2) exclusion of the CEO from this committee; and (3) domination of this committee by outside directors.

This study examines the relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) pay fairness and future stakeholder management (SM) as well as the effect of the board of directors on this relationship. The results show that CEO pay fairness has an effect on future SM such that when underpaid, CEOs decrease SM and when overpaid, CEOs increase SM. Additionally, the relationship between CEO pay fairness and SM becomes stronger as the ratio of inside directors on the board increases, which suggests that as both management control increases and board diversity decreases, the CEO's control over SM increases. Implications for SM and CEO pay are discussed. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Purpose: This paper aims to contribute to research studies on boards of directors in the Chinese transition economy that are by far, few and limited. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses basic data compilation method to investigate the board characteristics of large and medium Chinese companies listed on the Shenzhen and Shanghai Stock Exchange between 2004 and 2006. Sample data on these companies were obtained from the China Center for Economic Research (CCER) database that contains information on at least 1,350 listed companies in a particular year. Companies with missing data or incomplete information on board attributes are not included in the sample in this paper. Studies of relationships between board characteristics and firm performance in the Chinese context are compared to those studies in the West for determining whether there is a conclusive empirical outcome. Findings: This investigation found some significant differences in board characteristics between the Chinese and Western contexts, such as non-compliance with legal requirement, equity-based compensation structure for board members, and lag in the establishment of Chinese board committees as compared to their counterparts in developed Western countries. In addition, the literature review reveals that studies of relationships between board characteristics and firm performance from the small community of scholars investigating the Chinese context produce inconclusive results similar to those studies of the West. Practical implications: The empirical findings and literature review suggest that the prototype of an effective board may vary from one industry to another, or even from one company to another, and perhaps across time for the same company. Originality/value: This contingency approach to board impact on firm performance may be relevant to companies operating in the Chinese transition economy, where factors are evolving continuously at the micro, macro, and international levels.

The board of directors is an important entity in a company, creating a link between shareholders and managers and therefore playing an important role in the governance of a firm. This study focuses on board structure and the extent of the corporate governance statement disclosure. This study found that the size of the corporate board does have some influence on the extent of the corporate governance statement disclosure. It is quite surprising to find that the rest of the variables involving the board structure do not have any association with the extent of corporate governance statement.

The study of the effectiveness of boards of directors is a tremendously interesting area of investigation, heightened by the many financial scandals of the recent past. Research efforts have suffered from several deficiencies like the inconsistency of many of the results achieved (Daily, Dalton and Cannella, 2003; Dalton, Daily, Ellstrand and Johnson, 1998; Johnson et al., 1996). It emphasises the need to go further with this research subject. Within this framework, our paper examines board effectiveness through board members' level of knowledge and experience and board structure. We understand that both dimensions: board composition and structure are not enough to board effectiveness but determine the potential to get a strategic capability. Our results show how board size, length of tenure of directors and board members' experience in senior management positions, have effects on firm financial performance.

Decades of research on corporate boards of directors resulting in diverse and often inconsistent findings have not dampened scholarly interest in the topic. Instead, researchers are attempting to more effectively model the board-firm relationship. One such modeling approach considers the power of the board in relation to top management. Drawing on upper echelons thinking (Hambrick & Mason, 1984) and the concept of managerial power (Finkelstein, 1992), this conceptual study develops the notion of board power in relation to CEO duality. Based on a framework composed of structural, ownership, expertise, and prestige power of the board, the study develops several propositions predicting the impact of board characteristics on a key aspect of managerial power - the appointment of the CEO to the position of board chair. This work contributes to scholarly understanding of the role of agency theory in explaining corporate governance phenomena by extending upper echelons thinking to the study of boards.

Intangible assets show a set of characteristics-namely, high levels of risk and uncertainty, firm-specificity, human capital intensity, low observability and long-term nature-that make them markedly distinct from other categories of assets. These characteristics are likely to have substantial impact on the levels of agency costs of debt (asset-substitution and under-investment problems) and equity (hidden action and hidden information problems), information asymmetry, bankruptcy costs, transaction costs of debt and equity, and non-debt tax shields. Consequently, this study analyses the impact of the level and the type of the intangible assets on six major financial and governance policies: financial structure, dividend payouts, managerial share ownership, external ownership concentration, board of directors' structure and auditing. Using two UK cross-sectional samples (373 and 356 firms for the years 2000 and 2001, respectively), the results suggest that the level and type of intangible assets have a negative impact on leverage and no impact on dividend payout, managerial equity ownership, outside equity ownership, board structure and audit demand.

This study contributes to the work on board composition and firm corporate social responsibility by extending it to the environmental domain. It evaluates the relationship between boards of directors' composition and environmental corporate social responsibility (ECSR) by integrating literatures on board composition, firm corporate social responsibility, and individual differences in attitudes toward and information about environmental issues. Using disclosed company data and the natural environment ratings data from Kinder Lydenberg Domini (KLD) Inc. for 78 Fortune 1000 companies, the study finds that a higher proportion of outside board directors is associated with more favorable ECSR and higher KLD strengths scores. Firms with boards composed of three or more female directors received higher KLD strengths scores. And, boards whose directors average closer to 56 years in age and those with a higher proportion of Western European directors are more likely to implement environmental governance structures or processes. Our results also reinforce growing concerns around unidimensional KLD measures. (c) 2011 SAGE Publications.

This study investigates the relationship between strong firm environmental performance and board characteristics that capture boards' monitoring and resource provision abilities during an era when the natural environment and the related strategic opportunities have increased in importance. The authors relate the proxy for strong environmental performance to board characteristics that represent boards' monitoring role (i.e., independence, CEO-chair duality, concentration of directors appointed after the CEO, and director shareholding) and resource provision role (i.e., board size, directors on multiple boards, CEOs of other firms on the board, lawyers on the board, and director tenure). The authors provide evidence consistent with both theories of board roles. Specifically, consistent with their agency theory-driven predictions, the authors find evidence of higher environmental performance in firms with higher board independence and lower concentration of directors appointed after the CEO on the board of directors. Consistent with resource dependence theory, they show that environmental performance is higher in firms that have larger boards, larger representation of active CEOs on the board, and more legal experts on the board. Their findings are generally robust to a number of sensitivity analyses. These findings have implications for managers, firms, shareholders, and regulators who act on behalf of shareholders, if they are interested in influencing environmental performance.

This study sought to investigate if there is a link between women on boards of directors and corporate sustainability. Using a sample of publicly listed firms from Australia, the results suggest some level of support that a link does exist. Boards that have a strong complement of gender diversity are expected to offer more effective monitoring of agents, as well as offer more stringent enforcement of ethical conduct, thereby minimizing affects of subversion of shareholder funds that can be detrimental to their returns. Accordingly, findings confirm a positive link between women on boards and economic growth. Because of their relational abilities, women on boards are more likely able to engage with multiple stakeholders and respond to their needs, resulting in an avenue for demonstrating social responsiveness, which is confirmed by the results. However, due to their backgrounds and work experiences, sex-based biases and stereotyping might exist in boardrooms with men directors discounting input from women directors on issues relating to environmental quality. The results of this study find that women directors are not significantly associated with environmental quality. Discussion is given to these findings along with paths for future research.

This paper offers a review of the theoretical and empirical literature addressing boards of directors within the unique organizational setting of family businesses. By reviewing and structuring past research, this paper aims to improve the understanding of how family involvement in firms affects the roles and behaviours of boards. The review of the literature is structured according to the family business board's two primary tasks as an internal administrative body, namely the exercise of control and the provision of advice. For both board tasks, theoretical perspectives and the match between theory and empirical findings will be discussed. The review concludes by offering an integrative discussion of the relevant theories and by highlighting the need for multi-theoretic, process and contextualized approaches in future research on boards of directors in family businesses.

The aim of the paper is to investigate the relationship between board reputation and corporate social performance. Specifically, we claim that corporate social performance may be a function of board attributes and we investigate the association between board reputation - in terms of board composition, competence, diversity, leadership, structure and links with the external environment - and the social performance of firms, after controlling for other companyspecific characteristics. In order to explore such a relationship, we analyse the association between corporate social performance and board reputation of the Business Ethics 100 Best Corporate Citizens over the period 2005-2007. Data on corporate social responsibility are collectedfrom the KLD's SOCRATES database, which is derived from multiple sources and is not dependent upon corporate self-reporting. Data on board reputation are hand-collected from corporate reports and proxy statements. Our empirical evidence shows that the proportions of independent, community influential and female directors are positively associated with corporate social performance, while the presence of a corporate social responsibility (CSR) committee is positively associated with community performance. In contrast, we find that CEO duality and community influential directors with multiple directorships have a negative effect on corporate social performance. (c) 2011 Taylor & Francis.

This study extends work on independent directors to examine the influence of their human capital and social capital on investor reactions to the board's CEO selection decision. We predict that human capital, as represented by the board's CEO experience and industry experience, and social capital, as represented by directors' co-working experience on the board and external directorship ties to other corporate boards, will influence the stock market reactions to new CEO appointments. In a sample of 208 new CEO appointment events in U.S. manufacturing firms between 1999 and 2003, we found that the stock market reacted favorably to the appointments made by boards with higher levels of human and social capital. We also found that the effect of internal social capital was stronger when the new CEO was an insider rather than an outsider. The implications of the results for director selection and CEO succession are discussed. (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: How are national institutional systems related to the proportion of women found on corporate boards of directors of companies listed in particular countries? Which particular types of national institutions play the most important role? We explore cross-country variation in the pattern of female representation on corporate boards and evaluate the extent to which it is associated with the nature of national institutional systems as captured in five frameworks each of which emphasizes the importance of a distinct type of national institutions. Our analysis includes 38 countries and covers the years 2001-07. Research Findings/Insights: Our findings show that as much as half of the variation in the presence of women on corporate boards across countries is attributable to national institutional systems and that culturally and legally-oriented institutional systems appear to play the most significant role in shaping board diversity. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study suggests that country-level institutions, previously neglected in studies of board diversity, play an important role in shaping the prevalence of women on corporate boards and that these need to be more fully incorporated in future research on board diversity. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The importance of national institutional systems for board diversity suggests that policy levers of a regulatory nature and national cultural characteristics are important elements in driving corporate board diversity and offer distinct opportunities for tailoring a mix of corporate governance interventions that suit the particular institutional nature of a given country.

Manuscript Tytpe: Empirical Research Question/Issues: The resource-based view of the firm may provide the theoretical explanation as to how boards can be a source of firm competitive advantage. Directors' experience, knowledge, expertise are valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable resources that make up the board potential. These resources must be integrated with other firm resources in strategic processes through dynamics of relations. Research Findings/Insights: Given the preliminary nature of this work, the empirical section is an exclusive analysis of the board's potential. Our specific aim is to establish whether resources that directors bring to board are sources of board competence and ability with consequences for international strategic decisions. To do this, we use a sample of 562 board members of 45 listed Spanish companies. Our results show that average board tenure is negatively related to the firm's degree of international diversification. Directors with long tenures may operate from the basis of routines that are built up over time and their knowledge of the firm could eventually become a less valuable resource. The empirical findings also indicate that the directors' managerial experience within the specific industry to which the firm belongs and a high level of academic achievement affects the firm's degree of international diversification. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The contribution of this article is three-fold. First, it emphasizes the role of directors in board effectiveness, investigating why and how relevant elements of directors' human capital can enhance board ability to perform their roles making up the board potential. Secondly, it refines and extends the concept of "board capability" as an adequate configuration of potential and relationship dynamics that allow boards to undertake their task competently over time. Third, this article stresses the active participation of a board in firm internationalization. Practitioner/Policy Implications: One of the important practical implications of these results refers to the selection of board members. In order to increase board effectiveness, in the context of firm internationalization, the selection process must be guided by the search of intangibles, inimitable and unique resources, that the board can capitalize on in order to differentiate its potential over competitors.

We examine whether corporate governance matters more for firms facing financial distress. We theorize that financial crisis changes the relative costs and benefits of governance mechanisms and that more independent and smaller boards become more valuable in distressed firms. We further hypothesize that CEO power becomes increasingly beneficial as concentrated power allows the firm to respond more rapidly to the crisis. Event-history analysis of the failure of publicly traded Internet firms over the period 2000-2002 confirms our hypotheses. Our results suggest that the association between governance and survival depends on firm and environmental context and that one-size-fits-all prescriptions for governance mechanisms are therefore likely to be ineffective.

Scholars and practitioners have recently devoted considerable attention to boards of directors, but far more research is needed. We still know little about how boards actually work and how their behavior may be improved to contribute to value creation. During more than two decades agency theory has been the dominant theory in studies about boards of directors. When relaxing some of the assumptions in agency theory several new pathways for new research arise. To present new perspectives on board research we follow in this essay some of the pathways arising from relaxing agency theory assumptions about complete contracts. Alternative theoretical approaches, research questions and methods are suggested. (c) 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Interactions between CEOs and their boards of directors are a prominent focus of management and strategy research. Despite the extensive literature on CEO-board relations, to date there has been limited integration of theoretical perspectives and measurement schemes. Through an extensive analysis of published studies, we hope to facilitate future research on CEO-board relations. We begin with a comparison of key theoretical approaches. Next, we conduct a content analysis of 51 empirical articles. We find that prior studies have an unbalanced focus regarding both topics and theoretical perspectives, and that there is limited consistency in the choice of measures. Based on this review, we lay out a number of promising directions for future research. We also find that, while there has been progress in international research on CEO-board relations, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the generalizability of governance theories across different geographic settings.

Each year shareholders, via exercise of their proxy votes, have the opportunity to voice their support or displeasure with firms and director nominees. Examining over 2,000 Fortune 500 director nominees, we explore those indicators available to shareholders at the time of directors' (re)election to provide insight into shareholder discontent with director monitoring. By studying actual voting behaviors, we provide new perspective to understanding director elections as a governance process. Employing a multilevel approach, we find support for agency-theoretic relationships between several firm and director characteristics and shareholder opposition to directors seeking (re)election to the board. At the firm level, we find that CEO compensation level and board size are positively related to the withholding of shareholder votes in director elections, a behavior indicative of shareholder discontent. Complementing these findings, at the director level, we find that affiliated director status, tenure, and number of outside directorships are positively related, and director block ownership is negatively related to shareholder discontent with director monitoring.

In this study, we examine whether the presence of a founder influences the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and company performance in a sample of European, publicly traded, family firms. Our findings contradict the widespread belief that smaller and more independent boards as well as nondual leadership structures always lead to better firm performance, suggesting that agency theory is limited in its explanation of the relationship between board characteristics and firm performance. We find a positive effect of board size on business performance in nonfounder-led family firms and a negative effect of board size on founder-led family businesses. The presence of independent directors on the board has a positive effect on performance when a firm is run by its founder. However, when descendants lead the firm, the presence of independent directors has a negative effect on performance. Although the effect of board meetings on firm performance is positive, this relationship is weaker when the family business is run by its founder. Finally, CEO duality improves firm performance when descendants run the business, although CEO duality has no effect on performance when the firm is led by the founder. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Offering an integrated approach, this study examines the relationship between board composition and board processes in Italian family businesses. The potential beneficial effects of outside board members on board processes such as effort norms, cohesiveness, and use of knowledge and skills are highlighted. Using a sample of 90 family business directors, it was found that boards with outside directors are perceived as more committed to the board's tasks (i.e., higher effort norms) and more cohesive. Boards of older companies with outside directors are percevied as more capable of using knowledge and skills. (c) The Author(s) 2011.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: The origins of the global financial crisis have been attributed to the combination of a housing price bubble and innovative financial instruments, as well as the lack of restraint by corporate executives and boards to engage in excessive risk-taking. The rise in subprime lending between 1997 and 2005 played a crucial role in inflating the housing price bubble. We take a unique dataset of US financial institutions heavily engaged in subprime lending and ask the following research question: Did board configuration play a role in determining whether a financial institution specialized in subprime lending? Research Findings/Insights: We use a matched-pair sample of firms in the financial industry from 1997-2005 with half of the sample specializing in subprime lending and conduct panel data logistic regression analysis. We find that the board configurations of those financial institutions that engaged in subprime lending were significantly different from those that did not. Specifically, subprime lenders had boards that were busier, had less tenure, and were less diverse with respect to gender. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study uses the group decision making perspective in the context of subprime lending to examine board of director configuration and its influence on decision making processes around the issue of risky subprime lending. Findings show that how boards were configured did influence the decision to specialize in subprime lending. We find robust support for predictions based on the group decision making perspective. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The deterioration of mortgage lending requirements that gave rise to the defaults of so many subprime loans, in retrospect, appears to be something that should have been entirely preventable. By demonstrating that subprime specialists had significant differences in board configuration that impacted group decision making, this study offers guidance to policymakers considering additional regulation and for corporate officers examining corporate governance issues.

Prior research shows that firms benefit from the social capital of their boards of directors but has not explored the antecedents of new director social capital. We argue that firms can attract directors with social capital by offering more compensation. We also argue that more complex firms (firms with a greater scale and scope of operations) are more attractive to such directors because of the greater experience and exposure that such directorships provide. Similarly, we argue that firms with high-status directors on their current boards will be more attractive to directors with social capital. We analyse the social capital of new outside directors added to boards of semiconductor firms between 1993 and 2007. Surprisingly, we find no support for the hypothesis that higher compensation is associated with adding directors with high status or board ties. However, firm complexity is associated with the ability to add new directors who have social capital, and the status of current board members is associated with the ability to add new directors who also have high status.

In the slipstream of several large-scale corporate scandals, the board of directors has gained a pivotal position in the corporate governance debate. However, due to an overreliance on particular methodological (i. e. input-output studies) and theoretical (i. e. agency theory) research fortresses in past board research, academic knowledge concerning how this important governance mechanism actually operates and functions remains relatively limited. This theoretical paper aims to contribute to the promising stream of research which focuses on behavioural perspectives and processes within the corporate board, by delving into one of the research areas perhaps plagued most by these predominant approaches: board leadership. In adopting a team perspective on the board of directors our study goes beyond traditional board leadership research, which has turned a blind eye on actual leadership dynamics, by examining leadership processes and behaviours inside the board team. Specifically, we develop a conceptual framework addressing a novel and ethical approach to team leadership within the board, i. e. shared leadership, which has previously been demonstrated to result in performance benefits in various other team settings.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of prior firm performance on board composition and governance structure. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 90 companies listed on National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations were used for this study. Hypotheses were tested using both general linear regression and logit regression analyses. Findings: The results showed that prior negative change in firm performance was significantly related to a decrease in the overall number of directors and a decrease in the number of outside directors. Research limitations/implications: The sample size used in this study was relatively small and the focus was on small to medium-sized firms, so the results found here may not apply to firms larger than those used in our sample. Practical implications: Directors may want to consider the implications for governance practices found in this study, specifically, whether smaller boards with fewer outsiders are appropriate following periods of performance decline. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to examine the effects of trends in prior firm performance on board composition and chief executive officer duality.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: This study examines the conditions under which foreign subsidiaries maintain active boards of directors. Active boards are in this study defined as boards that perform tasks beyond fulfilling local legal requirements. We focus on both monitoring and service roles. Research Findings/Insights: Based on a sample of 83 foreign subsidiaries operating in Belgium with headquarters in 14 different countries, we find that a foreign subsidiary is more likely to maintain an active board if it is a world mandate subsidiary, which has worldwide responsibility for a product line and performs a broad scope of value-added activities. Moreover, a foreign subsidiary is more likely to maintain an active board if it is larger relative to the multinational enterprise (MNE), if it has a higher level of local responsiveness, and if its past performance is poorer. Additionally, the presence of an active board in a foreign subsidiary is related to other control mechanisms deployed in the subsidiary. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results highlight the conditions under which foreign subsidiaries are likely to maintain active boards. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence that agency theory and resource dependence theory are relevant and complementary in the analysis of active boards in foreign subsidiaries. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that an active board may be a control mechanism to govern foreign subsidiaries and an instrument to deal with the external environment. Corporate governance regulators may consider developing governance recommendations that emphasize the importance of subsidiary boards in the oversight of foreign subsidiaries.

Purpose - Despite the extensive study of director interlocks very little is known about gendered director networks. Boards of directors are primarily male; globally, only 5-20 per cent of directors are women and change is described as glacially slow. The extent to which women directors are central to the network, or pushed to the margins, is unknown. Using the tools of social network analysis we extract the components of three director networks, a global and two national networks and locate the women directors. The paper aims to examine the persistence of director networks over time to determine whether gender related differences - apart from size - contribute to the apparent resistance to change. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses a longitudinal approach, comparing director networks on a global network scale (2004 and 2007 Fortune Global 200) and a national one (2004 and 2007 New Zealand Stock Exchange) with the iconic 1999 Fortune US 1000 dataset. After extracting the largest connected component, the female directors are separated out. From the 2004 and 2007 data director turnover is calculated to determine the stability of the networks. Findings - Female directors are more likely to be found in the largest connected component of the mixed gender network, indicating that they are not marginalised. Despite high turnover rates, director networks are stable over time which may manifest as resistance to change. Originality/value - The structure of gendered director networks is unknown and the location of women directors in the network components has not been considered in board diversity research. The results point to an underlying gender equity in all director networks. A new theoretical approach, glass network theory, has implications for boardroom diversity interventions.

In the wake of this decade's corporate scandals, crimes and excesses, improving the effectiveness of corporate governance in the United States has become a priority. An important influence on a board's effectiveness at monitoring is its members degree of independence from senior management. While the current definition of independence revolves around the absence of familial and economic connections between a firm and its directors, research suggests that this standard may be inadequate in ensuring independent oversight. Rather, diversity along racial, gender and other dimensions has been proposed as a potentially more effective standard for board independence. This is especially welcome news for women, who currently comprise 51 per cent of the US managerial workforce but only 14.8 per cent of the directors on boards of large, publicly traded US corporations. Some explain the current dearth of women board members by claiming that there are no qualified women available for board service and/or that women are not interested in board service. However, there is more anecdotal rather than empirical evidence on the issue. Surveying women at a women's leadership conference in Boston, this research investigates the extent to which women are currently involved in some type of board service and the extent to which women aspire to future board service. We find that women are currently more active in governance activities than prior research on corporate boards suggests and that they aspire to play a continued and expanded role in governance activities.

The concept of stakeholder engagement is gaining increasing attention in the mainstream media and may feature as part of a corporation's strategy for corporate social responsibility. Not only are boards considering how they might engage with key stakeholders, but stakeholders are also pursuing greater participation in the strategic decisions of companies in which they invest. While this is an emerging concept in companies governed by unitary boards, as in North America, the issue of stakeholder engagement in various forms is also entering debate in other countries around the world. In general, however, the idea of shareholder or stakeholder representation on the boards of most UK and Commonwealth companies is anathema. Forces now influencing the development of strategies for stakeholder engagement and the rise of active investors include changing corporate governance rules which give investors more power in the election of directors, the increasing role of pension plans and hedge fund investment groups which have produced investors who keep a close eye on company performance and value, and a sluggish or turbulent stock market as a result of the financial crisis initiated by the credit crunch in the sub-prime mortgage markets. In this paper the phenomenon of stakeholder representation is examined and results of a recent survey conducted among a large sample of New Zealand directors are presented. The findings suggest that these traditionally oriented boards are increasingly inwardly focused and are without an agenda for building and managing shareholder and stakeholder relations. Accordingly, such boards are unlikely to regard stakeholder engagement as a serious strategic issue and are thus also likely to miss significant opportunities in the changed business environment to benefit from stakeholder support.

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to draw on the perspectives and experiences of New Zealand board members to propose a balanced scorecard (BSC) for use in measuring and managing the performance of boards. Design/methodology/approach The views of 35 board members were elicited via semi-structured interviews. The interview evidence was analysed using a multi-step coding process to arrive at key themes on the functions, characteristics and outcomes of effective and ineffective boards. These themes were then used as a basis for proposing an appropriate structure and content for a BSC that reflects board members' perceptions of key factors driving board performance. Findings New Zealand board members see behavioural measures of board performance as generally more useful than operational and financial measures. Further, strong relationships and strategic clarity are seen as both drivers of good performance and key outcomes of effective boards. Consequently, the proposed BSC incorporates multi-dimensional outcome (i.e. lagging) measures. It also recognises the importance of including subjective measures, rather than focusing on readily quantifiable measures that board members perceive as less informative. Research limitations/implications This paper provides insight into the perspectives of practising board members and informs the literature on board effectiveness. The proposed BSC adds to the performance management literature in regard to evaluating and managing the performance of boards. However, further studies are now required to test its practical utility. Practical implications The proposed BSC provides a potentially useful tool for evaluating the performance of boards of directors. Originality/value Few studies of board effectiveness have accessed the views and experiences of practising board members as this study does. Also, little prior research exists on the potential for applying a BSC approach to measuring and managing board performance. (c) Copyright - 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose: Amid ongoing criticism that corporate boards do not receive adequate information to help them fulfill their current and emerging roles, the purpose of this paper is to focus on the type of information directors receive. Specifically, to examine whether greater board independence and greater board expertise were associated with receiving more information, in five specific categories. Design/methodology/approach: Hypotheses about the relationships between the composition of corporate boards and the various types of information they receive were tested by means of a survey of 161 Canadian companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Findings: The authors findings indicate a strong association between board expertise and each type of information received and suggest a weaker relationship between board independence and information received. Specifically, the results demonstrate that more independent boards do not receive larger amounts of information that is more forward-looking in nature. Research limitations/implications: These findings contribute to the literature on governance by providing relevant empirical evidence, based on primary data on board information issues. However, these results must be interpreted within the context of the use of various perceptual measures. Practical implications: Now that the composition of corporate boards has changed considerably, the findings of this study underline the need to re-examine the supporting information processes. Hence, this study should help provide guidance to organizations examining the content of their current information strategy. Originality/value: An important contribution of this study is its detailed characterization of the information provided to corporate boards, including financial and non-financial information and reflecting the five traditional stages of the strategic management process.

Boards of directors are a vital part of corporate governance systems. In the on-going discussion about the development of national corporate governance systems, however, little interest has been given to the issue of how and why board behavior changes over time. In this article, we use an institutional approach and study the development of board behavior in Sweden between 1994 and 2004 and if it is affected by board composition and board network characteristics. In order to do so, we introduce the constructs of board activities, i. e. what the boards do, and board involvement, i.e. when in the decision process they get involved. Findings show that range of board activities and board involvement have increased drastically during this period, which indicates a change in the logic of appropriateness of Swedish board behavior. There are robust indications that new types of actors affect activities and involvement positively, as do board interlocks, whereas network centrality affects activities and involvement negatively.

Identifying, attracting, and maintaining the engagement of the right composition of people for a non-profit Board is a major challenge. Executives should ensure that their Boards accurately represent the stakeholders that matter, both from industry and the community. The purpose of this paper is to describe ways and offer propositions for effective non-profit executives to identify, recruit, and motivate the continuing engagement of the members needed on their Boards in order to acquire resources critical to their sustained success. The Convention and Visitors Bureaus (CVBs) are used as an example, since at least 93 percent of CVBs have a governance structure that includes a Board of Directors. Successfully attracting the right mix of stakeholders is a result of an extensive recruitment effort by the CVB executive. Prior research reports that successful executives take great care in making selection decisions that reflect the interests of the community in the Board's composition. Based on the literature on Boards and governance, the authors develop propositions regarding the composition of CVB Boards. While the research is exploratory, it is found that CVBs with more diverse Boards are more successful than those with less diverse Boards. It is argued that effective CVBs use a thoughtful process for heterogeneous Board selection. It is also suggested that Board performance should be evaluated on an annual basis to recognize the need for active involvement in the Board selection process. The successful selection of Board members is important because of the implications for Board effectiveness. While there is a large body of literature offering advice on Board selection, there is little on recruitment. Moreover, there is little discussion of Board composition strategy based on balancing access to critical resources of stakeholders. (c) 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

The theoretical framework for a comprehensive trust model is presented using McAllister's affect- and cognitive-based trust model and Siegrist, Earle, and Gutscher's trust-confidence-cooperation model as the foundation. The enhanced model includes cognitive and affective domains of personality, culture, motivation, reliability, competence, and intuition (as a latent variable) to measure perception of trust between two individuals. The model applies the intercognition of self-leadership for improving trust and building effective relationships within boards of directors. Furthermore, the authors consider the multiplicity of board of director roles and how such complexity affects formation and maintenance of optimal trust. (c) Baker College 2011.

This paper studies the relationship between personal stock donation by top executives and board of directors (insiders) of publicly traded corporations and their personal tax, shareholders' returns, and social responsibility. The study finds evidence that the timing of stock donations is driven by personal tax gain. The study further shows, comparing stock gift corporations relative to their non-stock gift cohorts, that personal stock gifts are associated with lower short-term and long-term stock returns to shareholders. This implies that stock donation driven by insiders' personal gain adversely affects shareholder wealth. However, the likelihood and intensity of insiders to make personal stock donation is reduced when firms have strong corporate social responsibility (CSR). Agency theory explains insiders' opportunistic behavior, stakeholder theory is also supported by evidence that stock donation is negatively related to CSR, and stewardship theory offers a different view to explain the rationale behind insiders' stock donation and shareholders' reactions to stock gifts.

What is a board of directors to do, in the face of competing demands on the resources of the company and conflicting perspectives on what their roles are and should be? Corporate governance has become a central theme in management in the past two decades owing to a string of major corporate failures and evidence that the boards of these companies either failed to grasp the scale of the problems or failed to stand up to managers. Those corporations might have set out upon the wrong strategy, or engaged in fraud, or unethical behaviour, or simply suffered from bad luck. Their failures have led to a debate both with industry and in public policy about what mechanisms might prevent a recurrence, not least because they show how great the influence of the corporate sector is on society at large. In this chapter we consider how boards contribute to governing the corporation, the tensions they face along the way, and how theories of corporate governance point to the persistence of those tensions.

This research examines how the board of directors affects the relationship between Research and Development (R&D) investment and firm performance. The study, conducted on a sample of French companies listed on Euronext Paris, shows that the relationship between R&D investment and firm performance is significantly positive. However, this relationship varies significantly with the characteristics of the board of directors. Specifically, the results show that board independence, chief executive officer and chairman duality and the number of board meetings have a positive effect on the R&D investment-firm performance relationship, whereas board size affects this relationship negatively.

Drawing on Agency Theory this article investigates the relationship between board size and European firms' performance. The focus is on the implicit differences between financial and non-financial firms. In particular the paper addresses the following questions: does board size influence firm performance? Is financial intermediaries' corporate governance different from that of non-financial companies? The study analyses the governance of the largest listed European companies which make up the Eurotop 100 index. Companies come from 12 different countries and are subject to different regulatory and self-discipline codes. Referring to the Eurotop index the focus is on the relation between the overall size of the board of directors and the level of performance measured as Tobin's Q and Return on Assets. Diverging results emerge depending on the typology of the firm. In particular, results suggest that for non-financial companies large boards negatively influence firm performance, whereas financial intermediaries seem to be different because of the non-relation between their board size and performance.

The role of boards in firm strategy has long been the subject of debate. Over the last four decades, research on the relationship between boards of directors and strategy has proliferated. Ye t to date there is little theoretical and empirical study regarding the question of how board information affects the boards of directors' strategic involvement. Using a survey data from 104 responses of chairpersons collected in the year of 2010 in China, we examine how board information affects boards' behaviors of strategic involvement. Our study shows that quality of information, information diversity, frequency of board interaction, and proactive seeking information positively influence boards' strategy monitoring and advisory. These findings provide empirical support for agency theory and resource dependence theory on boards. (c) 2011 IEEE.

In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, many industrialized States have increased their stakes in corporations (State-owned enterprises) worldwide. Therefore, the idea of governments as value-creating institution is increasing and questions concerning innovation are even more pressing. Indeed, there has been a great deal of both scholarly and professional interest in innovation believing that it is essential to public sector effectiveness. Theoretical insights from the innovation literature, agency and resource-based theories are done seeking to add knowledge on the relationships between governance mechanisms and State-owned enterprises' innovation. The analysis is on a sample of 88 Norwegian State-owned enterprises mainly operating in the service sector. The results show that some characteristics of the board of directors (e.g., composition, board working-style and board members' knowledge and competences) significantly influence innovation types. Implications for theory and practice and future research directions are discussed. (c) 2011, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The purpose of this paper is to compare the levels of representation of women on boards of directors in five countries, and especially to determine if the culture of a country is a factor that influences the possibility of women achieving positions on boards of directors. We use the cultural dimensions of Hofstede (1980) and GLOBE (House et al., 2004), and the results show that the culture of a country can be a factor in explaining the different levels of representation of women at board of directors. In particular, three of the four cultural dimensions are seen to be significant: power distance, uncertainty avoidance and masculinity.

This study considers the legitimacy of shareholder activism as a means of exercising influence in the corporate decision-making process and identifies self-reformed boards as a superior solution to the issues that activists attempt to address. We conceptualise the board of directors' role as representing the interests of multiple principals. When any one principal is able to serve its own interests by influencing corporate decision-making through shareholder activism, other principals' interests may be compromised. We argue that a better long-term solution lies not with activist shareholders, but with culturally reformed boards. We suggest a set of self-reform initiatives that would help them to achieve their potential. We develop a conceptual framework for the arguments in favour of boards taking a leadership role in corporate engagement with shareholders and stakeholders. To the extent that boards are unable to implement self-reform, governments may need to develop public policy initiatives for corporate governance reform. (c) 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The literature on the relationships between board attributes and corporate performance is mixed, and one important reason is that the intermediate variable, i.e., board behaviors are ignored. With the data coming from listed company of China, the paper empirically researches the relationship between the characteristics and monitoring function of board. Using Principal Component Analysis, we get 6 variables reflecting the characteristics of board and 4 variables for the monitoring function. The study shows that the share held ratio of board's members has a negative impact on the directing function of board significantly, but the gender ratio and the average age of board members has a positive impact on the position function of board significantly. This may be valuable to regulate the behavior of board. (c) 2011 IEEE.

This paper explores board decision-making in social enterprises. It argues that while dominant theoretical frameworks (agency and stakeholder theories) help to understand the challenges faced by the boards of social enterprises, they need to be complemented to account, more adequately, for challenges deriving from the confounding logics framing valuations of organizational effectiveness in social enterprises. The paper identifies pace of decision-making as a crucial variable that requires further research attention and, building on the literature on group decision and dynamics, it advances several factors that can frame the expediency (or sluggishness) with which the boards of social enterprises take decisions.

This paper examines the effects of director ownership and the proportion of outside directors on firms' commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR). Using a sample of 453 Hong Kong listed companies for 2005, we find that there is a non-linear relationship between the level of director ownership and firms' engagement in CSR behavior. Commitment to CSR first increases as the proportion of director ownership increases up to 50% and then decreases as that proportion of ownership grows higher. Further, the proportion of outside directors on the board exhibits a positive relationship with the level of CSR commitment. These results provide explanations for firms' commitment to CSR from the corporate governance perspective.

Corporate governance scholars are increasingly interested in firms' social and environmental performance. Empirical research in this area, however, has moved forward in an uncoordinated fashion, producing fragmented and contradictory results. Our paper seeks to address this situation by adopting a fact-based research approach that comprehensively explores the link between corporate governance and environmental performance. Specifically, we aim to understand how the relationships between and among the firms' owners, managers, and boards of directors influence environmental performance. We are particularly interested in understanding the interactions among these three key sets of actors. In the end, we offer some observations about governance practices and discuss the implications for theory. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Drawing on stakeholder theory, this paper examines the relationship of board composition, leadership and structure on sustainability disclosure. We discuss that good corporate governance and sustainability disclosure can be seen as complementary mechanisms of legitimacy that companies may use to dialogue with stakeholders. Specifically we claim that, as disclosure policies emanate from the board of directors, sustainability disclosure may be a function of the board attributes: we investigate the relationship between different characteristics of the board and sustainability disclosures among US and European companies. Our results show that in order to explain the effect of board composition on sustainability disclosure we need to go beyond the narrow and traditional distinction between insider and independent directors, focusing on the specific characteristics of each director.

This research focuses on family-controlled firms as an important type of family firms, and demonstrates how external parties in the governance (ownership and board of directors) can serve as a catalyst for their internationalization. Our framework also embraces the moderating effects of the competitive environmental heterogeneity and past performance on the relationship between external, nonfamily involvement in governance, and internationalization (scale and scope). The hypotheses are tested on a sample of 351 Swedish family-controlled firms. Our findings extend previous research on family firms and their internationalization, especially addressing some of the prior mixed findings, and offers implications for both theory and practice.

Director selection is a critical board process and outcome that influences the board and its overall performance. Because of this influence, research from a variety of different disciplinary areas examines the antecedents and outcomes of director selection. The authors offer a synthesis of this literature from these different disciplines. The authors first delineate the process that drives the selection of an individual to a board. They then review and categorize the director selection literature into two distinct perspectives-a rational economic perspective focused on the organization-level benefits driving the selection decision and a socialized perspective emphasizing the social processes that influence the director selection process. Finally, from their review, the authors suggest promising areas of future research regarding director selection. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Purpose: Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, the study aims to link board demographic diversity and independence to corporate social performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from various sources for a sample of 475 publicly traded Fortune 500 companies between the years 2007 and 2008. Findings: It is found that board gender diversity is positively related to institutional and technical strength ratings, while board racial diversity is positively related to institutional strength rating only. Both the proportion of outside directors and CEO non-duality were negatively associated with institutional and technical weakness ratings. Research limitations/implications: The sample was predominantly large, publicly traded national and international corporations, which might limit the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: Management personnel should be cognizant of how board configurations and leadership structure may influence their corporate reputation for social responsibility. Efforts should be made to foster a group dynamic that is conducive to effective board functioning. Originality/value: Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between board characteristics and corporate social performance. This study contributes to the literature by examining such associations. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper investigates the role of board structure and the effect of ownership structures on firm performance in New Zealand's listed firms. Several studies, the majority from the U.S., U.K. and Japan, have examined the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms, ownership structure and firm performance. Those studies yielded different results, affected by the nature of the prevailing governance system for each country. Investigating New Zealand's listed firms could enhance the diversity of the growing body of work that examines this relationship. Though the majority of studies only tested a linear relationship between variables, a number of studies have found a non-linear relationship between board structures, ownership structures and firm performance, and this study confirms the non-linear relationship. Using a balanced panel of 79 New Zealand listed firms, this study employs a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) for robustness. The result reveals that board of directors, board committees, and managerial ownership have a positive and significant impact on firm performance. Meanwhile, nonexecutive directors, female directors on the board and blockholder ownership lower New Zealand firm performance.

Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/Issue: To what extent can group faultlines and their potential value-destroying effects be detected on corporate boards? Task-related attributes of the type of directorship, education, board tenure, and financial background of board members are considered as directors' characteristics that give rise to the faultline phenomenon. The impact of task-related faultlines on firm performance as well as the moderating effects of busy boards, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) tenure, executive directors' (EDs) compensation structure, and the average non-executive directors' (NEDs) involvement in board committees are examined. Research Findings/Insights: Using a panel of FTSE 350 companies from 1999 to 2008, we find a strong negative effect of task-related faultlines on firm performance. Further exploration of the moderating effects demonstrates that the condition of a busy board and CEO tenure exacerbate the negative effects of faultlines. At the same time, the executive pay contingency is found to have a remedying effect on boardroom cohesiveness, whereas the involvement of NEDs in board committee work is not likely to make the adverse effects of board faultlines less pronounced. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Based on the arguments of social identity theory, this study shows that task-related faultlines on corporate boards have strong negative value-creating implications. The positive moderating impact of the executive compensation structure renders support to agency theory predictions about executive incentive alignment. This work also underlines the usefulness of the concept of faultlines in the corporate governance literature, because unitary boards, where NEDs and EDs share board responsibility, exhibit pre-existing factions, similar to top management teams of family-controlled firms and teams managing international joint-ventures. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This research points to the importance of a careful selection process of directors by nomination committees. It also underlines the role for active leadership on boards, who should be aware of available strategies to ameliorate the negative consequences of board schisms, such as accentuating superordinate board identity and/ or informal meetings.

Previous research brought evidence of the influence of board composition for bringing strategic resources for innovation, as well as evidence of positive outcomes of board diversity. Only a few studies have investigated the effects of various indicators of board diversity on innovation. In this paper, we will explore the relationship between several aspects of board diversity (gender and age) and four types of innovation, i.e. product, process, organizational, marketing from a sample of 176 French firms based on data from French Community Innovation Survey (CIS) in 2008 and annual reports. Our results show evidence of the influence of board diversity on all types of innovation except process innovation. Findings provide discussions for the impact of board diversity on innovation.

Directors may play their most important role during organizational crisis; however, extant research suggests that they are often more willing to exit than remain on the board of a firm facing a crisis. We develop theory regarding directors' voluntary exit by integrating insights from identity theories with the organizational crises literature. Specifically, we model how directors' individual, relational, and collective identities work sometimes in concert and other times in opposition to each other to influence directors' voluntary decisions to remain on or exit from a board facing an organizational crisis.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: The global financial crisis in 2008 has generated increasing recognition of the importance of board diversity reflected amidst the capabilities and skills of directors on a board. As the primary institutional mechanism designed to strengthen the director selection process, nomination committees (NCs) occupy centre stage of this discussion. However, there is a dearth of studies which focus either specifically on NCs or on diversity as a board composition outcome. In this study, we examine the research question of the likely antecedents in terms of NC characteristics of two board composition outcomes, i.e., diversity as variety in terms of gender and nationality, and diversity as separation in terms of a board demographic faultline. Research Findings/Insights: For a panel of FTSE350 companies from 1999 to 2008, we find that the increasing presence on the NC of females or non-British nationals is likely to have a positive impact on the level of board gender and nationality diversity, respectively. In addition, we report that the presence of the chief executive officer (CEO) on the NC is found to interact with the NC independence, as a result of which a board demographic faultline is likely to emerge. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We bring together three concepts from social psychology research to create the theoretical basis for our study of the influence of NCs on board diversity: these are similarity-attraction, homosocial reproduction, and social identity. The strong empirical findings suggest that these socio-psychological dimensions are applicable to the operations of NCs, which has implications for the outcomes of the director nomination and selection process, and consequently also for board composition. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research indicates that NC characteristics are significant antecedents of board diversity, hence composition of the NC is an important step and pre-requisite for assembling a diverse board. For example, appointing females and/or non-nationals to the NC increases the likelihood of greater representation of females and/or non-nationals on the entire board. At the same time, our evidence suggests that the presence of the CEO amidst the majority of non-executive directors (NEDs) on the NC is detrimental for board cohesiveness.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: We examine whether director interlocks enable or inhibit a firm's adoption of a proactive environmental strategy. Specifically, using resource dependence theory, we argue that director interlocks with suppliers are linked to varying likelihoods that a firm adopts a proactive environmental strategy, depending on the relation between the provided resources and the environmental approach. Research Findings/Insight: Based on a sample of US electric firms, our results show that director interlocks with firms providing knowledge-intensive business services are positively linked to the adoption of proactive environmental strategies. However, director interlocks with firms providing financial resources and fossil fuel are negatively related to the adoption of these strategies for our sample. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Board linkages may enable and inhibit proactive environmental strategies. We contribute to resource dependence theory by offering empirical evidence that the reduction of uncertainty about critical resources by director interlocks may either make business change easier or constrict a firm's autonomy, making change more difficult. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The influence of interlocking directors varies depending on the type of resources that director interlocks transfer to their organizations. As a result, the selection of specific director interlocks can become very important to the strategic goals of the firm. Regulators should continue to pay attention to potential risks for other stakeholders from director interlocks. (c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

There is a growing consensus that boards of directors "matter," but the specific effects of board influences on organizational innovation remain unclear. Although boards of directors have been studied extensively in diverse disciplines-finance, management, sociology, nonprofit management, and economics-those studies have focused primarily on how board variables influence organizational effectiveness and performance. Missing from these studies is explanation of the relationships between the board of directors and organizational innovation (Wu, 2008a). This article links previous research and theories on governance and organizational innovation, examines how the board of directors may influence organizational innovation, and presents an integrative model that includes direct and indirect linkages between the board demographic and process variables, board effectiveness, and organizational innovation.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the effects of corporate governance factors on the firm performance and executive compensation linkage. Specifically, we examine how domestic corporate-appointed directors, bank-appointed directors and foreign ownership moderate the relationship between firm profitability, sales growth, and executive bonus pay in Japanese firms. Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of the largest Japanese manufacturing companies from 1997 to 2007, we find that corporate-appointed directors positively moderate the relationship between firm growth and bonus pay, while foreign shareholders exhibit a positive moderating effect on the relationship between firm profitability and bonus pay. Bank-appointed directors are straddled between their profitability orientation and relational role: They link firm profitability and bonus pay, but also show positive influence on the firm growth and bonus pay relationship. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study makes a contribution to research on ownership heterogeneity and executive compensation by empirically showing that different owners and directors affiliated with certain ownership groups have varied implications on the firm performance-executive pay relationship. It also makes a contribution to research on corporate governance change by providing insights on how different actors facilitate shifts in the linkage between performance and pay. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our findings offer insights to stakeholders to pay attention to ownership structure and board composition in acknowledging the varied financial motivation of executives to pursue growth and/or profitability.

This article brings together research on philanthropy, family business, and governance to examine patterns of giving by U.S. family versus nonfamily independent foundations. The authors use a sample comprising the 200 largest U.S. independent foundations in 2007 to show that family foundations are more focused in their grantmaking than nonfamily foundations. Board size moderates this relationship. They also offer a new typology of family foundations to show that the generation stage of the family and the foundation board's composition are associated with different levels of grantmaking diversity in family foundations but in dissimilar ways. Scholarly and practical implications are discussed. (c) The Author(s) 2012.

Although there is a paucity of female corporate directors in Canada, women are slowly managing to break the gender barrier of all-male boards of directors. Using resource dependency theory a model is developed that identifies the human capital characteristics that contribute to a woman being appointed to an all-male board. The model is tested on a sample of 193 Canadian firms that appointed women to their boards of directors between 1996 and 2004. The results show that women who are appointed to all-male boards have specialized knowledge skills; either they have firm-specific knowledge as insiders, or they are support specialists with a specific financial or legal expertise.

Owner-managers of private family businesses are vulnerable to escalation of commitment, which can lead to costly failure. In an effort to help private family businesses reduce such costs and contribute to the resource dependence literature, we extend prior research on escalation of commitment (Staw, 1981). Specifically, we develop a model that examines how outside board members influence the antecedents, and moderate the processes, that lead to escalation of commitment. Our work encourages the use of outside board members, insofar as they are likely to help the owner-managers of private family businesses to avoid escalation of commitment. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper investigates the effect of new governmental regulations on corporate Boards of Directors (BODs). We have reviewed the literature pertaining to agency theory and resource dependency theory, both of which have been assumed to explain the actions of BODs. We examine the predictions of both agency theory and resource dependence theory regarding both the structure and actions of BODs in times of governmental regulatory change. We then describe four historical events in which radical changes were required by certain governmental regulations, and discuss responses by BODs to each event, and present a discussion of these responses and how they adhere to or stray from the predictions of both agency theory and resource dependence theory. We conclude the paper with recommendations for the direction of further study.

Corporatization, or the adoption of more business-like practices or governance arrangements by government agencies, has been shown to lead to improvements in performance. However, why corporatization leads to improved performance is not well understood. There are competing theories as to how corporatization may improve performance, but because of confounding factors empirical studies have difficulty in identifying causal relationships. We address these issues in our analysis of the corporatization of six Australian state forest agencies that took place in the past two decades, focusing on: (1) improvements in efficiency and (2) improved profitability or cost recovery. The results confirm that corporatization leads to enhanced commercial performance through improving clarity around business decisions and increasing the autonomy of managers. A key feature is the establishment of new governance arrangements and how they are implemented. Our results suggest that mechanisms such as the creation of an "independent" board of directors are important to create an "arm's length" relationship between the government and the new entity, thereby improving clarity in business decisions.

Existing research on a board-of-director-sustainability performance relationship have largely examined inside directors, outside directors, and gender diversity-yet empirical results have yet to offer any definitive answers. I posit that this previous research lacks a thorough examination of the role of boards and the means and mechanisms by which they influence performance. Drawing on the board capital perspective and the role of boards, this paper develops a model that highlights the influence of board capital on the future sustainability performance of firms. The model takes into account specific types of human and social capital of outside directors which have previously been unexamined. Beyond the board capital perspective, an argument is put forth that values are largely neglected in the examination of boards of directors, but are necessary in the study of sustainability because of its normative implications. I therefore account for the value attunement concept as a moderating variable in the model The paper draws on corporate governance and business ethics' literature to generate propositions and offer original insight into the drivers of sustainability performance in organizations.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between the board diversity and the investments in innovation in a sample of companies listed on the Italian Stock Exchange (named Borsa Italiana) and operating in the consumer goods and in the consumer services industry. This sample covers the period from 2006 to 2010 and contains 345 observations. Drawing on the literature review, we pinpointed six hypotheses related to the impact on the investments in innovation of the following independent variables: 1. presence of outside directors; 2. average number of the other positions held by the members of the board; 3. minority shareholder representatives on the board; 4. presence of women on the board of directors; 5. number of committees; 6. frequency of board meetings. Furthermore, on the basis of the previous empirical studies, to measure the investments in innovation (the dependent variable), we chose these accounting ratios: total intangible assets divided by total assets and total R&D costs divided by total sales. From the methodology standpoint, we used both the bivariate statistic (i.e. Pearson Correlations and Anova one way) and the multivariate one (i.e. OLS regression analysis with robust standard errors calculated by the Newey-West, HAC method). Our findings confirm the previous studies and show that, also for the Italian listed companies operating in the industries mentioned earlier, the outsiders as well as the frequency of meetings held by the Strategy Committee assume a relevant role in supporting the investments in innovation. Conversely, the other independent variables concerning board diversity (i.e. women, minority shareholder representatives etc.) are not statistically significant and, as a result, do not influence the investments in innovation.

This study explored the role of strategic leadership in declining firms by empirically examining CEOs' founder status and extensiveness of external board of director appointments as predictors of the likelihood of successful turnaround. The authors used the resource dependence and board interlock literatures to develop their hypotheses. Their analysis of data collected from a matched pair of 82 turnaround and bankrupt U.S. firms indicate that the extensiveness of CEOs' external board appointments significantly increase the likelihood of turnaround. Contrary to the authors' prediction, there was no significant relationship between founder status and likelihood of turnaround. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

This study explains the inconsistent findings of previous research on board management by examining the direct and interaction effects of board independence and the top management team's external ties on firm performance. The results obtained using a multiyear sample of firms indicate that outsider-rich boards improved firm performance when they worked with top managers imported from outside the focal industry. On the other hand, a high proportion of outsiders on the board and top managers imported from the focal industry were not a desirable combination for firm performance. The findings imply that researchers and practitioners should pay more attention to identifying the conditions under which board competence aligns with top management. (c) eContent Management Pty Ltd.

Representation of women on boards is getting more and more attention these recent years (Hillman, Shropshire, & Cannella, 2007; Nielsen & Huse, 2010), all the more as recent influence by the legislator accelerates the pace of change. Indeed, in France, a new law adopted in January 2011 stated that the proportion of female directors should not be lower than 40% in all major companies. Most previous research focused on the impact of the presence of women in boards on performance, but there are few studies on female directors' networks. In order to help to better understand the ties at the origin of these networks, we study several characteristics and network ties of female directors of French companies belonging to the SBF 120 index and we compare them with male characteristics. We test the specificity of four types of board of directors' networks: attendance at the same elite educational institutions, use of business networks, civil servants' networks, and interlocking directorates.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: In this study, we investigated the effects of several factors related to nominating and compensation committee structure and process on the likelihood of employing backdated stock options. Research Findings/Insights: To test our hypotheses, we selected a sample of US firms that had been investigated for backdating stock options and a control group of similar sized US firms from the same industry that had not been investigated for backdating. Using an agency perspective, we found that when compared to companies within the same industries, firms using backdated stock options did not tend to utilize nominating committees, and structured their compensation committees so that they are smaller, and meet less frequently. We also found that their CEOs are more generously compensated. Consistent with agency theory, these findings indicate that companies using backdated stock option may possess compromised monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Despite being one of the most dominant management theories in recent history, little empirical evidence supports the validity of agency theory. In contrast to studies producing results calling into question the value of agency theory, we found significant results with regard to understanding the conditions under which agency problems might be promulgated. Also, our study contributes to the understanding of corporate governance by examining a variety of possible antecedents to the practice of backdated stock options and how boards and committees may be constructed to more effectively reduce the agency problem. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results provide important evidence concerning factors or situations associated with backdating, which will be instructive in designing remedies to curb such practices in the future. In particular, to reduce the likelihood of dating schemes such as backdated stock options, firms should consider utilizing nominating committees, and constructing committees with more members and requiring frequent meetings so that directors can be better positioned for the effective execution of their monitoring responsibilities of management.

This paper examines the role of corporate governance in non-profit sport organizations. Governance within the traditional business environment is a crucial issue for the ultimate success or failures of an entity. This study analyses if the structures and systems of governance within traditional business can be transferred to a sport organization. The various governance theories are examined to assess their applicability within a sport organization and the role of the board is also analyzed within the study. Finally, this paper examines areas of conflict which may arise relating to governance and concludes by offering a best practice approach to this integral issue within any modern sport organization.

How does a board of directors decide what is right? The contest over this question is frequently framed as a debate between shareholder value and stakeholder rights, between a utilitarian view of the ethics of corporate governance and a deontological one. This paper uses a case study with special circumstances that allows us to examine in an unusually clear way the conflict between shareholder value and other bases on which a board can act. In the autumn of 2010, the board of Liverpool Football Club sold the company to another investing group against the explicit wishes of the owners. The peculiar circumstances of this case provide insight into the conflict between ethical approaches to board decisions, allowing us to see certain issues more clearly than we can in listed corporations with many shareholders. What the analysis suggests is that the board saw more than one type of utility on which to base its ethical decision, and that one version resonated with perceived duties to stakeholders. This alignment of outcomes of strategic value with duties contrasted with the utility of shareholder value. While there are reasons to be cautious in generalizing, the case further suggests reasons why boards may reject shareholder value, in opposition to mainstream notions of corporate governance, without rejecting utility as a base of their decisions. Further, the partial alignment of duty and utility facilitates a pragmatic decision rather than one based on a priori claims. (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Social activists and government agencies seek greater diversity on corporate boards without any considerations of firm or governance characteristics. Using a comprehensive dataset on over 8000 firms from 1996 through 2005, we explore the potential determinants of socially homogeneous boards based on the advisory and monitoring needs of a firm. We find that director-homogeneity is associated with lower advertising intensity, lower R&D intensity but greater firm risk. Director-homogeneity is also positively associated with measures of CEO influence such as CEO ownership, CEO tenure, non-independence of nominating committee and director ownership. Overall, the empirical evidence implies that firms choose social diversity on the board of directors based on the economic needs and existing governance structures. (c) 2018, SAGE Publications Ltd.

This study focuses on the role of corporate political resources in shaping firm strategy in an extension of resource dependence theory. Using a sample of 92 regional banks for the period 1997-2004 in Japan, this paper explores the effect of amakudari (translated as the appointment of former bureaucrats to the boards of directors of private organizations) on the performance and managerial risk-taking of banks. We found that amakudari networks have a negative impact on a bank's profitability in the post-bubble crisis era when firm-specific and other variables are controlled. In addition, the evidence shows that a bank appointing more ex-bureaucrats to its board of directors has a tendency to get involved in more risky lending activities. Furthermore, the empirical results of this study are also found to be robust using the Arellano-Bond GMM estimator.

This chapter considers the legitimacy of shareholder (also known as investor) activism as a means of exercising influence in the corporate decision-making process and identifies engaged boards as a superior solution to addressing issues that activists attempt to address. Drawing on ideas from multiple principal agency theory, the board of directors' wider role is conceptualized as representing the common interests of multiple principals who have both common and divergent interests. When any one principal is able to serve its own interests by influencing corporate decision-making through shareholder/ investor activism, other principals' interests may be compromised. A set of initiatives available to boards is suggested that focuses on the social dimension of their strategic governance role in mediating among multiple stakeholders to address their concerns while at the same time working towards the long-term sustainability of the business. The chapter highlights the application of multiple principal agency theory to the context of corporate governance, along with other concepts relating to the social dimension and the emerging relational perspective on board competence. From these perspectives it is proposed that the board takes a proactive role in leading this type of engagement, while at the same time recognizing that directors will need better relational skills than has traditionally been expected of them in fulfilling their fiduciary responsibilities.

This study addresses the call for the development of team effectiveness scales that take team context into account. It develops and validates a measurement scale for effectiveness in the specific context of boards of directors in family firms.
Results from a validation study based on 90 family businesses indicate that even if board task performance is associated with activities and roles that appear to represent differing views of effectiveness, they share a single, common line of inquiry. Moreover the study confirms that boards can be distinguished according to the degree to which they perceive themselves as more or less effective in performing certain roles. The scale demonstrates diagnostic properties that make it useful for practitioners as well as researchers. (c) 2012 Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

Board composition is a critical element in the ability of the board to impact firm outcomes. While much of this research has focused on size and independence, there is growing literature that investigates the composition of directors' demography, human capital, and social capital. The purpose of this article is to synthesize this diverse literature. The authors first review the literature on board demographics, human capital, and social capital composition research. In doing so, they highlight the theoretical and methodological approaches utilized. Finally, they suggest avenues for future research that can advance our understanding of the effects of board composition. (c) The Author(s) 2013.

Although the composition of the board of directors has important implications for different aspects of firm performance, prior studies tend to focus on financial performance. The effects of board composition on corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance remain an under-researched area, particularly in the period following the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). This article specifically examines two important aspects of board composition (i.e., the presence of outside directors and the presence of women directors) and their relationship with CSR performance in the Post-SOX era. With data covering over 500 of the largest companies listed on the U.S. stock exchanges and spanning 64 different industries, we find empirical evidence showing that greater presence of outside and women directors is linked to better CSR performance within a firm's industry. Treating CSR performance as the reflection of a firm's moral legitimacy, our study suggests that deliberate structuring of corporate boards may be an effective approach to enhance a firm's moral legitimacy.

We develop a contingency approach to explain how firm ownership influences the monitoring function of the board - measured as the magnitude of external audit fees contracted by the board - by extending agency theory to incorporate the resource dependence notion that boards have distinct incentives and abilities to monitor management. Analyses of data on Continental European companies reveal that while board independence and audit services are complementary when ownership is dispersed, this is not the case when ownership is concentrated - suggesting that ownership concentration and board composition become substitutes in terms of monitoring management. Additional analysis shows that the relationship between board composition and external audit fees is also contingent upon the type of the controlling shareholder.

In this article, we examine the factors determining the representation of women on boards of directors by considering three main questions. The first question deals with the relationship between characteristics of ownership and governance on one side, and female directorship on the other. The second major question concerns the demographic attributes of women directors, such as nationality, foreign experience, educational level, business expertise, and connections to external sources. The third important question refers to women in senior positions on French boards (e.g., as independent members or board subcommittee members) in relation to firm characteristics and women's demographic attributes. Our study focuses on French large- and mid-capitalized companies belonging to the SBF120 stock market index during a 5-year period running from 2000 to 2004. First, our results give evidence that the appointment of women directors is strongly related to family ownership and board or firm size. Second, the appointment of women directors is related to their professional services, valuable skills, and network links. Furthermore, we show that women face a double glass-ceiling problem, and note that French firms rely more on the demographic attributes of their women directors when they are appointed to senior board positions. Our study sheds light on issues concerning the law that comes into force in 2016, which imposes quotas of women members on boards of directors in French companies.

This study investigates the joint effect of corporate ownership and board of directors' diversity configurations on the success of strategic merger and acquisition (M&A) decisions. Board diversity is defined as the extent to which its demographic diversity as measured by the culture, nationality, gender and experience of its directors complements its statutory diversity. A theoretical framework linking ownership, board diversity and M&A strategic decision making is proposed and tested. Based on a sample of 289 M&A decisions undertaken by Canadian firms over the period 2000-2007, demographic diversity is found to have a clear and non-linear effect on M&A performance while statutory diversity is of limited influence. Ownership is found to influence the effect of diversity, making the relation finer and more precise. This has practical implications. First, statutory diversity is not sufficient for well-performing boards. Also, ownership is an important factor. The most advocated board diversity aimed at insuring the board's independence is not valid across all ownership configurations. From a public policy perspective, results provide support for the principles-based approach in governance. Governance regimes should encourage the search for a balance between board diversity and the need for cohesion that best serves the firm's purpose and obligations. (c) 2011 The Author(s).

This study asserts that the effects of board characteristics on firm innovation need to be evaluated with reference to contingency variables. A literature review suggests that relatively few studies adopt a contingency view when examining the outcomes of boards of directors. This study examines the influence on firm innovation of characteristics such as board size, outsider ratio and board diversity, and suggests that their influence is contingent upon firm size. The model is tested on a sample of Italian companies and finds support for the contingency hypothesis. This study advances research on boards of directors by emphasizing the importance of context.

In this article, we use a sample of Norwegian quoted companies in the period of 2001-2010 to explore whether the gender quota requiring 40 % female directors on corporate boards changes the likelihood of women being appointed to top leadership roles as board chairs or corporate CEOs. Our empirical results indicate that the gender quota and the resulting increased representation of female directors provide a fertile ground for women to take top leadership positions. The presence of female board chairs is positively associated with female directors' independence status, age and qualification, whilst the presence of female CEOs is positively related to the average qualification of female directors. Firms with older and better educated female directors are more likely to appoint female board chairs. The likelihood of female CEOs' appointment increases with the percentage of independent directors and directors' qualifications, especially those for female directors. Furthermore, the gender gaps with respect to qualification, board interlocks and nationality between female and male board chairs vanishes after Norwegian companies' full compliance to the quota in January 2008. However, the gender quota has no significant impact on the gender gaps between female and male directors after its full compliance. Our article thereby contributes to understanding how gender quotas, presence of female directors, percentage of female directors on boards and other board characteristics can determine the gender of top leaders of organizations.

This study investigates how a fundamental group decision-making bias referred to as group polarization can influence boards' acquisition premium decisions. The theory suggests that when prior premium experience would lead directors on average to support a relatively high premium prior to board discussions, they will support a focal premium that is even higher after discussions; but when directors' prior premium experience would lead them on average to support a relatively low premium prior to board discussions, they will support a focal premium that is even lower after discussions. Results provided strong support for the theory. Moreover, group polarization was reduced by demographic homogeneity among directors and by minority expertise but increased by board influence. This study introduces a fundamental group decision-making bias into governance research and explains how group processes can influence network diffusions. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Board diversity is important especially in countries which practice a one-tier board system, such as Malaysia. Under the system, board appointments are usually controlled by the firm's substantial shareholders, and as a result, directors are chosen based on "the old-boy" network or "people like us", who are typically middle-aged males and from similar ethnicity which could lead to "group think". Board diversity ensures breadth and depth of the board's judgments. To this end, this study examines board diversity of the top 100 non-financial Malaysian firms, specifically directors' gender, ethnicity and age and their effects on firm performance. Data are collected from the 2007 annual reports of the sample firms. The evidence indicates the lack of diversity of the Malaysian boards of directors. Results from the multivariate analyses reveal that gender diversity is negatively associated with Tobin's q and ROA. Age diversity is found to be negatively related to ROA. Ethnic diversity, on the other hand, is found to be positively associated with ROA. Hence, findings on the effect of board diversity and firm performance are mixed. Nevertheless, this study offers insights to policy makers in enhancing corporate governance in Malaysia where diversity is one of the areas that could strengthen the effectiveness of the board.

Much of the scholarship on boards of directors has examined either the control (i.e., monitoring) role or the resource dependence role that boards fill. Relatively little has examined the service role, wherein directors provide advice and guidance to management. This study builds on recent work exploring director expertise by asking how operational expertise on boards impacts firm performance. We find that having external COO/presidents on a board of directors positively impacts firm performance when the firm's operational efficiency is declining, but negatively impacts performance when the firm's operational efficiency is improving. We also find that other types of external executives serving as directors exhibit the opposite relationship, suggesting that the value of director expertise is context-dependent. We discuss the implications of these findings for director selection. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper investigates the impact of diversity on corporate philanthropy. Compared to previous studies that have considered the influence of board diversity and CEO gender on corporate philanthropy, this study introduces the concept of operational diversity, which is the implementation of diversity programs at management, employee, and supply chain levels, and further, it explains why operational diversity influences corporate philanthropy, by using the premises of resource dependence theory. Second, this study also investigates the influence of board diversity on corporate philanthropy. Third, this study uses a large sample of U.S. firms over the period of 1991-2009 and tries to mitigate possible omitted variables and endogeneity problems that are often overlooked in previous research. We demonstrate that firms with operational diversity programs are likely more dependent on a broad variety of resources and give more to community as a strategic maneuver; hence, operational diversity is a better indicator for predicting future corporate giving than board diversity alone. However, having a woman or a member of a minority as a company's chief executive officer is not sufficient to impact its charitable giving. A battery of robustness tests support our conclusion and confirm that our results are not driven by a firm's general corporate social responsibility (CSR) score, gender or independence of board members, or firm ownership. This paper will assist researchers, practitioners, and other stakeholders in deepening their understanding of the predictors of corporate giving. (c) 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

This study examined the association between corporate transparency and ethical orientation of Fortune 500 companies and the number of females represented on the board of directors from the Fortune (2010) annual report data. Our basis for this judgment was whether the firm was listed on either (both) Ethisphere Magazine's "2010 World's Most Ethical Companies" (Ethisphere Magazine 2011) or (and) Corporate Responsibility Magazine's "100 Best Corporate Citizens 2010" (Corporate Responsibility Magazine 2011) list(s). Our results indicated that, as the number of women directors increased, the probability of a corporation appearing on these lists increased. We also found that a ''critical mass'' of women directors was indicated by the data for Ethisphere Magazine's but not Corporate Responsibility Magazine's list.

This study draws from the corporate governance literature to investigate the implications of board involvement for international joint ventures (IJVs). We extend recent corporate governance research on the value of board involvement by investigating unique sources of complexity related to the nature of the IJV. We argue and find that board involvement can enhance the performance of IJVs, particularly for collaborations that are complex in nature due to their broad functional scope as well the level of market overlap between IJV parents. We complement recent research on joint venture control that has focused on the antecedents and types of control, as well as studies on formal (e.g. contractual safeguards and monitoring) and informal governance mechanisms (e.g. trust) by providing empirical evidence that IJV board involvement is valuable when directors undertake their control and coordination responsibilities. We advance corporate governance research by providing evidence that joint ventures possess several unique characteristics that shape the value of board involvement, thereby showing that applications of corporate governance theory to joint ventures are useful, but should be made with care.

In this paper we develop and test a theoretical model that reduces relational risks to solve the puzzle of conflicting task requirements imposed on boards of directors in listed companies. Doing so unites two seemingly conflicting tasks-board control and service tasks-through examining relational risks between the board and the CEO. We also present two mechanisms that could reduce relational risks. One is board power over the CEO, and the other board trust in the CEO. Practitioners could apply these two mechanisms to achieve better performance of board control and service tasks simultaneously. We test hypotheses using 441 survey responses collected in 2005. The result shows a good fit between the model and survey data, indicating examining relational risks is a rewarding approach to understanding conflicting board task performance, and board control over the CEO and board trust in the CEO are two effective mechanisms to reduce relational risks.

This paper reports on the interaction of compositional effects of boards of directors (BoD) and top management teams (TMTs) on firms' financial performance. Composition of both groups is investigated for cultural, age, tenure and gender diversity. We explore effects of demographic diversity in the two power groups on performance in interaction with each other by bringing in the similarity-attraction paradigm to argue for the relationship. Study data are from consolidated financial statements in annual reports of listed Swedish corporations. Our findings suggest that while differences in gender, age and tenure diversities have no effect on firm performance, close alignment of cultural diversities of the BoD and TMT does have a positive effect of firm performance.

This study focuses on the role of the corporate board of directors and the relationship between the dynamics of board structure and the financial performance of listed South African companies. The research results found that the proportion of independent non-executive directors had a significant positive effect on firm performance as measured by earnings per share and enterprise value, but had no significant effect on Tobin's Q ratio. Board ownership had a significant negative correlation with firm performance as measured by earnings per share, enterprise value and Tobin's Q ratio. The number of directors serving on the corporate board had a significant positive effect on firm performance as measured by earnings per share, enterprise value and Tobin's Q ratio. The study suggests that greater independent non-executive director representation, lower board share-ownership and larger board sizes should be encouraged to enhance firm performance.

Using a large sample analysis of Thai listed firms, we address an important question. Do board diversity and network add value to firms? This article extends the debate on the benefits and costs of board diversity and network and their effect on the broader picture of corporate governance. The sample period straddles 2001 to 2005, which allows us to examine board characteristics in response to the Asian financial crisis. We find that diversity in age and study majors are positively related to Tobin's Q ratio, while diversity in educational levels leads to lower firm value. Our results suggest that boards with diverse age groups and study areas might generate useful advice and complement each other; however, those with diverse educational levels might create costs due to possible conflicts and a lack of coordination and communication. In addition, the results show that alumni networks have a positive effect on Tobin's Q ratio. The findings further suggest that board networks could bring benefits to firms. An alumni network is significant to firms because it could help firms obtain external resources. It also provides significant findings for policy makers to design best practices of directors in emerging countries. (c) author(s) Creative Commons License CC-BY.

By integrating agency, stewardship and resource-dependency perspectives, this paper associated three characteristics of the board of directors - outside directors, insiders' equity ownership and leadership duality (Executive Officer also being the Chairman of the Board) - with bank's financial performance in Lebanon. Using a panel model, and after controlling for endogeneity problems, we examined 54 listed and unlisted banks from 2005 to 2010. Our results implied that the presence of outside directors on the board and the leadership duality have no statistical impact on performance. It seems that severe regulations by the Lebanese monetary authority act as an external governance mechanism. On the contrary, insiders' ownership promotes convergence of the interests of managers/shareholders and shapes the performance of banks. Our findings may well urge Lebanese bankers and regulators towards further development and implementation of governance practices to enhance the performance and the stability of one of the pillars of the Lebanese economy.

The purpose of this paper is to explore and verify roles of boards as bundle of tasks in the context of SMEs in a small country. This is a descriptive study based on the perceptions of CEOs. The objective was to find empirical evidence for what boards in small and medium sized companies perceive they do in terms of tasks and roles. A survey was sent out to 560 SMEs in Iceland and the response rate was 21%. Factor analysis shows that three different roles can be measured in SMEs: Monitoring role, Strategic role and Resource and Advice role. The results of this research show that boards in SMEs can and do have more than one role and are more active in strategy than often is assumed. (c) 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The interlocking board directorships among corporations. as well as between corporations and social organizations, is important for defining the modern political economy. This article finds the networks of those interlocks for Koch Industries Inc. and TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation. Moreover, the article extends the networks to describe and analyze the accompanying political network of contributions to Nebraska political campaigns. For corporate and social networks, we utilize conventional theoretical structures to find the new database of those networks for Koch Industries and TD Ameritrade. The new theoretical structure and database concern the campaign contributions of the board of directors in the corporate and social networks, as we trace them to campaigns for federal offices. The new political campaign finance structure we uncover here includes thousands of interconnected campaign finance conduits, through which money flows to political campaigns.

The recent systemic crisis that has affected the financial markets and real economies of major industrialized countries has had significant effects on the corporate governance and key organizational choices of large firms. In this context, the present study aims to verify whether the international crisis has significantly changed the structure of the interlocking directorate network that links large firms in the regulated Italian market. To this end, the first part of the paper presents an analysis of the evolution of corporate governance in the main European regulated markets through a comparative analysis of some synthetic statistical data observed at the end of the years 2006, 2008 and 2010. In the second part, after framing the concept of interlocking directorate in a theoretical perspective, we examine the evolution of the network of personal ties between large Italian listed companies in the period of observation (2006-2010) using Social Network Analysis.

The main purpose of this study is to develop and examine the theoretical model of hospital governance. For this purpose, this study integrates the literature of organizational governance and agency theory to empirically test the relationship between hospital governance mechanisms (structure of board of directors, information disclosure, and decision making) and hospital governance effectiveness (financial, customer, internal process, learning and growth, and social responsibility). This study empirically tested hospital governance related indices from 102 hospitals by using secondary data. The results find that (1) information disclosure and decision making of hospital governance mechanisms are positively related to its governance effectiveness, and (2) the relationship between the structures of board of directors and its governance effectiveness is non-significant. The theoretical and managerial implications and suggestions of future study are provided at the end of this study.

In this study, we investigated the impact of academicians as board members on firm outcomes. Based on popular theories of corporate governance, we contend that firms with academicians as directors would have more vigilance on their boards, would perform better based on accounting measures, and would be perceived as more valuable based on a market measure. Using a matched-pair design, our results showed that firms with academician directors do not have more vigilance on their boards and do not differ based on their accounting performance. However, they are perceived to be more valuable, which signifies the possible positive impact of academicians on one of the organizational outcomes. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. (c) The Authors 2013.

The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between board composition and financial vulnerability of non-profit organizations in Malaysia. Information on these variables is obtained from the content analysis of annual reports of 205 societies registered with Registrar of Societies in Malaysia for the financial period 2010. Results of this study revealed significant relationships between some board compositions and some measures of financial vulnerabilities. First, there is a significant positive relationship between board members with professional affiliations and solvency. Second, there is a negative relationship between board members with political connections and efficiency as well as solvency. These findings indicate that types of directors on the board are important as they bring specific critical resources to match the specific environmental needs facing the organizations. In addition, the findings also provide useful information that can facilitate screening, monitoring, and decision making processes for various stakeholders.

Marta Cuadrado This study advances research on CEO succession and board monitoring of senior executives by examining how proprietary directors can affect the probability of CEO dismissal. Drawing on our newly developed database covering all CEO successions occurring in all Spanish listed firms during the period 2007-2010, we propose that proprietary directors may increase the board's monitoring efforts over the chief executive, forcing him to resign in situations of poor performance. Hypotheses are tested longitudinally, using CEO succession data taken from 111 publicly-traded firms in the Spanish mercado continuo' over a four-year period.

We investigate the effect of corporate sustainability on organizational processes and performance. Using a matched sample of 180 U.S. companies, we find that corporations that voluntarily adopted sustainability policies by 1993 - termed as high sustainability companies - exhibit by 2009 distinct organizational processes compared to a matched sample of companies that adopted almost none of these policies - termed as low sustainability companies. The boards of directors of high sustainability companies are more likely to be formally responsible for sustainability, and top executive compensation incentives are more likely to be a function of sustainability metrics. High sustainability companies are more likely to have established processes for stakeholder engagement, to be more long-term oriented, and to exhibit higher measurement and disclosure of nonfinancial information. Finally, high sustainability companies significantly outperform their counterparts over the long term, both in terms of stock market and accounting performance. (c) 2014 INFORMS.

Diverse boards have been seen as providing impetus for initiating change. However, diversity may introduce conflict and impede decision making, which could hinder the ability of the firm to make strategic change, especially in times when firm performance is low. Integrating threat-rigidity theory and team diversity research, we examine how board gender diversity, firm performance, and the power of women directors interact to influence the amount of strategic change. Results support a three-way interaction, indicating that when the board is not experiencing a threat as a result of low firm performance and women directors have greater power, the relationship between board gender diversity and amount of strategic change is the most positive. However, when the board is threatened by low firm performance and women directors have greater power, the relationship between board gender diversity and amount of strategic change is the most negative. Results suggest that diversity is double-edged because it can propel or impede strategic change depending on firm performance and the power of women directors.

Divergent views exist about whether boards must tradeoff advising for monitoring performance when utilizing outside versus inside directors. We suggest a dichotomous tradeoff focus underestimates outside directors[U+05F3] impact on board performance. We find outside director tenure positively associated with firm acquisition/investment policy advising performance and CEO compensation monitoring performance, suggesting that advising and monitoring do not always compete for directors[U+05F3] time. However, tenure is not a panacea - it marginally weakens financial reporting monitoring performance which is instead enhanced by outside directors[U+05F3] financial expertise. Overall, the results suggest outside director tenure and diverse expertise support both advising and monitoring performance. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Building on corporate governance research and institutional theory, this paper explores interrelationships between the firm's corporate governance, responsible leadership, and corporate social responsibility approaches in different institutional contexts. We present a critique of corporate governance research grounded in agency theory with its focus on corporate social responsibility as mere compliance with rules and regulations. We link different leadership orientations and corporate social responsibility approaches to two key process dimensions of corporate governance related to monitoring and incentives. This analysis builds on previous research that differentiates between governance mechanisms based on strategic as opposed to financial controls and explains how these types of control may be related to responsible managerial behavior and the firm's corporate social responsibility strategies. Building on governance studies grounded in sociology and organizational theory, we further argue that links between corporate social responsibility strategies and corporate governance factors such as boards of directors, ownership patterns, and executive incentives may differ depending on the legal system and institutional characteristics in a specific country. Our discussion suggests that researchers need to develop a more holistic, institutionally embedded governance framework to analyze organizational approaches to corporate social responsibility.

Research on human capital as a source of competitive advantage has focused largely on firm employees. In this article, we argue that outside directors' general human capital can also be a source of competitive advantage. Firm performance is likely to benefit from directors' human capital-that is, their prior experience and education-because such human capital is likely to make them more effective at monitoring management and providing advice. Drawing on insights from research on individuals' cognitive limitations, we further argue that the extent to which the firm is able to benefit from this human capital can be severely limited by the demands for information processing that directors face from their other board positions. Consequently, we find that the benefit of directors' human capital is contingent upon the information processing load placed upon them from their other board appointments. We find support for our hypotheses using data on over 5,700 directors from 650 firms sampled from the Fortune 1000. This study extends the nascent literature on board human capital by showing that in addition to specific expertise in relevant areas, directors' general human capital can also help firms create competitive advantage. The theory developed in this article also contributes to the literature on strategic human capital by incorporating the concept of information processing demands, suggesting that not only do such demands leave limited cognitive capacity for directors to focus on the focal firm but also that they can severely diminish the beneficial effects of directors' general human capital.

This paper contributes to the corporate governance literature by developing and testing theory regarding positive and negative synergies between the CEO's and the board's human and social capital. Using a sample of 360 biotechnology firms that went public between 1995 and 2010, we demonstrate that accumulated public company board experiences of the CEO and the board have positive synergistic effects on IPO performance whereas the current board appointments have negative effects. While scientific educational backgrounds have positive synergies, industry-specific experiences produce either positive or counterproductive effects depending on the age and profitability of the firm. Thus, our paper contributes to the corporate governance and human and social capital literatures by describing the costs and benefits of specific types and combinations of CEO and board capital.

Manuscript Type: Conceptual Research Questions/Issues: We explore why and how the different combinations of governance practices at national level, such as the legal system, conduct codes, and capital markets, and at firm level, such as various types of controlling shareholders, enable or constrain outside directors to engage in their monitoring and resource provision roles. Building upon such analysis, we develop a new taxonomy of corporate governance systems according to the different configurations of a set of interdependent governance characteristics, including national governance mechanisms, identity of block shareholders, and functions of outside directors. Research Insights: This study enriches the growing body of research on governance complementarity and substitution by highlighting the role of bundles of governance practices in influencing directors' engagement in governance behavior, and consequently advancing our understanding of variation in corporate governance systems across and within countries. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This paper demonstrates that the roles of outside directors depend on the interaction between a bundle of governance mechanisms rather than any individual mechanisms. The paper also goes beyond the traditional governance models based on the national context and highlights that interdependencies of corporate governance practices play an important role in explaining the diversity and variation of corporate governance arrangements across firms in both industrialized economies and emerging markets. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This paper provides insights to policymakers by suggesting that not all the governance bundles are conducive to managerial monitoring and resource provision by outside directors.

This paper develops relational pluralism as a collective construct whose dimensions are heterogeneity, multiplexity, and asymmetry. Relational pluralism is instantiated in the board of directors, whose network of relationships influence a new venture's ability to establish external links beyond the networks of the founding team. We argue that relational pluralism speeds the establishment of a diverse alliance portfolio, which, in turn, speeds the attainment of major revenue milestones in a new firm. We examine these ideas in a population of de novo semiconductor firms and find that diverse alliance portfolios emerge faster when a board includes members with heterogeneous, multiplex relationships, as well as central network positions. However, the asymmetric influence of outside board members can have both positive and negative effects: the alliance formation process is aided by outsiders in central network positions, but impeded when central investors dominate the board. We discuss implications for our understanding of relational pluralism as a collective construct. (c) Academy of Management Journal.

In this paper, it is argued that boards internationalize by recruiting international directors in order to increase companies' performance. However, increasing nationality diversity on a board can be costly considering that it potentially creates cooperative problems on a board due to fault-lines and separation processes. As a result, boards will prefer international candidates who are more similar to themselves on a variety of 'distances'. Based on data collected regarding 5683 board members of 361 companies from 15 countries in 2005-2007, we discover that the greater the distance (cultural, institutional and geographical) between the candidates' and the companies' country-of-origin, the lower the fraction of board members of that nationality on boards. Subsequently, it is argued that historical ties between countries play a 'distance compressing' role and partially compensate for the effects of distance. A colonial tie between countries will make recruitment of these particular nationalities more likely than others. (c) 2013.

Our research aims at exploring individual's characteristics of women on Boards in the French context. In the first part of our paper, we discuss the different theoretical frameworks which supported the business case of gender diversity on Boards of Directors and expose our hypothesis regarding differences in women and men characteristics. The second part presents our methods, measurements and data. Then, we focus on our empirical study. Our sample consists of the French Index SBF 120 companies. We studied the profile of 1,250 directors collecting information from the firms' annual reports of year 2010, using various scales defined by previous research on that field in the Anglo-Saxon literature. Our findings confirm that integrating women on boards has an impact on the Human and Social Capital of Boards but not as much as might have been expected. It is worth noting that men and women board members seem to build their human and social capital through the same educational process in France. Nonetheless, our work shows significant differences between men and women regarding professional experience and board member status. (c) by author(s); CC-BY.

Purpose: This study aims to open up the black box of the boardroom by directly observing directors' interactions during meetings to better understand board processes.
Design/methodology/approach: We analyze videotaped observations of board meetings at two Australian companies to develop insights into what directors do in meetings and how they participate in decision-making processes. The direct observations are triangulated with semi-structured interviews, mini-surveys and document reviews.
Findings: Our analyses lead to two key fndings: while board meetings appear similar at a surface level, boardroom interactions vary significantly at a deeper level (i.e. board members participate differently during different stages of discussions), and factors at multiple levels of analysis explain differences in interaction patterns, revealing the complex and nested nature of boardroom discussions.
Research implications: Bydocumenting significant intra- and inter-board meeting differences, our study challenges the widespread notion of board meetings as rather homogeneous and monolithic, points towards agenda items as a new unit of analysis and highlights the need for more multi-level analyses in a board setting.
Practical implications: While policymakers have been largely occupied with the "right" board composition, our findings suggest that decision outcomes or roles' execution could be potentially affected by interactions at a board level. Differences in board meeting styles might explain prior ambiguous board structure-performance results, enhancing the need for greater normative consideration of how boards do their work.
Originality/value: This study complements existing research on boardroom dynamics and provides a systematic account of director interactions during board meetings. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Integrating risk, gender diversity and upper echelons literatures, we examine whether the presence of women in upper management (top management team (TMT) and board of directors (BOD)) and the tenure of TMTs and BODs are associated with the risk of lawsuits. An analysis of data from firms in the US retail industry shows that the presence of women in TMTs and BODs and the tenure of TMTs and BODs are negatively associated with legal risk, but longer tenured BODs with more women had a positive impact on lawsuits. Implications and suggestions for future research are offered. (c) 2012 British Academy of Management.

Chief information officers (CIOs) play increasingly strategic roles in firms in this competitive global economy, which is now largely powered by information technology (IT). However, research has shown a lack of board of directors' oversight on CIO- and IT-related issues. Drawing on agency, resource dependence, and alignment theories, we investigate the effect of board of directors' IT awareness on CIO compensation structure and firm performance. We conduct cross-sectional time series analyses of data collected from various sources. Our study underlines three important findings. First, we show that some commonly known executive compensation determinants, such as individual characteristics and governance structure, do not have significant effects on CIO compensation structure. Second, with regard to CIO compensation structure, firms respond to increasing information asymmetry differently according to the level of IT awareness of their boards. Finally, firms perform better when their boards have higher levels of IT awareness, and this positive effect of IT awareness is considerably larger in IT intensive industries. Overall, our study provides empirical support for the important role of boards' IT awareness in shaping CIO compensation and improving firm performance. Our results suggest that boards with functional area knowledge-or higher IT awareness in this case-can more effectively monitor and better incentivize executives, and consequently lead to better firm performance.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study examines whether certain proxies for board incentives and board capital are linked with bankruptcy in unlisted firms. Research Findings/Insights: Based on data analyzed over a five-year period with a sample of 232 matched pairs of unlisted firms, results reveal that firms with boards led by an independent Board Chair (vs. CEO duality), and including longer-tenured directors, and directors with fewer additional directorships on average, are less likely to become bankrupt. Results of analyses of board size and board change support a "reputation" hypothesis, i.e. that directors begin to flee firms in a downward spiral prior to bankruptcy. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Results support an eclectic model of board incentives and board capital, which integrates elements of agency and resource dependence theories, and the group decision-making literature to explain governance antecedents of firms that went bankrupt. It builds on a model proposed by Hillman and Dalziel, while identifying important differences, including lack of support for predicted moderating effects between board incentives and board capital. Findings also support applicability of the threat-rigidity logic and reputation hypothesis in this context, and the importance of anchoring corporate governance research more precisely on prediction of certain levels of performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Findings support governance recommendations to separate Board Chair and CEO leadership and limit a director's number of outside directorships. Negative effects of director tenure on bankruptcy contradict the notion of "term limits," suggesting that benefits of firm-specific knowledge and experience may outweigh risks of entrenchment.

Research on the composition of the board of directors of DMOs as well as the governance of DMOs is of particular interest for destination management, because it helps understand the context of community-type tourist destinations. There is an increasing body of research on the composition and roles of DMO boards of directors as well as the duties and tasks of those individuals. However, to date, no study has addressed their influence on the financial revenues of the organization. A DMO's budget is not God-given but evolves along with the development of the organizations and the institutions in the destinations. Thus, we investigate to what extent directors on the boards affect the amount from different revenue sources. Using data from 44 Swiss local and regional DMOs, we perform seven distinct multiple regressions with the following revenue sources as dependent variables: (1) membership fees, (2) partnership platforms/initiatives, (3) commercial revenues, (4) overnight taxes, (5) regional and state subsidies, (6) municipal subsidies, and (7) tourism taxes. Four independent variables (1) stakeholders, (2) public agents, (3) leaders, and (4) networkers, positively and negatively affect the revenue sources. The results reveal two contrasting roles: while leaders and networkers likely increase the revenue sources, stakeholder representatives and public agents negatively affect the revenue sources. Additionally, the latter two functions strongly increase the size of the DMOs' boards. We conclude with a new perspective on how to understand DMO boards, their functions, and finally the organizations themselves. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This empirical study challenges the theory that a 'critical mass' of three or more women at the boardroom table is needed to make a difference. Performance ratings of Canadian publicly traded companies by the Globe and Mail show consistently higher corporate governance scores for companies with more women on their boards of directors. However, while companies that had three or more women on their boards had the highest scores, companies with only one woman on the board scored significantly higher than those with none. There was also no relationship between the number of women on boards of directors and Corporate Knights' social responsibility ratings on a national or global basis. The size of board and the type of industry are other important factors to consider when proposing quotas for female board members. (c) 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

We particularly focus on the extent to which women directors have circumvented the glass ceiling. Using a sample of SBF 120 companies over a 10-year period from 2000 to 2009, our results provide evidence of a significant increase in the number of women on French corporate boards. However, the corporate glass ceiling hypothesis is consistently rejected whatever the considered measure of female directors; i.e., the number of board seats held by women, the number of firms with a critical mass of female directors, and the number of directorships held by each women director.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the nature of corporate governance practised by co-operatives and mutual societies in New Zealand and whether there is any relationship between co-operatives' ownership structure, capital structure and agency costs. The study also explores whether the capital structure and the ownership structure changed during the period 2005-2011. Design/methodology/approach - Panel data for the period 2005-2011 are analysed using ordinary least squares regression and the Tobit model regression. The authors have used operating expense to sales, asset utilisation and ROA as the dependent variables. Findings - The findings indicate that an increase in independent directors, board member experience and size (measured by total annual sales) reduces agency costs in co-operatives and mutuals in New Zealand. Also, borrowing from members rather than banks reduces agency cost and increases profitability in co-operatives and mutuals. Research limitations/implications - Caution should be exercised when generalising the findings of the study as it is restricted to New Zealand environment and the sample size used is relatively small. Practical implications - This study offers insights for policy makers internationally who are interested in adopting similar corporate governance practices in their own countries. Within New Zealand, the corporate governance debate associated with co-operatives and mutual societies will be better informed as a direct consequence of this research. Originality/value - This is the first study that extends the research undertaken by Ang et al. (2000) and Singh and Davidson (2003) to the cooperative and mutual business model in New Zealand.

An initial public offering (IPO) represents one of the final stages in the life of a small firm as it transitions from private to public. In this paper the experience of directors is examined to determine the extent of the role they play in ensuring a successful listing. Unique data from 122 IPOs on the Swedish Stock Exchange have been examined in a search for the effect of director experience on aftermarket performance. Specific aspects of director experience within a board, such as interlocking directorships and average tenure, are connected to the underpricing of Swedish IPOs. Contrary to expectations, no statistically significant relationship was found between long-run aftermarket performance and director experience at the time of an IPO. This suggests that the previous experience of directors, as measured in earlier studies, is less relevant to long-term aftermarket performance in Sweden compared to other countries studied in the literature review. This emphasises the importance of examining different institutional contexts. (c)2014 Australasian Accounting Business and Finance Journal and Authors.

Purpose - With boards of directors playing both monitoring and guidance roles, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of board structure on firm value in large US and UK firms using the lenses of agency and resource dependence theories. Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of firms in the USA and the UK from 2000 to 2007, the paper conducts a panel data analysis of the impact of board structure on firm value and examine the nuances of different governance environments. Findings - The paper finds distinct differences in the impact of board independence, board size, and outside director busyness on firm value between UK and US firms. Specifically, the paper finds that board independence, board size, and board busyness all have a significant positive impact on firm value in the UK. However, the paper finds no significant relationship between board independence and firm value among US firms. Both board size and board busyness are found to be positively associated with firm value in the USA. Social implications - The paper finds strong support for resource dependence theory in the UK but limited support for agency theory in the USA. Originality/value - This paper takes a multi-country approach to examining the impact of board structure on firm value. (c) 2014, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - This paper aims to understand the determinants of board structure of listed firms at institutional, industry and firm levels within an emerging economy. At the institutional level, the paper explores laws, managerial culture and the role of state in instituting and endorsing corporate governance practices. At the firm level, ownership patterns (family and non-family), experience in the capital markets, age and size of the firms are studied to find out the relation between these variables and the board structure. Design/methodology/approach - The research domain of the study is listed firms operating on the Istanbul Stock Exchange. The data for the study are collected at two phases; at the first phase, compliance reports, annual reports, articles of association and annual shareholders' meeting reports of each firm in the sample are analyzed. At the second stage, secondary data are used for understanding the dynamics of Turkish institutional context. Findings - The results of this study reveal that boards of directors of listed Turkish firms comply with the governance practices instituted by state agencies, except on issues as independent members and committees that will influence the majority owners' control domain and private benefits. Originality/value - This paper draws attention on institutional context and argues that "good governance" instruments developed for Anglo-Saxon stock market-controlled business systems provide limited explanation for an emerging economy that is characterized by close cooperation between the state, family-owned businesses and financial markets. The study offers insight to policy makers at a national level, interested in developing corporate governance principles regarding boards of directors of listed firms.

We examine the contingencies that sway independent noncore directors of S&P 500 firms to heed the norms of the corporate elite or the disciplining forces of the efficient directorial labor market in the context of executive entrenchment. We find support for the corporate elite perspective as the number of independent noncore directors is positively associated with an entrenchment index score. However, the positive association is moderated by contextual factors that influence whether these directors reflect the expectations of the corporate elite or the efficient directorial labor market. Specifically, this study shows that the association becomes more positive when these directors are highly embedded in the corporate elite network or have shorter board tenure but less positive when independent chief executive officer directors' equity ownership is high. We also found a crossover interaction effect where the association is negative (positive) when firm performance is low (high). These results shed light on an underexplored group of independent directors that play an increasing role in the effective governance of publicly listed firms. (c) 2014 INFORMS.

Purpose: This paper aims to focus on governance theories and practice variables in Not-For-Profit Service Organizations. The research answers two questions: what the prevalent governance practices of Not-for-Profit Service Organizations (NPSO) are, and whether there is a crossover among NPSO governance practices and For-Profit-Organization theories in the literature. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire to the 285 organizations within the defined parameters obtained a 18 percent response. Data were collected regarding the boards' predominant roles in the organizations' governance activities, the top executives' predominant roles in the organizations' operations and their interrelationship with the boards, and the boards' most common meeting agenda topics. Findings: The findings prove that governance models in NPSO are mostly driven by Agency Theory (52 percent of the sample). Stewardship and Resource Dependence Theories also contribute to existing governance models (28 percent), while some of the organizations have developed Hybrid Models (20 percent) drawing from the various theories. Research limitations/implications: The limited number of organizations participating in the research does not allow a generalization. However the diversity of organization types and sizes within the scope do provide a panoramic view of the not-for-profit service sector. Practical implications: Having proved that there is a crossover of governance practices among For-Profit and Not-for Profit Organizations, this research opens the door to the evaluation of many other existing or potential crossovers in governance and other management elements. Originality/value: This research is novel in its approach to look for similarities rather than differences between For-Profit and Not-for-Profit Organizations. The approach allows both sectors to learn from each other and seek for fresh improvement alternatives. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study aims to examine the relationship between multiple directorships and the monitoring role of the board of directors in Malaysian listed companies (PLC). The monitoring role is proxied by the percentage of directors' attendance in board meetings, as attending meetings provides directors with resources about the management actions and assists directors to exercise their role effectively. The study uses a sample of 1023 directors from 134 companies on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia (Malaysian Bourse) in year 2008. The results of the study show that the incidence of multiple directorships is low. Independent directors are found to have more multiple directorships. Directors with multiple directorships are older directors, have less director ownerships and are on boards with a high fraction of independent directors. Based on the 75% cut-off for the percentage of meetings' attendance, the logistic regression suggests that no agency cost is associated with multiple directorships. However, the tendency to be absent from board meetings is associated with the high number of board meetings whilst the tendency to attend more board meetings is associated with the increase in age, tenure, and director ownership.

Purpose - This study aims to investigate the nature and extent of compliance to the principle-based corporate governance initiatives by the listed companies in the South Pacific Stock Exchange (SPSE) in Fiji. Three important questions are addressed: whether listed companies in Fiji have complied with the principle-based governance practices? Did compliance with principle-based recommendations lead to an improvement in the listed company's financial performance and legitimacy? How the institutional factors have contributed towards corporate governance practices in Fiji? Design/methodology/approach - Panel data for the SPSE companies over the period 2008-2011 are analysed using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. Tobin's Q and return on assets (ROA) metrics are used as dependent variables. Findings - The findings indicate that listed companies have adopted the Capital Market Development Authority's (CMDA) recommendations by establishing subcommittees for audit and remuneration, having non-executive/independent directors on the board and separate chair and CEO positions in order to gain legitimacy from stakeholders. Results support the view that the CMDA recommendations of board sub-committees (audit and remuneration) have had positive influence on company performance measured by Tobin's Q. The findings of this study give support to the principle-based corporate governance practices adopted in Fiji to gain legitimacy. Originality/value - The study adds to the governance literature by focusing on the principle-based governance practices in a small remote island country, Fiji which has relatively small economy, capital market and company size. Finally, the study adds to institutional theory by showing how companies' corporate governance choices are affected by the severity of agency conflicts and the way corporate governance is regulated.

This study explores how new ventures access advice to achieve high growth and sustainable performance. A relational model of three important themes - compliance (regulatory and legal governance), contacts (networks of suppliers, customers, investors), and content (strategic insights) - emerged as critical to any sustainable high-growth effort. Our findings suggest that advisory boards and boards of directors have a significant role in managing and creating value for emerging high-growth firms due to inherently high failure rates, technological complexity, and market risk - all of which requires access to external resources.

Research Question/Issue: When the stock options granted to CEOs go underwater, boards of directors tend to award additional stock options to their CEOs. Drawing on agency theory and attribution theory, this study explores social psychological mechanisms that explain why boards of directors increase new option grants to CEOs in response to underwater options. Research Findings/Insights: Using the compensation data of CEOs at 966 US firms, we found that contextual factors such as market conditions and industry performance affected boards of directors' decisions to grant new stock options. Consistent with our hypotheses, boards of directors granted a greater number of new options to CEOs in response to CEOs' underwater options during the recession period than the recovery period, and they granted fewer new options when the firm's industry performance was high rather than low. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study incorporates attribution theory in understanding boards of directors' causal attribution of firm performance and its impact on executive compensation. It complements earlier studies on causal attribution by exploring the role of contextual factors. It also contributes to the research by examining the attribution process of boards of directors rather than that of top management, as well as the consequences of the causal attribution in terms of ex-post adjustment in executive option compensation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study provides up-to-date and improved evidence on boards' decision making about executive stock options. Practitioners and policy makers can benefit from the study's findings that board members rely on contextual information about the market and the competition when they make causal attribution of firm performance changes, which tends to affect their decisions about executive compensation.

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to survey chairmens perceptions of female board representation in five Nordic countries, focussing on whether the chairmans perception of board work is related to gender diversity, and on differences between high- and low-risk firms. Design/methodology/approach The authors combine data from a questionnaire directed to the chairmen of the boards in Nordic listed companieswith data on firmcharacteristics and board composition. Findings The authors find that the chairmen (97.5 percent male) are significantly less satisfied with female board members as compared to male ones. The authors also find that firms with nomination committees have more gender diverse boards, as well as indications of a more positively perceived contribution of female representation in high-risk firms. Research limitations/implications The study is restricted to perceptions of chairmen for listed Nordic firms. The low response rate of 20.1 percent is a severe limitation. Practical implications The increasing practice of using nomination committees in the Nordic countries seems advantageous from gender balance perspective. Originality/value The authors contribute to the literature on gender diversity in boards by providing results from a board intern perspective. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study investigates the effect of outside director experience on the performance of a firm's joint venture (JV) engagements, a type of strategic move where the influence of board remains under-investigated despite directors' active participation in the decision-making process. By examining the direct linkage between director experience and strategic performance, our research presents the first direct evidence of the value outside director experience has for a firm's strategic engagements; this has previously been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. We address this important issue in the following three ways. First, we explore what type of director experience contributes most to JV outcomes. Second, we investigate what circumstantial factors significantly influence the value of director experience. Lastly, we analyze whether incentive mechanisms moderate the relationship between director experience and firm performance. The results confirm the value of director experience gained from JV engagements but not from relevant industries. In addition, executive experience and the industry affiliation of the JV significantly moderate the value of director experience. Finally, experienced directors with large shareholdings outperform those with experience but limited stakes in the firms' equity, justifying the necessity to motivate directors' governance efforts despite their existing fiduciary obligation to shareholders. Our study contributes to agency theory by indicating that director experience holds a significant influence on a firm's strategic performance, an issue which has long been neglected in agency-based governance research. It also contributes to resource-dependence theory by providing a direct measurement of directors' experiential assets, which have so far been exclusively assessed by indirect indicators. Finally, findings from this study can elucidate the long-standing question of how a firm can realize the purported benefits JVs provide by introducing a vital yet rarely explored factor: board experience.

In this study, we investigated the possible moderating effects of environmental dynamism, environmental complexity, and environmental munificence on the relationships between changes in top management teams and board of directors and firm performance in the case of young entrepreneurial firms. The results showed that the three dimensions of environment do not moderate the relationship between the rate of change in top management teams and firm performance. On the other hand, the negative relationship between the rate of change in board of directors and firm performance is exacerbated by environmental complexity and munificence. The implications of these findings are discussed in the article. (c) The Authors 2014.

Drawing together literature on corporate governance, organizational behavior, and educational psychology, and using survey data from a sample of 300 Chinese company directors, this study examines the mediating role of director learning goal orientation in linking two widely-acknowledged director social identifications (identification with the organization and identification with executive-agents) and a key director task behavior, namely the monitoring of executive-agents. We also investigate the moderating role of director avoidance orientation in influencing this mediation since a predisposition to avoid loss of "face" is widely posited as having particular relevance in the Chinese context. Results show, first, that directors with stronger organizational identification monitor executive-agents more diligently than those with stronger executive-agent identification. Second, we find that while learning goal orientation mediates the positive effects of both organizational identification and executive-agent identification on monitoring, the mediated indirect effect of organizational identification on monitoring is stronger than the mediated indirect effect of executive-agent identification on monitoring. Third, results show that the indirect effects are stronger when director avoidance orientation is low. These findings underscore the importance of director social identification and learning goal orientation in inducing director monitoring in the Chinese context, as well as the worth of selecting directors who exhibit a low disposition to avoidance.

The debate around corporate governance has been particularly vigorous in this part of the 21st century. Theoretical frameworks have been tested by spectacular corporate failures that also raise questions as to the effectiveness of different approaches. Empirical, contextually-based research into how governance theory informs practice assists in understanding these questions. This paper explores findings from empirical research conducted into the make-up of boards of directors in New Zealand, an export focused economy dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises. These findings are revealing in demonstrating that despite the challenges faced by the New Zealand industry in a volatile global environment, the skill-sets and other characteristics present in, and sought from, directors appear to be both narrow and traditional. However, there is also evidence to suggest shifting expectations and requirements are to some extent and will continue to propel change in both boards and in contributions expected of individual directors.

This chapter considers the institutional environment in Russia, its potential impact upon governance practices, and the attitudes of Russian executives towards the alignment of governance processes relative to international standards. Focusing on corporate board directorship, the research addresses the extent that the harmonization of governance to international standards may assist boards of directors to improve their corporate development. Using a survey questionnaire, the authors explore perceptions of directors of public companies concerning the challenges of corporate governance development in the country. The study illustrates unanimity among the respondents about the reforms needed for international convergence of corporate governance standards. The results reveal that institutional alignment with good governance principles will foster strategic corporate development in the Russian economy. The study offers insights to policymakers in terms of enhancing legitimacy of corporate governance in the Russian context and provides a perspective for executives of foreign companies considering investment in the country.

This study investigates the valuation effect of board characteristics in corporate Joint Venture (JV) investments. Despite the prevalence of a board's involvement in JV decisions in practice, extant literature is mute concerning how the board adds value to JV outcomes. Investigation into board contribution in JVs is insightful due to executives' self-serving behaviors that may underlie their JV pursuits and boards' resource provision that may mitigate critical JV challenges. The former (latter) sheds light on the board's monitoring (advisory) role in a firm's JV engagement. Drawing on agency theory and resource dependence theory, this study investigates the value of representative board characteristics underscored by these two theoretical perspectives. Our results show that the two conventional board measures, board size and outside director ratio, do not have a significant explanatory power. In contrast, director experience associated with JV decisions and gained from within relevant industries are found to positively impact JV outcomes. Moreover, both board meeting frequency and director ownership have favorable moderating effects on the strength of the experience-value relationship. However, these two variables per se do not independently determine a JV's value. Our research results indicate the importance of taking an integrative view to the investigation of board effectiveness, a perspective which has long been neglected in board research. The findings of the present study contribute to the mixed findings of extant studies on board influence from an uninvestigated domain, JV. (c), 2014, College of Management Press. All right reserved.

This study investigates the relationship between two governance issues, i.e., ownership and board structure of Malaysian listed firms (between 2010 and 2012) and their performance in terms of profitability, liquidity and gearing. Structural Equation Modeling is applied and the data analysis tool used is Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The dependent variables used as proxies for financial performance are; profitability, liquidity and gearing, whilst the independent variables are; ownership retention (OR), board size (BS), percentage of executive directors (ED), percentage of independent directors (ID) and percentage of non-independent non-executive directors (NINED). It is conjectured that there is consistency across all components of ownership and board structure in terms of its relationship with the gearing of companies. With the exception of non-independent non-executive directors, all other components of board structure in this study seem to have an impact on the gearing of companies. In that respect, it can be concluded that a company's ownership structure and board of directors who represent the shareholders have major concerns on the gearing of companies compared to other financial indicators, as the level of gearing of a company has important and long-lasting effects on the profitability and liquidity of companies. This study leads the path for further research on all aspects of a company's gearing. (c) the author(s).

The purpose of this study is to identify the relationship between the characteristics of the board of directors and strategic change of a firm in the Chinese context. In this study, strategic change is defined as strategic deviation relative to industry norms and strategic variation relative to historical experiences. The size, independence and leadership structure of the board of directors are defined as the board characteristics. We then propose hypotheses on the effects of board characteristics on a firm's strategic change. This study takes strategic resource allocation profile as measure to calculate strategic deviation and strategic variation, and then empirically tests and verifies the hypotheses using data from Chinese publicly listed companies in the information technology industry from the year 2006 to 2010. We find that the size, independence and leadership structure of the board of directors significantly affect both strategic deviation and strategic variation. Therefore, we conclude that board characteristic affects a firm's strategic change. The conclusion of the study indicates that moderate reductions in the size of the board, increasing the proportion of independent directors and separating the roles of chairman and chief executive officer can facilitate promoting the process of strategic change for a firm in a dynamic environment. Through this study we re-examine the role and significance of the board of directors in strategic decision-making for a firm, and provide useful suggestions on how to form a board that can meet the needs for strategic change for a firm in a dynamic business environment.

We formulate theory on the effect of board of director gender diversity on the broad spectrum of securities fraud, and generate three key insights. First, based on ethicality, risk aversion, and diversity, we hypothesize that gender diversity on boards can operate as a significant moderator for the frequency of fraud. Second, we advance that the stock market response to fraud from a more gender-diverse board is significantly less pronounced. Third, we posit that women are more effective in male-dominated industries in reducing both the frequency and severity of fraud. Results of our novel empirical tests, based on data from a large sample of Chinese firms that committed securities fraud, are largely consistent with each of these hypotheses.

Ten countries have established quotas for female representation on publicly traded corporate and/or state-owned enterprise boards of directors, ranging from 33 to 50 %, with various sanctions. Fifteen other countries have introduced non-binding gender quotas in their corporate governance codes enforcing a "comply or explain" principle. Countless other countries' leaders and policy groups are in the process of debating, developing, and approving legislation around gender quotas in boards. Taken together, gender quota legislation significantly impacts the composition of boards of directors and thus the strategic direction of these publicly traded and state-owned enterprises. This article outlines an integrated model of three institutional factors that explain the establishment of board of directors gender quota legislation based on the premise that the country's institutional environment co-evolves with gender corporate policies. We argue that these three key institutional factors are female labor market and gendered welfare state provisions, left-leaning political government coalitions, and path-dependent policy initiatives for gender equality, both in the public realm as well as in the corporate domain. We discuss implications of our conceptual model and empirical findings for theory, practice, policy, and future research. These include the adoption and penalty design of board diversity practices into corporate practices, bottom-up approaches from firm to country-level gender board initiatives, hard versus soft regulation, the leading role of Norway and its isomorphic effects, the likelihood of engaging in decoupling, the role of business leaders, and the transnational and international reaction to board diversity initiatives.

Corporate governance (CG) research has largely focused on internal governance mechanisms (i.e. the board of directors, controlling owners, and managerial incentives). However, much of this work ignores the role that external CG practices play in preventing managers from engaging in activities detrimental to the welfare of shareholders, and the overall firm. In this essay, we first review and organize current research on external governance mechanisms and integrate this siloed body of work within the broader CG equation. We explicitly focus on six external governance mechanisms: the legal environment, the market for corporate control, external auditors, stakeholder activism, rating organizations, and the media. We discuss findings showing how external governance mechanisms act both as independent forces and in conjunction with internal CG mechanisms. We conclude the review by mapping an agenda for future research on CG that better integrates internal and external governance mechanisms. Our review suggests that studying different configurations of external and internal governance mechanisms will help us to better understand what factors and conditions lead to effective CG.

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is increasingly becoming a strategic issue that has to be dealt with by top management. The aim of the present study is to analyse the role that women directors can play as driving forces behind the development of CSR in organisations, and contribute to sustainable development. Despite the fact that gender diversity is acquiring considerable importance, most research has focused on analysing how it affects financial performance. In this study, we analyse the implications that gender diversity has on CSR. To do so, we have carried out an empirical study of a sample of firms from a variety of countries and sectors to determine whether those firms with a higher percentage of women on the board of directors are more socially responsible. The results support the hypothesis that gender diversity has a positive influence on CSR. Female talent can play a strategic role in enabling firms to manage their social responsibility and sustainable practices appropriately. (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

Utilising a sample of Asian firms from Hong Kong, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore, this study shows that increasing numbers of female directors on the board have a positive effect on firm performance, as measured by return on equity (ROE). However, the positive effects of gender diversity appear to be diminished in countries with higher female economic participation and empowerment. This may be due to tokenism and suggests that forcing female director appointment or mandating gender quotas can reduce firm performance in countries with strong cultural resistance.

A growing body of work suggests that the presence of women and of independent directors on boards of directors is associated with higher corporate environmental performance. However, the mechanisms linking board composition to corporate environmental performance are not well understood. This study proposes and empirically tests the mediating role of sustainability-themed alliances in the relationship between board composition and corporate environmental performance. Using the population of public oil and gas firms in the United States as the sample, the study relies on renewable energy alliances to measure sustainability-themed alliances and longitudinally analyzes lagged data for independent and control variables. The study found that (1) the higher the representation of women on a firm's board, the more likely the firm is to form sustainability-themed alliances, and (2) the higher the representation of independent directors on a firm's board, the more likely the firm is to form sustainability-themed alliances. Such alliances, in turn, positively contribute to corporate environmental performance. This paper discusses the study's contributions to the board composition-social performance literature.

We distinguish between "family companies," involving multiple family members as owners and/or managers, and "lone-founder companies," involving only the founder and no other family members. We apply social identity theory and organizational identification to elucidate the differences between these two types of firms, and how their differing organizational identities reflect unique desires for control and influence. We then consider how these differences are reflected in a firm's board structure (i.e., directorship interlocks, director experiences, and director tenures). Specifically, we predict that family firms are more likely to interlock with other family firms, select directors with more experience in family firms, and keep directors on their boards longer. Correspondingly, we posit that family firms are less likely to interlock with lone-founder firms or to select directors with experience in lone-founder-controlled firms. Lone-founder firms follow a similar pattern. We also consider the consequences of family and lone-founder ownership and board structures on the investment behavior of three classes of institutional investors. We test our hypotheses with a sample of publicly traded corporations between 1991 and 2006, and report strong support for most of our predictions. (c) Academy of Management Journal.

We study whether environmental reporting serves as a transparency tool to communicate sound environmental policies to stakeholders or rather as a manipulation tool of stakeholders' perceptions. In particular, we focus on the relationship between environmental disclosure tone and future environmental performance and we furthermore explore the role of the board of directors' monitoring and stakeholder orientation in shaping this relationship. Using a sample of 288 US oil and gas firms, we find that the bias towards positive language does not reflect purely opportunistic managerial reasons, but rather is a transparency tool to signal future environmental performance. In addition, we document that the stakeholder orientation of the board plays a transparency role in communicating the firm's superior performance. Our findings contribute to the debate on whether discretionary strategies in environmental reporting are more about increased transparency or about stakeholder manipulation. Moreover, they help investors and policymakers to interpret managers' language choices. (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

Organizational boards of directors are one of the most important subgroups within most modern organizations, performing critical advisory, monitoring and resource dependence roles. This paper investigates the crucial question of whether the stock market values ethnic and gender diversity within organizational boards. We find that board diversity is positively associated with market valuation. We distinctively demonstrate further that ethnic diversity is valued more highly by the stock market than gender diversity. By contrast, we do not find any evidence of a significant non-linear link between board diversity and market valuation. Our findings are robust across a number of econometric models that deal with different types of endogeneities and market valuation measures. Overall, our results are consistent with agency and resource dependence theoretical predictions. (c) 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This paper sets out to shed light on female representation on Italian corporate boards before the introduction of gender quota legislation in 2012, as well as on the relevance of family connections. We investigate the potential determinants of having boards with diverse representation and the correlation between female directorship and family connections, with a focus on governance measures. Research Findings: Using data on all directors of Italian publicly traded companies from 2008 to 2010, we identify two different models. In the majority of gender-diverse boards, at least one woman has a family connection to the controlling shareholder. Family-affiliated women are more common in companies that are small, have a concentrated ownership, are in the consumer sector, and have a larger board. Conversely, non-family-affiliated women are more common on the boards of companies that are widely held, have younger and more educated boards, have a higher proportion of independent directors, and have a smaller number of interlocked directors. With reference to governance-related outcomes, the number of board meetings appears to be negatively correlated to both the presence of family members and female directors. Additionally, women show lower attendance than men at board meetings. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The paper provides support for theories on the differences between the governance of family-owned and non-family-owned companies. Practitioner/Policy Implication: The study offers insights to policymakers implementing gender quota legislation. Substantial effort should be devoted to ensuring that board diversity is associated with actual independence of board members. (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to advance the understanding of the relationship between firm-level governance mechanisms and firm performance using a contingency framework. The contingency framework is based on an integration of agency theory, stewardship theory, resource dependence theory and stakeholder theory of firm governance. Design/methodology/approach - The authors test the arguments on a sample of all the listed firms on the New Zealand Stock Exchange between 2004 and 2007. Given the longitudinal nature of the data, the authors employ random effects, generalized least square estimation to run the regression models. Findings - The authors find that the presence of internal directors, CEO duality, board size and presence of professional directors leads to superior firm performance. A lack of ownership concentration leads to agency problems resulting in inferior performance. However, the positive effect of board independence on firm performance reduces in firms that have a high-ownership concentration. Additionally, a high-ownership concentration attenuates the positive effects of board size and board competence. Originality/value - This study helps reconcile some of the conflicting findings on firm governance-performance relationship. As the findings suggest, the effectiveness of a particular governance mechanism (such as board members) may depend on the presence or absence of another governance mechanism (such as ownership concentration). The integrative, multi-theoretic model that the authors propose in this paper is a unique contribution to the governance literature. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited 0025-1747

This paper highlights the importance of a firm's board with respect to sustainability issues by analysing the relationship between director interlocks, i.e. directors who simultaneously belong to the boards of directors of several companies, and a firm's environmental performance. The previous literature has focused on the influence of firm-level resources on corporate environmental performance. This study utilizes insights from a resource-based view and research on social capital to demonstrate that the environmental performance of a firm is also influenced by the difficult-to-imitate capabilities that are embedded in the network relationships of its directors. Our results support a contingency perspective of the social capital theory that finds that director interlocks are positively connected with the environmental performance of a firm in two specific situations: (1) when the firm is linked to a larger parent company and (2) in cases of low and high levels of interlock diversity.

One of the institutions in which the gender gap remains a contestable issue is the board of directors, where the proportion of female directors is still low. While some countries have achieved higher proportions of female directors on their corporate boards, others have not registered even a single one. Drawing on social role theory, that places emphasis on traditional gender activities, this study starts by arguing that board directorship is an agentic role and more suitable for men. The study shows that key social institutions have the potential to alleviate such stereotypical attitudes or to maintain the status quo. Employing a robust statistical technique in two-stage least squares (2SLS), this study finds that the representation of women in other key national institutions, such as in politics, positively affects the appointment of female directors on boards. On the other hand, religiosity has a negative causal effect on female board appointments. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose - This paper aims to provide insights on the gender-performance relationship, this paper studies the impact of board gender diversity on firm performance, by taking into account the "critical mass" of women directors and their educational level. Design/methodology/approach - The hypotheses are tested on a unique dataset of 211 European Union publicly listed companies in 2012 belonging to the construction industry from 28 different countries through a set of ordinary least squares regressions. Findings - The evidence shows that the "critical mass" rather than the simple presence of women has an incremental benefit on firm performance. In addition, results show that the educational level of women directors negatively affects firm performance, as it might impact the dynamics within the boardroom. Research limitations/implications - The quantitative nature of the study does not allow drawing strong inferences on behavioral processes and dynamics in and around the boardroom. Nevertheless, this study will open new research insights on exploring the educational level on board. Practical implications - Regulators and policymakers that should be aware of the influence of women as a group on firm performance and that this role is differential across industries. Originality/value - The novelty of this paper is that it investigates the role of women in a high masculine gender-specific industry and explores a still poorly understood demographic variable (i.e. the educational level) of women directors.

Purpose - This paper aims to report the results of an investigation into the effect of corporate governance factors on the performance of listed small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and examines whether this effect differs between the two sizes of business. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses unbalanced panel data regression analysis on a sample of 234 SMEs listed on the Alternative Investment Market, for a 10-year period (2004-2013). Findings - The panel data analysis results show that for all SMEs, corporate governance factors - board size, chief executive officer (CEO) age and tenure and directors' remuneration - are significantly associated with performance of SMEs. The results also suggest that while board size is associated with the performance of both small and medium enterprises, CEO age is significant only for medium firms and directors' remuneration only for small ones, while CEO tenure and proportion of non-executive directors are not significant for either. Practical implications - Overall, the results imply that corporate governance factors affect the performance of listed SMEs. However, this effect differs significantly between small and medium enterprises. The findings have important implications for policymakers who prescribe corporate governance mechanisms for SMEs. Originality/value - The paper adds to existing literature on corporate governance of SMEs by establishing a relationship between firm performance and board size, CEO age, CEO tenure, directors' remuneration and proportion of non-executive directors.

Boards of directors are in a position to contribute vital knowledge resources to strategy-making. We propose that the relation between board functional background heterogeneity and exploration-focused versus exploitation-focused strategy is contingent on the extent to which the institutionally adopted board model enables or constrains inclusion of the board's knowledge resources in strategy-making. We empirically juxtapose the Anglo-Saxon ('one-tier') and Rhineland ('two-tier') board models in the U.K. and Germany, respectively, and find support for our assertion that the influence of board functional background heterogeneity on relative exploration orientation is more pronounced when the adopted board model accommodates inclusion of the board's knowledge resources into strategy-making. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2015 Strategic Management Society.

The main objective of this paper is to explore the role of family councils vis-a-vis corporate governance mechanisms. Particularly, the paper explores whether family councils perform only their distinctive family governance role or if they also substitute for the roles performed by corporate governance control mechanisms. Based on a sample of 243 Italian family SMEs, our research findings show that the family council partially substitutes the shareholders' meeting and the board of directors in playing their respective corporate governance roles of ownership and monitoring. These findings are interpreted in the light of both agency and relational perspectives. (c) 2013 International Council for Small Business.

Research on corporate governance has attempted to investigate the added value of boards of directors through the lenses of both demographic and behavioral approaches. However, investigations into these two approaches, and the subsequent implications for firm performance, have thus far been mainly decoupled from one another. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to put both approaches to the test in the family business context. Using a sample of 567 Spanish family firms, we find that although both approaches can explain the performance of family firms, the behavioral approach explains a much higher proportion of the variation in the firm's performance. Furthermore, our findings support our hypotheses that the relationship between the proportion of outside directors and firm performance follows an inverted U-shape in private family firms, and that both business-oriented and family-oriented board role performance are positively related with firm performance.

This study examines the influence of women on the boards of directors of National Health Service Foundation Trusts (FTs) in England. FTs provide a public service where social performance is the primary objective, although financial constraints must be met. Female presence (the proportion of women) is higher for executive directors than non-executives, reflecting the high number of women employed in the sector. We find that a high female presence among executive and non-executive directorships does not result in significant differences either in financial return or service quality. When gender diversity on boards is consistently high (high level of female presence across boards), the benefits on performance of having more women on the board may not be discernible. However, female Chairs or Chief Executives result in significant reductions in negative social outcomes, such as lower clinical negligence costs, without harming financial management. The findings of this study, carried out in a context of high female presence and where a woman frequently occupies one of the two most influential board positions, Chair and Chief Executive, have implications for gender diversity and gender targets on the boards of directors in business and other sectors.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss a research model that presents three metrics of corporate social performance (CSP): board interlocks, director's profile and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Design/methodology/approach - Based on social network theories, the authors argue the possible relationships between the three variables. The authors conduct the study on 255 directorships in the boards of 20 listed companies in France, which participate in Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for 2010. Findings - The results show that director's background and nationality diversity in the board are the most relevant attributes to discerning firms with high CSR scores. However, the relationship between board interlocks and CSR is not consistent. Some explanations are reported and discussed. Research limitations/implications - The research contributes to recognize the most influential variables in board composition for firms with high CSR scores, although it is based on a conceptual development and an explorative analysis. It could constitute the basis for future research which integrates modeling and multivariate analysis. Practical implications - Diversity in the board could be an effective tool to guide management for more CSR decisions. Social implications - The paper highlights the importance of diversifying the recruitment base when integrating new board members. This implies opening board networks to new profiles, in order to better meet stakeholders' expectations regarding CSR. Originality/value - The paper contributes to board literature by highlighting the importance of combining individual attributes (director) with corporate ones (board of directors) to better assess the role of board of directors in the adoption of CSR' practices.

From the perspective of agency, resource-based view, and resource-dependence theories, we explore the impact of the presence of outside directors on firm performance in family small and medium-sized enterprise (SMEs). Using survey data from 369 Spanish family SMEs, our findings show an inverted U-shaped relationship between the proportion of outsiders on the boards of first- and second-generation family firms and firm performance. The results show that a balanced presence of outside directors contributes to value creation in family SMEs and confirm that the composition and the roles of the board of directors differ from generation to generation in family firms.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine corporate governance practices in an emerging economy. It focusses on how ownership control and board control systems operate in corporate organisations in an emergent economy, assuming that these systems are essential for enhancing good corporate governance practices in emerging countries.Design/methodology/approach: The paper builds on descriptive multiple-case study with multiple units of analysis to divulge how ownership control and board control systems function to ensuring effective corporate governance in publicly listed corporate organisations in Ghana. A criterion-based sampling technique is used to select the companies. Thereafter, three techniques of data collection are used to gather data from the companies: archival records, semi-structured interviews and observation.Findings: By linking the gathered data to the paper's theoretical propositions, the study highlights that all the companies are characterised by the presence of large shareholders, and, in consequence, they tend to exert extensive control over the activities of the companies through their involvement in the decision-making processes. However, whilst the presence of large shareholders has the tendency to solve the agency problem, it poses challenges in regards to minority shareholders' interests in these corporate organisations. The study also reveals that boards of directors tend to exercise control over corporate organisations when majority shareholders stop interfering in their dealings. This implies that when major shareholders fully partake in corporate decision-making processes of companies, boards of directors seem to be sheer advisory bodies to management.Research limitations/implications: This is a paper to shed light on corporate governance practices in four large publicly listed corporate organisations on the Ghana Stock Exchange, so the observable facts do not apply to other emergent economies. In addition, the sample does not represent all corporate organisations in Ghana; thus, the empirical observations cannot be generalised to other organisations that have not been included in this study. However, the empirical results can be applied to other similar corporations in Ghana and other emergent economies in an analytical sense. With the application of inductive reasoning, the results can be applied to provide important appreciation in an effort to understand the structure of corporate governance practices in organisations in developing countries.Practical implications: A comparative analysis of the empirical observations from this study and the recommended guidelines of corporate governance of Ghana has been carried out, and aspects in which organisations need to reform and improve to fully comply with the guidelines are highlighted: director independence, director evaluation, introduction of new directors and board education. This could possibly be the foundation upon which corporate governance structures in these organisations can be restructured and further enhanced.Originality/value: The majority of the studies of corporate governance in emergent economies have used quantitative techniques to examine the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and firm performance. However, this study takes a different approach to examine corporate governance practice in an emergent economy by using a comprehensive and defensible qualitative analysis to examine relations between ownership structure and shareholder control, and board of directors and board control. In addition, it highlights how ownership and board control systems interact in corporate organisations in emergent economies. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The attraction of blue-chip listings in emerging stock markets is a major policy initiative common across much of the developing world. In many cases however, local blue-chip firms are the result of foreign Multinational Enterprise (MNE) firms engaging with local indigenous partners to form an international joint venture (IJV). These are unique with bilateral governance structures underscoring co-ownership between partners of residual cash flows and assets of the IJV. Using a unique and comprehensive sample of 202 IPO firms from across the emerging African region evidence of both a pronounced internal as well as external role for IJV boards was found. Social and political legitimacy concerns dominate the external role of boards in particular. Increasing proportions of boards drawn from commercial and governmental social elites are associated with IJV IPO firms in high institutional quality while lower proportions of these elites are associated with civil code law jurisdictions rather than common law. Governmental elites are associated with country-level improvements in corruption control and political stability while commercial elites are only marginally associated with improvements in political stability, regulatory quality, rule of law and democratic voice and accountability measures.

This research work has as its aim to determine, at international level, the relationship between the composition of the board of Directors and the level of practices associated with corporate social responsibility (CSR). To do this, a sample of 1,043 international companies for the period 2003-2009 was used. The empirical evidence obtained showed an inverted-U relationship between the size of the Board and CSR practices, as well as a balance between independence (independent directors) and information/knowledge (executive directors) of the Board. Furthermore, it was found that the companies with greater diversity among their directors in terms of nationality and gender, as well as a greater activity of the Board to present a higher social, economic and environmental responsibility. Finally, the results have shown that companies from English-speaking countries promote CSR practices to a lesser extent than their continental counterpart (situated in German and Latin-American environments), mainly due to their greater orientation towards the investor.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the importance of human capital and professional networks for women's and men's appointment to the boards of directors of public companies. The study provides an in-depth analysis of how human capital and professional networks contribute to women's as compared with men's odds of corporate board membership. Design/methodology/approach - The study analyzes the human capital and professional networks of 494 male and female corporate outside (non-executive) directors appointed between 2005 and 2010 to the boards of US public companies listed in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. Human capital was measured as director age, education and professional experience (function and role). Professional network variables measured included composition of professional network, network centrality, constraint and cohesion. Findings - The study's findings reveal that the characteristics that impact the appointment of women as outside directors to public company boards differ from those of men. Relative to men, certain professions such as government relations and education improve the odds of appointment of women to corporate boards, while age lowers women's odds. The number of network ties and the degree of network cohesion were also significant in predicting the likelihood of female board appointment to public corporations relative to men's odds. The final model was able to predict female board membership correctly only in 28 per cent of the cases, while male board membership was predicted in 89 per cent of the cases, suggesting that factors other than human capital and professional networks (e.g. their gender) impact women's appointment to corporate boards. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to comprehensively examine the professional network components of female and male directors along with their human capital in the analysis of their prospects for board appointment. The conceptualization of professional networks as well the depth of quantitative analysis of the network components of the study advance the extant literature on the composition of corporate boards.

In recent years, shareholders, regulators, and academics have become increasingly interested in how multinational enterprises (MNEs) can ensure sound corporate governance throughout all entities within a firm. One important mechanism available to MNEs for improving their global governance is the subsidiary board of directors. However, to date scant academic research has focused on the roles of subsidiary boards and the factors that influence their involvement in different roles. Using survey data from a sample of MNE subsidiaries operating in Belgium with headquarters in 14 different countries, we find that a subsidiary board performs four roles: control, strategy, coordination, and service. Further, a subsidiary board is more involved in control, strategy, and service roles if the subsidiary operates only in the local market, independently from the headquarters (the local implementer subsidiary). In particular, the board of the local implementer subsidiary is more involved in strategy and coordination roles when more directors are headquarters country nationals. Our findings collectively suggest that the subsidiary board facilitates a subsidiary's pursuit of its strategic objective and helps to manage the headquarters-subsidiary agency problem. Moreover, subsidiary directors' characteristics influence the subsidiary board's ability to perform its roles. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to test the association between board of director characteristics and corporate reputation. Design/methodology/approachLogistic and multivariate regressions are performed to analyse whether the board of director characteristics are associated with the level of corporate reputation. The sample is composed of listed companies in the Madrid Stock Exchange (Indice General de la Bolsa de Madrid) at least once during the period 2004-2010. Corporate governance data were manually extracted from governance reports released by Spanish companies. The data for the design of a corporate reputation measure were obtained from the Monitor Espanol de Reputacion Corporativa (MERCO) institute web site. FindingsResults from the empirical analysis show that Spanish companies that appear high up in terms of ranking in the reputation index provided by MERCO tend to have a higher percentage of independent directors as well as more female directors on their board. Firm size and the image of the president of a firm are also linked to corporate reputation. Originality/valueThe results have direct implications for the management of corporate governance mechanisms by shareholders who should take into account their role in the creation and maintenance of corporate reputation.

Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore how initial public offering (IPO) investors view female presence on boards of directors in the USA. Design/methodology/approach - This study utilizes hierarchical regression and analyzes data collected from firms undertaking their IPO's in the USA during 1997 and 2007. Findings - The findings of this study suggest that US IPO investors react negatively to female presence on the board of directors. However, this negative effect has weakened post-Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Research limitations/implications - The results of this study may not generalize to other settings. Practical implications - Gender bias against females in the boardroom exists but appears to be weaker post-Sarbanes-Oxley. Social implications - One hurdle to greater female representation in entrepreneurial ventures in the USA may be weakening as a result of greater awareness of female director contributions to board functioning. Originality/value - First, the study represents one of the few attempts to examine the influence of female directors on organizational outcomes in IPO firms. Second, this study represents one of the first studies to consider the influence of director gender on IPO performance. Finally, this study extends extant research by examining investor reactions to female board presence. The results of this study suggest that bias against females in the boardroom may exist but appears to be weakening post-Sarbanes-Oxley. This finding indicates increasing awareness of female director contributions to board functioning on the part of IPO investors. (c) 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore how an environmental threat (possible quotas for female supervisory directors) might change supervisory board gender composition in SBF120 French company boards between 2008 and 2010. Design/methodology/approach - From a census of supervisory board membership of SBF120 companies in France in January 2008 and December 2010, data were obtained to test hypotheses relating to changes in gender composition of boards and demographic differences between new and earlier director appointees. The authors drew on institutional theory to inform the discussion of this paper's findings. Findings - The authors reveal significant increases over 2008-2010 in SBF120 board female representation and significant cohort differences between recent and earlier appointees. Newer female appointees differed from male peers and from earlier appointed females and males, bringing youth and international experience. New females were more likely to gain CAC40 seats than their male peers. There was an increase in boards with multiple female directors. Research limitations/implications - Actual motivations for increase in female appointments are unknown, but institutional theory provides possible explanations, as suggestion of coercive forces loomed. Chairmen of larger firms may have made strategic choices to attract younger and English-speaking foreign women, before the rush. Limitations include the descriptive nature of the paper, but it sets a benchmark for later studies to monitor progress in depth. Practical implications - The talent pool for female directors has widened to include foreign English-speaking women, bringing a range of new insights and experience of international governance practice to traditional French boardrooms. However, this could be seen as further discriminatory practice that requires female appointees to bring more human and social capital than that required of their male peers. Originality/value - This is the first paper charting the changes in supervisory board composition during the three-year period of environmental unrest as quotas were proposed and legislated in France and comparing new and existing cohort French director demographics.

This article presents a review of the studies on on boards of directors and corporate social responsibility practices in the banking industry. Several characteristics of bank boards, in particular independence and diversity, may impact their CSR commitments. By studying a sample of 159 banks in nine countries during the period 2004-2010, there is evidence that suggests that banks with more independent and diverse directors follow a path of socially responsible behaviour.

Purpose - Director selection is an important yet under-researched topic. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to extant literature by gaining a greater understanding into how and why new board members are recruited. Design/methodology/approach - This exploratory study uses in-depth interviews with Australian non-executive directors to identify what selection criteria are deemed most important when selecting new director candidates and how selection practices vary between organisations. Findings - The findings indicate that appointments to the board are based on two key attributes: first, the candidates' ability to contribute complementary skills and second, the candidates' ability to work well with the existing board. Despite commonality in these broad criteria, board selection approaches vary considerably between organisations. As a result, some boards do not adequately assess both criteria when appointing a new director hence increasing the chance of a mis-fit between the position and the appointed director. Research limitations/implications - The study highlights the importance of both individual technical capabilities and social compatibility in director selections. The authors introduce a new perspective through which future research may consider director selection: fit. Originality/value - The in-depth analysis of the director selection process highlights some less obvious and more nuanced issues surrounding directors' appointment to the board. Recurrent patterns indicate the need for both technical and social considerations. Hence the study is a first step in synthesising the current literature and illustrates the need for a multi-theoretical approach in future director selection research.

The objective of this paper is to obtain empirical evidence of the relationship between board structure, ownership composition, and the level of corporate governance transparency in the largest listed companies of Latin America. A correlational study was conducted with a longitudinal analysis using data from the largest listed comanies in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico during the period 2004-2010. The results show that the level of transparency is higher in companies with larger boards and with a higher percentage of independent directors. Meanwhile, the composition of ownership inhibits the level of transparency in corporate governance, while the presence of family shareholders encourages greater disclosure of corporate information.

We investigate the relationship between corporate board of directors' attributes and conditional accounting conservatism in the French context. Using a pooled regression model over the period 2009-2012, our empirical results can be summarized as follows. First, greater board activity encourages more conservative reporting in financial statements. Second, larger board size diminishes conditional accounting conservatism. Lastly, there is a positive association between gender diversity and accounting conservatism. As a robustness test, we use alternative measures of accounting conservatism, namely time series and accrual-based measures in addition to asymmetric timeliness of earnings. Our findings suggest that boards of directors' attributes are an important factor in determining the financial reporting quality of French firms. (c) 2015, CIBER Institute. All right reserved.

We study how New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) firms adopted governance committees on their boards of directors. The drive to adopt started as a social movement but was facilitated greatly by the collapse of Enron Corporation and a subsequent mandate by the NYSE that all of its traded firms must have governance committees. Using institutional theory and a sample of NYSE firms, we develop and test hypotheses about the speed of governance committee adoption, the likelihood of committee adoption by the NYSE deadline, and the types of directors that were placed on the inaugural governance committee. Our study adds to theory about how organizations respond to external pressures when responding is contrary to the interests of executives. (c) 2013, (c) The Author(s) 2013.

In this article, we build on recent attempts to theorize about the evolution of boards of directors by juxtaposing firms' strategies to gain, maintain, and repair legitimacy onto their life cycle to examine how board characteristics change-both symbolically and substantively-to reflect their firm's evolving legitimating strategy. In doing so, we develop insights contributing to our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the evolving structure and composition of boards of directors. We suggest that boards fulfill an important role ingrained in the firm's legitimacy in addition to, and intertwined with, their substantive contribution to the firm's performance at each life cycle stage. We also address firms' real ability to effect change in their board as a function of the factors that pertain to each stage of life cycle. We conclude by expounding the implications of this novel framework for future research and managerial practice.

Top management teams frequently overemphasize efforts to exploit the current product portfolio, even in the face of the strong need to step up exploration activities. This mismanagement of the balance between explorative R&D activities and exploitation of the current product portfolio can result in the so-called success trap, the situation where explorative activities are fully suppressed. The success trap constitutes a serious threat to the long-term viability of a firm. Recent studies of publicly traded corporations suggest that the suppression of exploration arises from the interplay among the executive team's myopic forces, the board of directors as gatekeeper of the capital market, and the exploitation-exploration investments and their outcomes. In this paper, system dynamics modeling serves to identify and test ways in which top management teams can counteract this suppression process. For instance, we find that when the executive board is suppressing exploration, the board of directors can still prevent the success trap by actively intervening in the exploitation-exploration strategy.

Purpose - This paper aims to fill the gap of the relatively under-researched impact of women directors on initial public offering (IPO) underpricing in developing countries. Gender diversity is an important emerging issue within the corporate governance literature. Recently, there has been a growing thrust on gender-diverse boards. However, their proportion on corporate boards is low worldwide. The paper examines the influence of women directors on the underpricing phenomenon pervasive in the IPO context. Design/methodology/approach - Gender diversity is an important emerging issue within the corporate governance literature. Recently, there has been a growing thrust on gender diverse boards. However, their proportion on corporate boards is low worldwide. The impact of women directors on IPO underpricing in developing countries remains relatively under-researched. This paper aims to fill this gap in research. The paper examines the influence of women directors on the underpricing phenomenon pervasive in the IPO context. Findings - The results suggest that the subscription ratio, listing delay and block holder ownership positively influence raw returns and market-adjusted excess returns. The proportion of women directors showed negative non-significant impact on both type of returns. We did not find evidence of the other explanatory variables included in the model. Research limitations/implications - The relatively low proportion of female directors may be the reason for some of the non-significant findings. Future research with a good gender balance on boards is likely to help generalising the findings. Other confounding factors also need to be included in the model for deeper explanations of the phenomenon. Practical implications - The study highlights the existence of a "glass ceiling" in Indian corporate settings, where women have to make a tough fight. This barrier must be removed to unleash the real talent of women as directors and see this talent reflected in returns. Social implications - The paper highlights both the need to better manage the gender balance in corporate board rooms and the need to incorporate women's talents in corporate and investment decisions. Originality/value - The paper highlights the significant gender gap in IPO directorial positions in developing countries such as India. It explores female directors' contributions in initial pricing performance, which remain unaddressed in this part of the world. Insights into this sensitive issue in an emerging economy such as India can provide important inputs. (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited

There is an increasing scholarly interest in how social enterprises manage their hybrid nature. As hybrid organizational forms, social enterprises combine mission-driven social goals and revenue generating activities in a variety of organizational constellations and in diverse institutional contexts. Acknowledging the potentially conflicting demands that institutional environments impose on social enterprises there is an increasing research interest in the existence and proliferation of these conflicting demands at the organizational level. Some researchers have pointed to the importance of particular management practices and governance characteristics - such as authority relations and internal representation - as mechanisms to deal with the conflicting demands at the organizational level. This paper adds to this stream of literature by taking into account the organizational level dynamics of internal representation and the proliferation of factional groups in the boards of directors of hybrid organizational forms and their impact on board performance, ultimately influencing the organizational performance.

Examining board of directors' decision making in case studies of CEOs and board members in four US companies, we found that an "inner board" of directors and CEOs linked by network ties outside of board meetings contained the most influential board members who also shared cognitions about problems. This informal network of ties was affected by the formal governance structure of the board. Strong ties in the informal network led to shared cognitions on the board, demonstrating a link between the formal and network positions of board members and their decision making.

Using resource-based logic as well as stewardship and agency theories, we address a paradox when governing young firms-how to design governance structures to encourage top managers to generate rents while minimizing the threat of rent appropriation. Some corporate governance mechanisms (CGMs) enhance empowerment and encourage managers to generate rents for the firm. But these CGMs may also allow managers to appropriate rents excessively. The solution appears to be combining CGMs that empower managers to generate rents with CGMs that either (a) motivate stewardship behavior or (b) reduce information asymmetry between management and other stakeholders.

Taking the assumptions of the resource dependency theory as our starting point, the main objectiveof this investigation is to gain an understanding of how and in what way board members who serveon multiple boards (interlocks) can affect a firm's profitability, and whether it is useful to consider thederivation of these interlocks according to the type of board member (executive or non-executive) whopossesses them. Using dynamic panel data analysis (GMM) and a sample of 88 firms quoted on theSpanish Continuous Market for the period 2005-2008, our results confirm the existence of a curvilinear(inverted-U) relation between interlocks and firm performance. The results demonstrate that this relationis only significant if we include the total number of external ties rather than just the number of linksgenerated by non-executive directors. We can also confirm that the degree of familiarity and sharedknowledge between board members (measured by average board tenure) affects this relationship. (c) 2015 AEDEM.

PurposeFrom the resource-based view (RBV), the purpose of this paper is to argue that the board has the capability to participate in international strategic decisions and deal with the environmental complexities that internationalisation brings; and moreover, to achieve better performance than its competitors. Design/methodology/approachThis paper highlights the active participation of the board in firm internationalisation using a sample of 78 Spanish firms quoted on Madrid Stock Exchange. The authors used a longitudinal analysis from 2005 through 2010. FindingsThe results show that while the resources provided by the directors through their level of education and international experience, help them learn and process information, and they are a source of expertise representing "board potential";. A board that functions well through the directors' relationships allow the proper integration and use of these resources, and helps create sustainable competitive advantages in an international context. Originality/valueFrom a RBV, this paper refines and extends the concept of "board capability"; as the combination of potential and internal relations that allow boards to undertake their roles competently over time. Additionally, the paper empirically examines the effect of board capability on firm internationalisation. (c) 2015, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Biotech firms are faced with particularly complex decisions early in their development. Because of the specific nature of their products, their growth strategy rapidly entails the internationalisation of their activities, especially through alliances. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) wishing to develop and access complementary skills may use corporate boards and scientific advisory boards. The resource-based view provides a compelling rationale for efficiently using these external sources of knowledge in order to access the key resources SMEs need to improve their performance. This study investigates how corporate and scientific advisory boards are involved in the internationalisation of biotech firms through strategic alliances. Based on semi-structured interviews and secondary data from 22 biotechnology firms, we describe the characteristics of these external sources of strategic advice and explore their impact on the firms' internationalisation. A discussion of the results, along with their implications for future research and managerial practices are also presented. Copyright (c) 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Decades-long research on boards of directors based on the agency theoretic insider/outsider distinction (Fama & Jensen, 1983) has yielded limited results regarding the effectiveness of boards as monitors of senior management (Johnson, S., Schnatterly, & Hill, 2013) leading governance scholars to incorporate agency theory based distinctions with rich characterizations of the human capital of board composition. This study examines the human capital brought to the boards of directors by active CEOs.

The role of corporate governance in financial institutions differs from that of non- financial institutions for the discretionary power of the board of directors would be limited especially in regulated financial systems where financial institutions are obliged to function through legislative and prescriptive procedures, policies, rules and regulations. This study, therefore, was aimed at examining the impact of corporate governance on the performance of closely regulated Ethiopian insurance Industry. The study employed explanatory research design with an econometric panel data of 10 Insurance companies that covers the period 2007 to 2014. Board size, board independence and board diversity have negative and insignificant effect on the performance of insurance companies while size and independence of audit committee and frequency of board meetings have positive but insignificant effect on the performance of insurance companies in Ethiopia. Thus it could be concluded that all corporate governance mechanisms have insignificant effect on the performance of insurance companies measured by return on asset. This vividly affirms that the role of board of directors in closely regulated financial sector is dismal and insignificant for they have limited discretionary power to exercise as board of directors. Thus it would be recommendable if the regulatory body could relax its prescriptive and stringent policies and devolve its power to board of directors without endangering the viability of insurance companies.

This paper gives the empirical analysis of the impact of the boards of directors' composition and structure and the personal characteristics of the boards' members on corporate performance of Russian public and non-public companies. Hypothesis that describe the influence of the boards' characteristics on corporate performance are tested on the panel data of 200 Russian large and medium joint-stock companies during the period between 2007-2011. As a result, we show that firms' efficiency depends on a number of the boards' characteristics (the share of the executive directors, the number of directors with the working experience in the industry, chairman working in the boards of other companies).

This paper tries to answer the question of top management, public policy makers, researchers and scholars of how important the role of Corporate Governance (CG) and best practices are. Although there are plenty of previous researches, we find it necessary to conduct this study because we believe the outcome will be significant to Bolivia's corporate governance and best practices in order to support and validate the application of the CG's code as management strategy. Likewise, the lack of academic research about this subject in a developing country where these kinds of practices are just starting to be promoted is an important fact, enlightening firms to consider this public policy in order to be more competitive and efficient. We use Pearson's correlations analysis in contrast with multiple regression analysis to examine the significance of Board of directors' characteristics on financial performance ratios and the influence on firm value.

Despite the socio-political, ethical and business case for female board membership, women remain underrepresented in company boards. Using theories that support the membership of women on boards, this article presents the case for gender diversity in the boardroom. By employing a sample of 506 directors from 56 JSE-listed mining companies this article reports on the demographic characteristics, percentage of women in mining boards, and attributes that are predictive of women's membership on boards. Results show that women serving on mining boards possess specialised knowledge in combination with advanced education. They either bring external support as outsiders, or are support specialists with financial, legal, arts and economics backgrounds. This study recommends the development of a talent management framework of women directors focused on their recruitment, development and retention. (c) 2015, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

The strategic role of the board of directors can be a competitive advantage for family firms. In fact, in medium-sized family firms the more the board is involved in the firm strategy, the better performance it gets. However, this relationship is mediated by some variables that may enhance or inhibit this effect. In this chapter, the impact of the entrepreneurial orientation variable is analysed as a mediator between the strategic involvement of the board of directors (SIBD) and performance. We test these hypotheses by surveying the CEOs of 230 Spanish medium-sized family businesses. The results obtained through the Partial Least Square (PLS) technique show that the entrepreneurial orientation of the family firm has a positive effect on the relationship between SIBD and performance.

Despite the growing interest in IJVs and their governance, systematic research is limited on the board of directors and their roles in international joint ventures in emerging markets. In this study, we draw from corporate governance research that suggests that the levels of control and collaboration by boards are influenced by organizational complexity. While joint ventures possess several similarities compared to unitary firms, they also have unique sources of complexity given the fact that two or more international partners collaborate within JVs under an incomplete contract. Based on a sample of 114 IJVs, we argue and show four separate conditions that influence the functions that boards undertake as well as how control and collaboration as two separate functions are interrelated. Our findings address calls for research to open the black box of what boards actually do as well as to bring corporate governance theory to new organizational forms such as joint ventures.

This study empirically analyzes whether gender diversity enhances boards of directors' independence and efficiency. Using data from 3,876 public firms in 47 countries and controlling for a wide set of corporate governance mechanisms, we find that firms with more female directors have higher firm performance by market (Tobin's Q) and accounting (return on assets) measures. The results also suggest that external independent directors do not contribute to firm performance unless the board is gender diversified. These results hold with respect to different estimation models and robustness tests. Overall, our findings provide evidence that the female directors enhance boards of directors' effectiveness. Finally, we find that firms that are concerned with board independence, and that firms in more complex environments are more likely to have gender-balanced boards.

In this paper, we draw on insights from theories in the management and corporate governance literature to develop a theoretical model that makes explicit the links between a firm's corporate social responsibility (CSR) related board attributes, its board CSR strategy, and its environmental and social performance. We then test the model using structural equation modeling approach. We find that the greater the CSR orientation of the board (as measured by the board's independence, gender diversity, and financial expertise on audit committee), the more proactive and comprehensive the firm's CSR strategy, and the higher its environmental and social performance. Moreover, we find this link to be endogenous and self-reinforcing, with superior CSR performers tending to further strengthen their board CSR orientation. This result while positive is also suggestive of the widening of the gap between the leads and laggards in CSR. Therefore, the question arises as to how 'leaders' are using their superior CSR competencies seen by many scholars as a source of corporate (at times unfair) competitive advantage. Stakeholders of corporations therefore need to be cognizant of this aspect of CSR when evaluating a firm's CSR activities. Policy makers also need to be cognizant of these concerns when designing regulation in this field. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Research Question: Whether and how women directors influence firms' engagement in socially responsible business practices and social reputation among diverse stakeholders is unclear due to conflicting empirical evidence, the lack of a coherent theory linking these variables, and inattention to the national contexts in which these relationships occurs. Research Findings: Results from our meta-analysis of 87 independent samples suggest that, while generally positive, the female board representation-social performance relationship is even more positive in national contexts when boards may be more motivated to draw on the resources that women directors bring to a board (i.e., among firms operating in countries with stronger shareholder protections) and in contexts where intra-board power distribution may be more balanced (i.e., in countries with higher gender parity). Theoretical Implications: Future studies should more attentively examine how firms' institutional contexts enhance or mitigate the relationship between women's representation on boards and corporate social performance. Our findings also highlight the need for a comprehensive understanding of the social performance-related knowledge, perspectives, and values that men and women bring to boards. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results suggest that, to enhance any benefits of diversity for corporate social performance, efforts be directed at holding boards more accountable toward diverse stakeholders and improving the status of women in society and in the workforce.

Resource dependence theorists argue that boards of directors with political capital can benefit focal firms by reducing uncertainty and providing preferential resources. Here, we develop theory regarding the downside of board political capital. The problem of principal-principal agency is evident in many parts of the world, and we argue that board political capital can further exacerbate it by enabling large blockholders to undertake more appropriation of firm wealth. Further, we explore how this enabling effect is moderated by ownership-, industry-, and environment-level contingencies. We find empirical support for our arguments using 32,174 directors in 1,046 Chinese listed firms over the period 2008-2011. Our study sheds light on new ways in which resource dependence and agency theories can be integrated to advance the extant research on board governance and corporate political strategy.

In this paper, we investigate the relationship between gender and environmental sustainability. Based on a sample of 296 firms, drawn from the population of US publicly traded firms over a five-year period, we empirically test whether firms that have (1) more gender diverse boards of directors and (2) more policies and practices that enable or reinforce gender diversity throughout the organization, adopted more environmentally responsible policies and practices. We find that both 'demographic' and 'structural' gender diversity are significant predictors of a firm's environmental sustainability initiatives. Our findings show gender diversity is a sustainability issue as well. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

Purpose: This study aims to include two primary goals. First to determine the board characteristics of listed companies in Turkey and second to investigate the effect of board gender diversity on the performance of these companies. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses an instrumental variables regression analysis to investigate the relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance using the data from 2008-2012 of the entities listed on the Borsa Istanbul. Findings: The results indicate that the boards of these companies in Turkey are male-dominated. Moreover, this study shows that the inclusion of female directors is positively related to the financial performance of firms, as measured by the return on assets, the return on equity and the return on sales. Originality/value: Limited empirical studies have been conducted on the relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance in emerging economies. Therefore, there is still no consensus regarding the link between board gender diversity and firm financial performance based upon the mixed and sometimes contradictory results in prior research. Therefore, this study extends the current literature in the context of Turkey, showing that a female member on the board can enhance the financial performance of a company.

We ask whether and when shareholder-oriented foreign owners are likely to change corporate governance logics in a stakeholder-oriented setting by introducing shareholder-oriented governance practices. We focus on board monitoring and claim that because the bundle of practices used in a stakeholder context does not protect shareholder-oriented foreign owners' interests, they seek to introduce their own practices. Our results suggest that board monitoring is only activated when shareholder-oriented foreign ownership is high and that the influence of foreign ownership is especially strong in firms without large domestic owners, with high levels of risk and poor performance. Our findings uncover the possibility of the co-existence of different corporate governance logics within a given country, shaped by the nature and weight of foreign owners Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Excess CEO returns refer to CEO financial returns in excess of shareholder returns. How do boards rein in excess CEO returns? Introducing a social capital view of board monitoring, we suggest that boards face two competing normative pressures - corporate elite norms and monitoring norms. How boards conform to such normative pressures for controlling excess CEO returns is affected by their external and internal social capital. Further, we substantiate our arguments by showing that powerful CEOs and institutional investors may facilitate or constrain the normative pressures existing in the social network and alter the effects of board social capital on excess CEO returns. Data from a sample of U.S. corporations listed on the Standard and Poor's 1,500 index from 1999 to 2010 largely support our framework. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We study the impact of board gender diversity on firm risk-taking in a developing market. Our study is drawn from a sample of 30 Tunisian-listed firms between 1997 and 2010. First, we found that women have a risk perception that leads to risk avoidance behaviour: the presence of women directors, even when there is one woman director, is positively associated with cash ratio. Second, we showed no significant relationship between board gender diversity and the propensity to take strategic or financial risk-taking. Third, the presence of state officer/bureaucrats and/or politically connected women have a positive effect on cash holding and investment opportunities. Finally, we found that foreign investors do not invest in firms with gender-diverse boards. We conclude with a discussion of contributions to scholarship and practice, and present avenues for future research. Copyright (c) 2015 ASAC. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper explores the interaction between a prominent board of directors and the network of inter-firm relationships on new product development. Specifically, we posit a positive interaction effect between a prominent board and the inter-firmnetwork and structural holes positions on the number of newproducts developed by the firm. We test the theoretical framework on a sample of 1758 agreements among 1890 biopharmaceutical firms over the period 2006-2010.We find that by filtering, complementing and legitimizing information coming from the inter-firm network, a prominent interlocking directorate network can improve the inter-firm network's effects on new product development. We discuss important implications for how inter-personal networks (such as the board interlock directorate network) help to develop the effectiveness of inter-firm relationship networks in achieving new product development outcomes.

Agency theory-grounded research on boards of directors and firm legitimacy has historically viewed CEO power as de-legitimating, often taking this fact for granted in theorizing about external assessors' evaluations of a firm. With few exceptions, this literature has focused exclusively on capital market participants (e.g., investors, securities analysts) as the arbiters of a firm's legitimacy and has accordingly assumed that legitimate governance arrangements are those derived from the shareholder-oriented prescriptions of agency theory. We extend this line of research in new ways by arguing that customers also externally assess firm legitimacy, and that firms potentially adjust their governance characteristics to meet customers' norms and expectations. We argue that the cultural-cognitive institutions prevalent in customers' home countries influence their judgments regarding a firm's legitimacy, such that firms competing heavily in highpower distance cultures are more likely to have powerful CEOs, with CEO power a source of legitimacy-rather than illegitimacy-among customers. We also argue that the more dependent a firm is on its customers and the more salient cultural power distance is as a demand-side institutional norm, the greater this relationship will be. Data from 151 U.S. semiconductor and pharmaceutical firms over a 10-year period generally support our predictions. (c) 2016 Academy of Management Journal.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of board diversity on the extent to which firms invest in R&D. Design/methodology/approach - Based on data collected about the composition of the board of directors, the authors determine statistically if the characteristics of directors predicts the extent to which firms invest more in R&D. Findings - The authors find, unexpectedly, that tenure diversity lead firms to invest less in R&D, while education diversity and gender diversity makes firms invest more. Gender diversity positively moderates education diversity as well, strengthening the effect found. Research limitations/implications - The sample of firms the authors include in the paper is restricted due to the overwhelming difficulty in collecting data about the composition of boards of directors, and their backgrounds. Practical implications - The paper offers insights into how boards of directors might need to be composed in order to try have firms invest more in R&D. Social implications - Innovative firms are more competitive and more sustainable. Knowing what contributes to a firm's investment in R&D is thus of great social value. Originality/value - The authors include a much larger set of diversity measures than any previously published study, and provide counter-intuitive findings that have implications for practice, society, as well as theory about team composition.

How do a country's basic institutions enable or hinder women's rise to the boards of public companies? The study evaluates this question with reference to the five basic institutions that research suggests are common across all countries: family, education, economy, government, and religion. The study draws on a sample, which consists of 23 countries, and the study is framed in neo-institutional theory. In analyzing the role of these institutions, the article seeks to understand better the relationships between specific institutions and the share of board seats held by women. The results suggest that four of the five basic institutions are related to the share of board seats women hold. Family, education, economy, and government influence women's rise to the board; however, religion does not influence women's rise to the corporate board of directors.

Research summary: Many boards view their chairs as valuable resources. We predict that whether a board adopts such a view depends on the board chair's human and social capital. Data from S&P 500 firms suggest that while a board chair's human capital increases the probability that the board views him or her as a resource, social capital has no overall effect. In a post-hoc investigation, however, we find the board chair's independence to be an important boundary condition for the effect of social capital. With this exploratory research, we aim to spur research devoted specifically to board chairs. Such research will become increasingly important over time as firms continue to separate their CEO and board chair positions. Managerial summary: The purpose of this research was to determine the factors that lead a board of directors to view its chair as a valuable resource. We expected that board chairs with high human and social capital would be more likely to be viewed as a resource by their colleagues. Surprisingly, only human capital exhibited such an effect overall. Social capital increases the likelihood a chair is viewed as a resource when the chair is independent, but actually decreases the likelihood a chair is viewed as a resource when the chair is either the current or former CEO. These results suggest that boards generally value human capital in their chairs, but view social capital through a somewhat more complex lens. We explore the possible implications of these findings in the article. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study examines how the appointment of former politicians and regulators to boards of directors or management teams influences corporate acquisition activity and performance. We find that bidders with political connections are more likely to acquire targets and avoid regulatory delay or denial. The merger premium paid increases with political connectedness. The announcement period returns show that investors recognize that bids by politically connected acquirers are more likely to create firm value. Connected bidders make more bids and bid on larger targets. Connected acquirers also enjoy superior post-merger financial and operating performance. (c) 2016

Previous studies report inconsistent findings regarding how board monitoring influences firms' research and development (R&D) intensity. This study uses agency theory and resource dependence theory to argue that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between these two constructs. By using board capital theory, the present study also postulates that this curvilinear relationship varies depending on the firm- and industry-specific human capital of outside directors. 467 firm-year observations collected from a randomly selected sample of large public firms from high-tech industries between 2005 and 2010 largely provide empirical support for these arguments. The findings contribute to the corporate governance literature by refining the understanding of the costs and benefits associated with board monitoring. The curvilinear relationship reported herein may also help reconcile prior inconsistent findings. The results also contribute to board capital theory by emphasizing the role of outside directors' firm-specific human capital in the context of R&D investments. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this article, we aim to study the impact on dividends policy of gender diversity on the board of directors (hereinafter BD). We hypothesize that the proportion of women directors, the proportion of independent, institutional, and executive female directors, and the percentage of shares held by female directors on BD, have an impact on the dividends policy of Spanish companies. Our findings, analyzing the whole sample, show that the proportion of female directors and shares held by female directors are positively associated with dividend payout, while the percentage of institutional female directors has a negative impact. The percentage of independent and executive female directors has no effect on dividend payout. When companies with losses are removed from the sample, the findings report that the percentage of female directors on BD and the percentage of independent female directors impact positively on dividend policy, while the percentage of institutional and executive female directors has a negative effect. The proportion of shares held by female directors on BD does not have an effect on dividend payout when only companies with profits are examined. Thus, the results confirm that gender diversity has an influence on dividend payout, so the existing legislation should encourage more participation by women in governing bodies. Our evidence supports the Act for Effective Equality between Women and Men, which establishes that listing companies have to achieve a quota of 40% of women in decision-making bodies by 2015.

Purpose: Board interlocks are a phenomenon of widespread prevalence and one of the most vibrant topics in corporate governance research. However, despite sustained academic interest in interlocks, there has not been a comprehensive review of the literature in nearly two decades. To address this need for an up-to-date review, this paper aims to conduct an assessment and integration of the empirical research on board interlocks. Design/methodology/approach: In reviewing the board interlocks literature, the "systematic review" approach, which emphasizes methodological rigor and transparency, has been used. Using this method, 81 empirical papers that became the focus of this analysis have been identified. Findings: This review reveals that board interlocks research can be categorized based on the theoretical lens used, its focus on antecedents or outcomes of interlock activities and the perspective of the study (i.e. firm- or director-level). Moreover, a number of commonly examined themes have been identified. Several unexpected omissions in the literature have also been uncovered. For instance, it was found that scholars have neither examined the implications of engaging in interlocks in a global context nor have they explored the phenomenon of international interlocks (i.e. interlocks between firms located in different countries). Originality/value: In developing a deeper understanding of the board interlocks literature, this review identifies several topics and disciplines that, if pursued, could enrich the literature and open promising avenues for future research.

Chinese listed companies have a two-tier (dual) governance structure that comprises a supervisory board/committee (SB) and the board of directors (BoD). However, as there is no hierarchical relationship between them, the two boards are independent. This is different from the governance mechanism in Continental Europe in which the SB appoints the directors of the management board; in this sense, the Chinese two-tier governance structure is unique. We investigate the impact of governance characteristics and ownership structure on gender diversity of both the BoD and the SB for a sample of 892 Chinese Initial Public Offerings floated in both the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges. We find that the average proportion of female directors and female SB members on the BoD and the SB are 10 and 22 %, respectively. Using both static and dynamic panel data methods, we find that there is no significant impact of board structure on gender diversity in China. However, we find a positive and significant relationship between SB size and gender diversity. We also find that the higher the state ownership, the lower the female representation on both boards. Finally, our findings show that there is a bi-directional relationship between financial performance and the proportion of female directors sitting on the BoD.

Research summary: We examine how board members' reactions following financial misconduct differ from those following other adverse organizational events, such as poor performance. We hypothesize that inside directors and directors appointed by the CEO may be particularly concerned about their reputation following deceptive financial practices. We demonstrate that directors more closely affiliated with the CEO are more likely to reduce their support for the CEO following financial misconduct, increasing the likelihood of CEO replacement. Enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act similarly alters governance dynamics by creating a greater expectation for sound corporate governance. We demonstrate our findings in U.S. public firms that restated their financial earnings during a 12-year period before and after the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley. Managerial summary: Given past concerns about lack of oversight by boards of directors leading to firm financial misconduct, we examine how the relationship between directors and CEOs may be altered in the face of such misconduct. We argue that directors most closely tied to the CEO (inside board members and board members appointed by the CEO), typically the most supportive of the CEO, may become most concerned about their own reputation following financial misconduct. We find that CEOs receive less support from these directors, a finding in contrast to past studies demonstrating that such board members tend to shield CEOs following poor performance. These findings are accentuated following the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which places greater responsibility on the CEO for the accuracy of financial reports.

Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the impact of women on the board of directors on corporate tax avoidance in Australia. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use multivariate regression analysis to test the association between the presence of female directors on the board and tax aggressiveness. They also test for self-selection bias in the regression model by using the two-stage Heckman procedure. Findings - This paper finds that relative to there being one female board member, high (i.e. greater than one member) female presence on the board of directors reduces the likelihood of tax aggressiveness. The results are robust after controlling for self-selection bias and using several alternative measures of tax aggressiveness. Research limitations/implications - This study extends the extant literature on corporate governance and tax aggressiveness. This study is subject to several caveats. First, the sample is restricted to publicly listed Australian firms. Second, this study only examines the issue of women on the board of directors and tax aggressiveness in the context of Australia. Practical implications - This research is timely, as there has been increased pressure by government bodies in Australia and globally to develop policies to increase female representation on the board of directors. Originality/value - This study is the first to provide empirical evidence concerning the association between the presence of women on the board of directors and tax aggressiveness.

We advance the literature on the demographic factors that shape organizational outcomes by analyzing the impact of the gender composition of firm leadership on the likelihood that a firm will adopt lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT)-friendly policies. Drawing on social role and token theory, we test the relative impact of CEO gender and the gender composition of the board of directors separately and together in order to identify the effects of gender diversity at the top of the organization. We rely on a unique data set that includes corporate policies (gender identity and sexual orientation non-discrimination policies, domestic-partner benefits, and overall corporate equality index scores) as well as the gender of the CEO and board of directors among Fortune 500 firms over a 10-year period. Our findings suggest that firms with gender-diverse boards are more likely than other firms to offer LGBT-friendly policies, whereas findings for firms with women CEOs offer mixed results.

Research summary: We develop a theory to explain why new outside CEOs can better manage their relationship with the board if they previously served on boards that were more diverse than the focal board. We predict that a new outside CEO's prior experience with more diverse boards not only reduces the likelihood of post-succession CEO turnover and director turnover, but also improves firm performance. Results from an analysis of 188 outside CEOs in a sample of Fortune 500 companies provide support for our theory. This study contributes to upper echelon theory and research by identifying outside CEOs' prior experience with board diversity as an important aspect of their background that influences a range of major organizational outcomes, including CEO turnover, director turnover, and firm performance. Managerial summary: It is challenging to be a new CEO who comes from outside of the organization. Our study examines why some new outside CEOs fare better than others. We suggest that a positive relationship with the board of directors is a key factor in a new outside CEO's success. A new outside CEO can better manage the relationship with the board if he or she has prior experience working with other demographically diverse boards. In contrast, when the focal board is more diverse than the other boards on which the new CEO previously served, the new CEO tends to struggle in managing his or her relationship with the board, experiencing a higher likelihood of turnover and delivering worse financial performance.

Recent research on the actual behaviour of boards suggests that more attention should be given to group dynamics in boards of directors. Therefore, we investigate if faultlines are detrimental to the role performance of boards of directors in family firms. In contrast to previous studies that only focus on one attribute, we use a more encompassing measure of faultlines, which is based on three attributes simultaneously (family-membership, type of directorship, and gender). Furthermore, we investigate the moderating role of formal board evaluation. Findings suggest a negative relationship between faultlines and both board control and service role performance. Interestingly, our study indicates that in boards that use formal evaluations, the negative effect of faultlines on control role performance is reversed. We discuss implications for faultline theory and research on boards of directors. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd

This study examines the impact of board decision processes on board task performance in family firms, contingent upon the presence of a family or a non-family CEO. Bridging insights from behavioral research on boards and the upper echelons perspective, it is suggested that influence of board decision processes on performance benefits from different aspects of CEO attributes. To the extent that family and non-family CEOs exhibit different cognitive frames, it is hypothesized that board processes contribute differently to board task performance, depending on whether a family or a non-family CEO is at the helm. An empirical analysis of a sample of Italian family firms provides support for two hypothesized effects: Use of knowledge and skills is more beneficial for board task performance under a non-family CEO; cognitive conflict is more beneficial under a family CEO. Contrary to expectations, the effects of effort norms do not differ between the two settings. This study contributes to research on both boards and family firms; new opportunities for advancements are discussed. (c) 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Although corporate governance researchers have devoted considerable attention to the role of boards of directors in monitoring management and providing resources, less attention has been paid to whether and how they affect the strategic actions of firms in response to changing environments. Taking a process-based perspective, we examine how several prevalent board processes (i.e., board meetings, outside-board-meeting reviewws and information utilization) affect the involvement of boards in strategic decision-making and how such involvement shapes organizational performance. Moreover, we offer an initial attempt to compare the strategic role of boards in for-profit and non-profit organizations. An investigation of 217 for-profit and 156 non-profit organizations in Canada indicates that different processes lead boards to different levels of strategic involvement, and that such effects are contingent on the types of organizations concerned. Moreover, boards that are active in strategic decision-making enhance the performance of their organizations. Our findings have implications for board research and practice.

This study examines how R&D investment is shaped by governance devices. Combining the two agency models of limited competence and managerial opportunism, it suggests that governance devices exert differing effects, in early vs. later stages of CEO tenure. Early in CEO tenure, R&D investment is reduced by stock options and board independence, whereas in later stages these effects reverse: R&D investment is enhanced by stock options and board independence. An empirical test on a sample of U.S. companies provides support for the hypothesized effects. For policy makers, this study implies that R&D investment can be enhanced by setting rules and standards of good governance that take into account CEO time in office and firm context.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to define the contribution of intellectual capital (IC) of the board of directors (BDs) in generating IC of a company, to develop a definition of the IC of the BDs, as well as two of its major elements: human capital (knowledge, skills, and experience of board members, etc.), and social capital (relationships and networking opportunities of board members), and to clarify the relationship between these elements and financial performance indicators of companies based on a literature review on the topic. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review and analysis was applied as this study's research design. Findings: The authors suggest that IC is generated not only by company staff, but also by governing bodies, particularly the BDs, whose members are not always under contract with the company in the traditional sense. Members of the board use their knowledge, experience, and networking opportunities to build IC for effective monitoring, advising, and providing the company with resources. In this sense, the BDs serves as a source of IC for a company, being the main internal corporate governance mechanism that leads to value creation in a company, taking into consideration the interests of all stakeholders. Practical implications: The research indicates that the personal characteristics of board members may influence the performance of a company. Therefore, companies should be recommended to carefully select candidates for nomination to the board. Originality/value: This study contributes to further development of the concept of IC of the BDs by bringing together the theory in the field and the empirical results of studies on the various elements of board capital in a company's value creation.

Manuscript type: Empirical. Research question/issue: We empirically examine the antecedents of shareholder activism related to increasing the gender diversity of corporate boards of directors and whether such activism is an effective mechanism for achieving this goal. Because campaigns for increased gender diversity may be driven by either economic efficiency or social legitimacy concerns, we condition our analysis on activists' motivations for achieving their objectives. Research findings/insights: Based on a sample of US S&P 1500 firms over 1997-2011, we find that female board representation and board independence are negatively associated with the likelihood of being targeted by a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity. We further document that financially motivated activists are more likely to target firms with extremely low female board representation than are socially motivated activists. Targeted firms significantly increase their female board representation in the two-year period following proposal initiation, relative to that of a matched sample of non-targeted firms, with no significant differences observed across activist motivations. Theoretical/academic implications: Our findings provide empirical support for the effectiveness of shareholder activism in shaping corporate governance. Our work also suggests that shareholder activists' underlying motivations are an important conditioning variable in governance research, with both agency theory and institutional theory providing insight into differing motivations. Practitioner/policy implications: Our findings suggest that shareholder proposals are an effective mechanism for increasing board diversity, irrespective of activist motivations. However, we note that mean female board representation for both targeted and non-targeted firms remains far below the level of representation sought by various activist groups. For policy-makers, this suggests that legislative action may be necessary to achieve these corporate board diversity goals in the US. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

New ventures often form a formal board of directors for the first time at the initial public offering (IPO). The tumult of external changes places a premium on rapid decision making within a resource-constrained venture. According to the social psychological theory, group consensus and decision alternatives serve as two key drivers for making rapid decisions. Therefore, based on signaling theory, the valuation from investors at the IPO depends on the observable signals that can imply the group consensus and decision alternatives in a board. We argue and test the hypothesis that, when group consensus and decision alternative signals are jointly considered, the relationship between the ratio of founders on the board and the IPO price premium will have an inversed U shape. In addition, we analyze how three contextual factors (original chief executive officer [CEO], founders' ownership, and venture capitalist [VC] on the board) can influence their signal consistency with founder directors on group consensus and decision alternatives, which ultimately changes the pattern of the inverted U shape. Based on a unique sample of 274 Chinese new venture IPOs over the period from 2004 to 2009, our results show that if the firm is managed by a nonoriginal CEO, the relationship between the founder-board ratio and the IPO price premium is an inverse U shape. Furthermore, if a VC sits on the board, the presence of founder directors has a linear positive effect on IPO premium; otherwise, the inverse U-shaped relationship still holds.

The purpose of this paper is to present and develop a firmer grasp of the underlying dimensions of organizational capacity in nonprofit human service organizations. The paper draws on the resource-based view of the organization (Barney et al. in Journal of Management 37:1299, 2011; Wernerfelt in Strategic Management Journal 5:171, 1984), which recognizes that organizational attributes and capabilities facilitate performance. Interviews were conducted with 66 executives in moderate sized, human service organizations to discuss factors that influence performance. Findings suggest that human, financial, and social capital all contribute to organizational performance. Executives emphasized the quality of people associated with the organization including the role of the board of directors in supporting performance. Many respondents also believed that maintaining healthy and dynamic external relationships was critical to success.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the influence of information and knowledge exchange and sharing between managers and non-executive directors is important in assessing the dynamic processes of accountability in boardrooms. By analysing information/knowledge at multiple levels, invoking the literature on implicit/tacit and explicit information/knowledge, the authors show that information asymmetry is a necessary condition for effective boards. The authors introduce a conceptual model of manager-non-executive director information asymmetry as an outcome of the interpretation of information/knowledge-sharing processes amongst board members. The model provides a more nuanced agenda of the management-board information asymmetry problem to enable a better understanding of the role of different types of information in practice. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis of information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation and the resultant conceptual model are based on the following elements: manager-non-executive director information/knowledge, management-board information/knowledge and board dynamics and reciprocal processes converting implicit/tacit into explicit information/knowledge. Findings - The paper provides new insights into the dynamics of information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation between managers and non-executive directors (individual level)/between management and boards (group level). The authors characterise this as a two-way process, back-and-forth between managers/executive directors and non-executive directors. The importance of relative/experienced "ignorance" of non-executive directors is revealed, which the authors term the "information asymmetry paradox". Research limitations/implications - The authors set out key opportunities for developing a research agenda from the model based on prior research of knowledge conversion processes and how these may be applied in a boardroom setting. Practical implications - The model may assist directors in better understanding their roles and the division of labour between managers and non-executive directors from an information/knowledge perspective. Originality/value - The authors apply Ikujiro Nonaka's knowledge conversion framework to consider the transitioning from individual implicit personal to explicit shared information/knowledge, to understand the subtle processes at play in boardrooms influencing information/knowledge exchange, sharing and creation between managers and non-executive directors.

This study examines the remuneration of non-executive directors, examining individual monitoring characteristics and director capital in addition to firm characteristics. Using a large sample of FTSE All-Share non-executive directors from 2001 to 2012, we find that remuneration is positively linked to both directors' individual characteristics and firm characteristics. We find that director age, tenure, and network size are positively related to remuneration, suggesting that directors' ability to contribute to board decision-making and their set of resources are valued by firms. We find that director remuneration is negatively related to monitoring characteristics such as director independence, suggesting possible agency considerations, as effective monitors of top management are paid less. However, director ownership has a non-linear relationship with remuneration, and is substitutive at higher levels of ownership. We also observe that UK boards are relatively homogeneous, with few female directors and even fewer Chairmen, and find strong evidence of a gender gap in remuneration when examining inter- and intra-firm variations. Our findings have implications for regulators who seek to intervene in board appointments, as they indicate that firms do not necessarily value or reward resources brought by female or independent directors.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a review of the literature on the participation of women on Boards of Directors (BD). Design/methodology/approach - The authors review a body of literature (theoretical and empirical words) that analyzes the women's role on the BD of companies. The review allows the authors to bring together the theoretical foundations and the empirical findings of studies that have examined the influence of the engagement of women on BD on the business outcomes of the firms involved. Findings - There is no agreement on the results relating to the effect of the presence of women on these boards. Moreover, there is no well-defined theoretical basis to explain this relationship, making it necessary to use a multi-theoretical approach. Research limitations/implications - This study could be extended by including investigations of the intermediate variable between the composition of the BD and the business outcomes, thus enabling an analysis of the effects of different organizational variables on the economic and financial variables already studied. In addition, the authors propose a comparative study between different countries and between different kinds of companies. Originality/value - This paper highlights the controversy that exists over the significance of the involvement of women on the BD of companies. It also proposes the development of new lines of research to attempt to answer some of the questions that are raised by the diverse findings reported in the literature.

Purpose-By looking at both theoretical and empirical findings, this study aims to investigate whether gender diversity results in improved corporate governance and financial performance for companies. Design/methodology/approach-An analysis of the board composition of the Johannesburg Securities Exchange Top 40 companies as at 30 June 2013 and a comparison of the financial performance of the company were conducted. Findings-Female directors were found to make up, on average, 18.78 per cent of the board of directors, with the majority of these women being in non-executive positions. Women representation appears to influence company performance positively when using accounting-based measures of performance (such as return on assets and return on equity), but negatively when using market-based measures (such as Tobin's Q). The critical mass concept is also assessed and is found to have a positive effect. Originality/value-These findings are of relevance to the boards of directors adhering to corporate governance requirements by challenging the role of women on the board of directors, as well as that of investors and those in practice, to understand the current status of women representation.

This study examines the role of the top management team (TMT) and governance structures in the use of corporate venture capital (CVC) in firms that have recently undergone an initial public offering (IPO). The study is unique in that it sheds light on governance-related antecedents of strategic decision making in such firms. We integrate the insights of behavioral agency and upper echelon perspectives to develop our hypotheses. Our results show that in the presence of non-duality, a negative curvilinear relationship exists between TMT heterogeneity and the use of CVC. We also find that TMT heterogeneity and ownership motivate the use of CVC but only up to a certain threshold. Our findings contribute to the literatures of entrepreneurship and strategy.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine in greater depth the concept of "board capital", which the authors consider to be a bundle of three types of capital, and believe to be a clear antecedent of the board's ability to perform its roles, which have positive consequences for the firm's performance. Design/methodology/approach: Through 83 firms listed on The Madrid Stock Exchange during the period 2005-2010, the authors test empirically the relationships between different dimensions of board capital and firm performance, and specially how internal social capital moderates the relationships between board human capital and external social capital with firm performance. Findings: The results show that certain characteristics of human capital (average board tenure) and external social capital (directors' interlocks) are positively related to the firm performance. The empirical findings also indicate that the internal social capital, measured by board density, is positively related to the firm performance and moderates these above relationships, increasing the potential of the resources contributed by the board members and influencing to a large extent on a firm's performance. Practical implications: The results of the investigation will help both executives and scholar in two ways. First, they will assist firms when they have to select board members, as they can now understand how the resources that board members bring with them can affect the firm performance. To be more effective, boards need to have members that have experience as firm's directors, external connections to other boards and many internal ties among them. Second, in this context, internal social capital is especially relevant, so the firms should look for possible ways of encouraging internal ties between directors. In this paper, the authors have opted for study the participation of directors in committees. Originality/value: The authors propose that these three types of capital (human, external and internal social capital) need to be synergistically combined to create a group of directors with access to a complete set of skills, knowledge and connections, but which can still work as a compact social group when making decisions.

This paper examines the firm-level antecedents of Six Sigma adoption in Korea. Our results indicate that firms with top executives and board members having work experience in the foreign country where the focal management practice originated and was popularized are more likely to adopt this practice. Furthermore, firms' exposure to foreign investors exerts a direct effect and also moderates the impact of foreign work experience on adoption. Prior work experience in the country of practice origin reduces the uncertainty inherent in cross-border adoption by providing executives and board members with greater insight into the presumed benefits of the focal practice.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine whether board-related characteristics matter for cost efficiency in banking sector. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a sample of publicly traded US commercial banks and savings institutions to estimate a relationship between cost efficiency measured by stochastic frontier analysis and a set of board-related characteristics for the period 2007-2013. Findings: An inverted U-shape relation is found between board size and efficiency. Thus, there is a trade-off between costs and benefits of larger boards. Optimal board size is higher for banks with more complex operations. This study also observed an inverted U-shape relation between board independence and cost efficiency. The banks where the Chairman also executes the CEO responsibility show lower efficiency. However, a higher proportion of independent board members in banks with unitary leadership structure may mitigate the conflict of interest and lower efficiency stemming from CEO duality. Research limitations/implications: This study's evidence supports the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision emphasis on advising a board composition that provides for a sufficient degree of director independence. Practical Implications: The results are relevant for banks and their external and internal stakeholders. Banks may adjust their current board characteristics to increase the board effectiveness. Externally, potential investors can evaluate the quality of corporate governance of banks before making investment decisions. The empirical findings can also be useful for regulators imposing corporate governance codes in banking. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to provide empirical evidence on the impact of board characteristics on bank efficiency for a wide panel of US banks. Additionally, a comprehensive set of board-related variables is used. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to extend the current research on corporate philanthropy and organizational outcomes by empirically exploring two specific types of antecedents: board of director composition and industry membership. Design/methodology/approach - A theoretical framework was developed based on the resource dependence and stakeholder theories which suggest that the extent that firms build relationship with certain stakeholders is closely tied to the personal and social background of board members, in turn influencing the allocation of resources to corporate philanthropy. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis as well as analysis of variance with post hoc comparisons was conducted using multi-year data philanthropic data from 104 US corporations. Findings - The results provided empirical support for a positive relationship between the number of female board directors and the level of corporate philanthropy. In addition, the results showed significant inter-industry variations in the level of corporate philanthropy. This indicated that the rather aggressive role of philanthropy in mitigating reputational challenges associated with product-market dysfunctions. Contrary to the theoretical predictions, the results did not support a positive relationship between the proportion of outside directors and level of philanthropy. Research limitations/implications - The authors believe the empirical finding on the relationship between industry membership and corporate philanthropy is a significant contribution to the philanthropy literature. Accordingly, by empirically showing the disproportionately higher level of philanthropy by some prominent industries (such as gas and oil, financial services and chemical) than their counterparts, the authors contribute to the understanding of sector-level determinants of corporate philanthropy. Practical implications - Since board of directors have a direct involvement in reviewing and approving major corporate initiatives, the choice of these directors is more likely to influence the amount of resources committed to philanthropic causes. Consistent with other studies in the larger corporate social responsibility research, the authors found that more women directors on the board are associated with greater philanthropic spending. Hence, a major implication of the study is that shareholders and the general corporate community need to pay close attention into who is elected to serve as director of business organizations as these directors' background and experience could shape major social responsibility initiatives such as corporate philanthropy. Originality/value - By empirically investigating the relationship between board composition and philanthropy, this study extends the scholarly discussion to focus on the role of the board in shaping the level of firm commitment in overall CSR. In addition, this study provides empirical evidence on the role of industry context in the level of commitment in corporate philanthropic activities. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This study presents evidence of the influence of gender diversity on the pay system and the monitoring of executives in Spain. In this country/context, characterized by a few male dominant shareholders acting simultaneously as executives, there is an ongoing discussion regarding the enactment of laws to promote gender equality on the boards of directors of large listed companies. This paper presents several contributions. On the one hand, the scarce previous evidence on this topic is focused on US firms. On the other hand, this study includes the role of ownership structure as a factor that indirectly moderates the relationships between gender diversity on board and monitoring effectiveness in terms of executive directors' compensation. Furthermore, this paper makes an important effort to control endogeneity. The sample examined includes 120 companies listed on the Spanish stock market during the period 2004-2011. The results show a positive and highly significant effect of the presence of women independent directors on the proportion of variable pay in the compensation of executive directors. Our findings also point out the negative moderating effect of ownership concentration: the more concentrated is ownership in the hands of internal majority shareholder, the less is the link between board diversity and pay-for-performance systems.

In this study, we examine how board characteristics, such as the independent director ratio, board size, and the number of interlocks, influence the investment of slack resources into research and development (R&D) by a firm. Both the agency theory and resource dependence theory predict a positive influence of independent director ratio on the financial slack-R&D investment relationship. However in the case of board size and number of interlocks, resource dependence theory argues for a positive moderating effect, while agency theory predicts a negative effect. The hypotheses are tested on the seven-year panel data of 172 firms in the Indian pharmaceutical industry, an emerging economy, high technology industry. We find broad support for the resource provisioning role of the board of directors, which is attributed to the emerging economy context of the Indian pharmaceutical industry, where firms face high levels of opportunity but lack resources to make use of them effectively.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper was first to find out whether the negative relationship between board size and future firm risk persists in China while contemplating all sorts of endogeneity. Second, the authors have investigated the role of large shareholders in influencing the managerial decisions concerning future firm risk via board size. Finally, the authors examined whether the moderating role of large shareholders is any different in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-state-owned enterprises (NSOEs) in China. Design/methodology/approach: The sample included all the A-listed firms listed on the Shanghai and the Shenzhen stock exchanges over a sample period from 2008 to 2013. The authors used fixed effects regression and the generalized method of moments (GMM) to test the three hypotheses. Findings: The authors found that board size is negatively associated with future firm risk when measured as volatility in future stock prices and future cash flows. Second, large shareholders directly influence managerial decisions about future firm risk, irrespective of board size. Third, the moderating role of ownership concentration is insignificant in both SOEs and NSOEs. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study which has analyzed the role of large shareholders in the relationship between board size and future firm risk. This study provides valuable insights, particularly in the context of a developing country, into the role played by large shareholders in influencing managerial decisions concerning future firm risk.

In theory, nonprofit boards of directors exist to perform mission-setting and oversight functions that help to ensure organizational accountability. Yet there is evidence that board behavior often falls short of this ideal. Using survey data from a sample of 241 executive directors of nonprofit agencies, we investigated whether nonprofit boards are meeting executive directors' expectations, and if not, what factors explain this? We find that although board behavior tends to align closely with executive directors' preferences for involvement in administration and management tasks, there is a greater disconnect between board behavior and executive directors' preferences for involvement in mission-setting and oversight duties. Factors that mitigate this gap include organizational professionalization and stability, whereas more extensive reliance on government funding exacerbates it. Female executive directors experience a greater disconnect in their preferences for board involvement and actual board involvement than male executive directors. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for both theory and practice. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Research summary: The formation of interorganizational ties is a consequential phenomenon examined in strategic management research. Beckman, Haunschild, and Phillips (2004) is one of the first studies to comprehensively consider interorganizational network change by exploring factors that affect both alliance and board interlock formation. They find that firm-specific uncertainty relates to broadening actions, whereas market-level uncertainty causes firms to reinforce current structures. Our replication considers whether these relationships operate similarly in a differing temporal context. Building from the framework of the original study, we suggest our findings offer intriguing new empirical evidence highlighting the importance of time as a boundary condition in understanding embedded firm actions. Managerial summary: The development of interorganizational relationships, such as alliances and ties between boards of directors, has an important impact on innovation, strategic actions, and firm performance. This study examines whether the dynamics of interorganizational relationship formation remain consistent over time. We replicate earlier work by Beckman and colleagues (2004), but with an expanded data set covering more than 20 years. Over this broader time horizon, we find a shift in behavior, with companies facing firm-specific uncertainty seeking to reinforce their current relationships and companies facing industry-wide uncertainty seeking to diversify their risk by expanding their network. Our results demonstrate the importance of replication studies in research and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complexity surrounding interorganizational relationships.

The growing importance of board diversity among directors has been established as a result of global financial crisis in 2008. According to the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance 2012, nominating committee shall be responsible to select directors with diverse background that meet the needs of the company. This paper attempts to examine the impacts of having female directors in a nomination committee on gender diversity on board. For this purpose, 393 (50%) non-financial Malaysian listed companies were selected for the three year period of 2011 to 2013. Results indicated that having female directors in a nomination committee is significantly related to the level of gender diversity on board. The results also signify the importance to have female directors in nomination committee as it will influence gender diversity on board. (c) 2016 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to empirically assess the effect, if any, of family ownership and busy boards on companies' Tobin's Q and cash holdings in France. Design/methodology/approach - Using a multiple regression analysis for panel data, the author investigate the impacts of being family-owned and of multiple directorships on cash holdings and then on Tobin's. Findings - Family ownership seems to have no significant effect. The most significant finding is that family-owned companies are smaller and work in the manufacturing and construction sectors compared to non-family-owned companies. However, multiple directorship is not negatively related to firm performance in France. Research limitations/implications - The current study focusses solely on France, which, even though different from the more usual American perspective, is not enough to make broad generalizations. It is however, a useful step toward better understanding the issues at hand. International data on family firms and busy boards, while hard to come by, would further enhance the knowledge of corporate governance. Originality/value - It is interesting to know if family-owned companies and those with multiple directorships perform differently from others, especially in a context where organizations can choose between a one-tier or two-tier system of governance, as is the case in France.

The question of whether a "good" corporate board structure can optimize performance and minimize conflicts between managers and shareholders has been widely debated. Because mergers and acquisitions represent major managerial investment decisions that are subject to board scrutiny, the effectiveness of a board's structure is especially visible in the context of corporate acquisitions. With that in mind, in this paper, we examine the abundant literature in the fields of strategic management, economics, and finance in order to identify which board attributes contribute to the ability of corporate boards to create value through mergers and acquisitions. In particular, we discuss the impact of four board attributes: (1) board independence, (2) board size and director-specific attributes, (3) board ownership and compensation, (4) multiple directorships. As a result of our analysis, we conclude that the impact of board attributes on shareholder wealth in mergers and acquisitions is specific to each firm. Therefore, board regulations that do not reflect a firm's specific needs may in fact hinder the creation of a board that is capable of responding effectively to the firm's unique needs and circumstances.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate board director disciplinary and cognitive influence on corporate value creation. Design/methodology/approach: Fixed-effect regressions are used to check whether gender diversity, education, independence and size of the board of directors affect measures of corporate value creation. Findings: The empirical results show that corporate value creation is positively influenced by the cross effect of the board independence and the presence of women. They also point out a positive impact of the cross effect of board independence and management education. They reveal that the board of directors contributes significantly to corporate value creation, particularly when there is a mix of independent, female and management-qualified directors. Originality/value: The evidence presented and discussed in this paper should be of interest to managers and regulators. The methodological approach and the empirical results extend the existing literature. They enrich the limited empirical research devoted to this theme, especially in a continental European context, i.e. France. They shed light on the effect of board of directors' disciplinary and cognitive influence on corporate value creation. (c) 2016, (c) Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

This paper examines the effects of board quality on the relationship between corporate bankruptcy and nomination committee effectiveness. We argue that the proportion of outside directors, a proxy of board quality, arguably captures the extent of board control and resources. Based on dataset from 1835 firm-year observations for 98 bankrupt and 269 non-bankrupt UK listed non-financial firms between 1994 and 2011 and using the agency and resource dependence theories, we predict and find that nomination committee effectiveness negatively affects corporate bankruptcy and that board quality mitigates the negative effects. The results lend support to the notion that firms benefit from board quality in terms of outside directors' ability to monitor CEO on behalf of shareholders and also provide advice, counsel and legitimacy to the firm. This study extends the present research on corporate bankruptcy by providing evidence on the impact of board quality and nomination committee effectiveness on UK corporate bankruptcy.

In countries with weak institutions, board governance becomes more important. This study uses a unique dataset from listed sub-Saharan African companies to examine the relationship between ownership composition and board compensation. It further analyses the association between board compensation and company performance. The findings indicate that board ownership and chief executive officer ownership are positively associated, whereas state ownership and concentrated ownership are negatively associated with board compensation. There is no evidence of a significant association between chairperson ownership or foreign ownership and board compensation. Finally, there is a negative but not significant relationship between board compensation and company performance.

Quasi-Governmental Organizations (QGOs) are organizations that have both public and private characteristics, not fitting neatly into either category. One type of QGO is an organization incorporated as a private, nonprofit organization, but run by a board of directors that is composed of government officials or directors appointed by a unit of traditional government. These QGOs pose distinct conceptual and policy challenges that differ from those of traditional government entities or purely private nonprofits. Drawing on a convenience sample of five such QGOs incorporated in one metropolitan region (Greater Cleveland, Ohio), this piece explores potential reasons for, and possible pitfalls of, mixing private organizational legal status with public-affiliated leaders by developing a framework and proposing a research agenda for future study.

Purpose - The chapter builds on the literature of Agency and Signalling Theories to analyse the corporate governance factors associated with the voluntary decision to prepare an Integrated Report according to the International Framework promoted by the IIRC. Methodology/approach - The chapter is based on the results of a probit regression run with regard to a sample of 35 companies that joined the Pilot Programme in 2011 and 137 similar companies that did not. Findings - The analysis of two samples of European companies reveals that adhesion to the IR Pilot Programme is positively related to the gender diversity and size of the board. Research limitations - Further research is required in order to study the differences between listed and non-listed companies in terms of variables affecting the adoption of the Framework and to increase the time range of our study. In addition, it would be interesting to include other variables capturing different aspects other than corporate governance, since the decision to join the Programme, as the results of our analysis have shown, may also be influenced by other factors, such as strategy decisions and communication policies. Originality/value - The chapter adds to the existing literature by showing the main governance characteristics that impact the decision to adhere to the IR Pilot Programme. It is also important to the existing literature regarding the role played by gender diversity in corporate governance mechanisms and CSR policies.

A code of corporate governance was introduced in Sweden in 2005. Although the code is mandatory, a company is allowed to override specific rules if it openly discloses the deviation and explains why it does not comply. The aim of this study is to explain how the governance structure, operationalized as the ownership structure, the board and the auditor, affects companies' propensity to deviate from the Swedish Code. The empirical data in this study are based on the 2010 annual reports from 193 companies listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange and data from the Swedish Corporate Governance Board. The findings show that concentrated ownership, smaller boards with directors with long tenure and audit firms with a high proportion of employees compared with partners increase the likelihood of deviance.

Initiation and support from boardrooms are factors that are important to a Taiwanese firm's ability to change its strategic orientation from manufacturing to branding. We examine whether board members' educational backgrounds contribute to firms' branding success. We find that firms are more likely to be successful in brand development when their board members have been educated at top-ranked universities, foreign universities, and top MBA programs. The results are more robust when branding is successful at a global rather than a domestic level. Our argument is further supported by the finding that the educational background of board members is more relevant for branding success in industries with more mature branding practices.

As the civil society and corporatism theories have been frequently challenged recently, alternative theories emerged to investigate the government-ngo relationship in China. Some new theories are largely related to resource dependence or share core ideas with it. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of the resource dependence theory. It identifies four groups of variables (organizational characteristics, board of directors, attitude and value, and external environment), finds support for their relevance from both Western and China scholarship, and applies them to the Chinese context. The resource dependence theory has the potential of empirically examining the relationship without over-focusing on the state or society. It is capable of explaining the dynamic and diverse relationships between the government and various ngos in China. (c) 2016 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the evolution of corporate governance in Nigeria and how the duplication of code of corporate best practices is impacting compliance with the key recommendations of these guidelines. The issues of corporate governance and reforms especially those related to the development and implementation of code of corporate best practices have been a subject of academic discuss over the years with more research emphasis placed on developed economies. This paper intends to add the sub-Sahara Africa and the emerging economic perspective to this vibrant stream of research. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts an explanatory approach in the review of the four different codes of corporate governance that were issued in Nigeria in the past ten years. Findings: The paper demonstrated that corporate governance has been a fundamental issue of concern in Nigerian public enterprises since the country gained independence in 1960. The paper equally established that the application of recent corporate governance reforms has been challenged, not on competency grounds but rather by the proliferation of codes which have created implementation and monitoring difficulties for both the affected firms and the regulatory agencies. Originality/value: Unlike other previous studies, this paper offers comprehensive analysis of corporate governance evolution in Nigeria and found through documented literatures that shortage of experienced local personnel and the absence of effective external control mechanisms have been the bane against the development of corporate governance in Nigeria. The originality of this paper also lies in being the first paper to have linked developments in the public enterprises to the renewed focus on corporate governance. This is the most inclusive paper to have identified key implications of multiplicity of corporate governance codes and the direct application of governance system within the context of the country's socio-cultural distinctiveness.

Despite extensive research on the internationalization-performance relationship, our understanding of the role of board of directors in the internationalization of emerging-market firms remains relatively limited. In addition, research pertaining to the board's influence on firm performance has tended to focus more on board content than on its processes. In an attempt to address this research gap, we study the contingent role of the board's capabilities on the relationship between internationalization and performance, in emerging-market firms. We propose that board tenure will have a negative moderating effect, whereas board members' experience as CEO or general manager, industry-specific experience, international experience, and level of academic achievement will have positive moderating effects. We argue that, in the context of emerging market firms, board interactions are particularly important, and propose that moderate levels of board interaction will be most beneficial for the internationalizationperformance relationship.

In the aftermath of the Asian Financial crisis in 1997/1998, the Malaysia Securities Commission (SC) issued the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance in 2000 (MCCG 2000). It was subsequently revised in 2007 following the Enron and Transmile debacles. In 2012, the SC issued the latest MCCG 2012 which introduced several new recommendations that are in line with developments in other parts of the world. Hence, the purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of the structure of the board and its activities on firm performance post MCCG 2007. The study also aims to shed light on the effectiveness of the board of directors since the issuance of MCCG 2000 and of MCCG 2007. It also aims to reveal the preparedness of listed firms in Malaysia to embrace MCCG 2012. Using a population of non-finance listed firms for the 2009, 2010 and 2011 financial years, it was found that board independence, chief executive officer (CEO) duality, directors' busyness, nomination committee independence, the establishment of a risk management committee (RMC) and board meetings are not associated with firm performance, i.e. Tobin's q. However, the market appears to be in favour of a larger board size. As for return on assets (ROA), it is not associated with board independence, board size, directors' busyness and nomination committee independence. On the other hand CEO duality and the establishment of a RMC improve ROA, while board meetings are detrimental to ROA. It can therefore be concluded that board independence is not associated with either Tobin's q or ROA. Hence, any corporate governance reforms should not over-emphasize the representation of independent directors on the board, rather the focus might be shifted to board activities, such as board meetings and the establishment of a RMC. With regard to board size, since the market is in favour of a larger board size, firms should increase the board's size to enable the appointment of women directors to the board. Finally, combining the CEO and board chairman roles should not be disallowed as the market views this favourably. Hence, the 'one-hat approach' does not appear to be applicable in the case of CEO duality. (c) 2016, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

Committees on a board of directors are now subject to recommendations by regulations in practically all jurisdictions. At the same time, scholarly work on the topic has escalated since the mid-1990s. In this review article, we examine relevant literature on board committees of audit, compensation and nomination, as part of corporate governance research in general, over the period of 1988 to 2011. We observed an exponential growth in contributions over time, the majority of which can be attributed to management and accounting scholars. The audit committee is the most researched of all three committees, with the nomination committee being the least researched. An analysis of the literature generated a picture that included the following features: 1) the dominance of the agency theory; 2) a lack of other unifying theoretical frameworks; 3) a strong US-centrism; 4) the prevalence of quantitative research methods.

The governance structure and financial performance of organizations have the potential to support the strategic direction of organizations in embedding social and environmental initiatives into their business activities. This is because CSR initiatives require top management commitment and support from stakeholders. In addition, the availability of financial resources could further enhance the CSR initiatives and influence strategic development. The aim of this study is to examine the influence of governance structure (specifically ownership and board structure) and financial performance on CSR reporting among Malaysian public-listed companies. The agency and signaling theories have been employed to underpin the theoretical perspectives of the study. The data for this research was sourced from content analyses of both the annual and sustainability reports of the top 100 public-listed Malaysian companies. The study reveals that board independence, board size, and the presence of women directors on the board significantly influence the reporting of CSR information. Nonetheless, government and foreign ownerships were not significant determinants of the reporting practice. In terms of financial performance, profitability was found to be significant in signaling the behavior of companies to disclose CSR information. Overall, the results of the study largely imply that board structure and profitability of organizations are critical towards the enhancement of CSR initiatives of companies. Social implications: Findings of this study indicate the positive role of women directors on the extent of CSR disclosure, which encourages diversity in the board of directors.

This paper seeks to provide a better understanding of what makes boards effective. We analyse the relationships between board demography and company performance and between working structures and board tasks in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We test our hypotheses on a sample of 307 Spanish SMEs. The main empirical result is the negative impact that the proportion of outside directors and the board size have on firm performance. We also find a negative impact of outsiders' presence and a positive impact of director tenure on the board's service role. Our analysis of the role of board control highlights the negative relationship between this variable and CEO tenure.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze certain organizational changes that occur after privatization. More specifically, the authors analyze from an agency theory perspective how changes at the corporate governance level (ownership type/structure and board of directors) influence firm strategy, and what implications these issues have for the design of compensation mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology employed in the study can be described as a longitudinal multiple case study approach. A multiple case study enables the comparison of pre- and post-privatization periods in five Spanish companies. This methodology is especially suitable to track the organizational changes occurring in relation to the firms' internal management. Findings - First, the variables that traditionally relate to greater board independence in monitoring do not suffer from variation after privatization. Second, the interests of the firms' new ownership have an impact on firm strategy after privatization. Finally, compensation system design clearly aligns with firm strategy after privatization. Research limitations/implications - The research is based on a multiple case study approach, which limits the scope and generalizability of the findings. Originality/value - Whereas research in privatization generally adopts a macroeconomic or political perspective, organizational and managerial implications are current aspects in need of further examination. This research offers a study that integrates three sets of variables (corporate governance, strategy and compensation) that have been rarely analyzed in this context.

The aim of this paper is to determine to what extent globalization pressures are changing interlocking directorate networks modeled on continental capitalism into Anglo-Saxon models. For this purpose we analyse the Spanish network of interlocks, comparing the present structure (2012) with that of 1993 and 2006. We show how, although Spanish corporative structure continues to display characteristics of the continental economies, some major banks are significantly reducing industrial activity. Nevertheless, the financial organizations continue to maintain a close relationship with sectors such as construction and services. The analysis of the network of directorates shows a retreat in activity of industrial banking in Spain. Two large Spanish financial institutions, BSCH and La Caixa, continue to undertake activities of industrial banking in 2006, but this activity is significantly reduced in 2012. According to the theories on the role of the interlocking directorates, the companies in these sectors assure their access to banking credit by incorporating advisors from financial organizations to their board of directors. We cannot conclude that the structure of the Spanish corporate network has become a new case of Anglo-Saxon structure, but we got indications that are becoming less hierarchic as banks seem to slowly abandon centrality positions. This is especially salient if we compare the networks of 2006 and 2012, which show a continuing decrease of the role of banks and insurance companies in the network.

This article aims at assessing the influence of women in the board of directors (BOD) on risk management in Vietnamese firms. The study touches upon a sample of 284 companies listed on the HOSE (Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange - Vietnam) in the period of 2008-2014. Their data was regressed by the random effects model (REM) and the fixed effects model (FEM). To find out which method is the most appropriate, we used the Hausman test. The study clarifies women's role in society and the optimal ratio of women in the BOD to minimise risks at enterprises. The authors give recommendations to corporate managers regarding proper employment policies, in which the role of women is better recognised. The most valuable result of the presented research is a grounded finding of an optimal female ratio in the BOD recommended for the Vietnamese enterprises. In order to achieve a positive impact of women on the risks reduction at the enterprise, the suggested female ratio in the BOD should be 34.96%, which will help to keep the lowest risk exposure. Hence, it could be recommended to raise a number of women in the BODs to approximately 1/3 of the total amount of members. Business owners may take this into account when planning human resource policies to maximise business performance. (c) 2016 Institute of Society Transformation.

Corporate governance regulation has been through numerous cycles of reform, and yet we still see instances of companies collapsing suddenly. Codes of corporate governance have been implemented in most developed countries, recommending detailed governance frameworks for publicly listed companies and their boards, but our understanding of how these codes influence behaviour is still limited. In this book, Alice Klettner draws on the domains of law and business to explore the effectiveness of corporate governance codes. Using interview evidence from company directors and officers, as well as published evidence of companies' corporate governance systems, she discusses the theory and practice of corporate governance and its regulation - with a focus on how corporate governance codes can affect board behaviour and company performance. This interdisciplinary book will be valuable reading for advanced students and researchers of corporate governance, and will also be directly relevant to governance practitioners and policymakers.

The previous literature suggests that firms may use the characteristics of the board members as a signal for building their own image. The objective of this paper is to analyze whether the number of appointments of directors influences corporate reputation. For that, we focus on a sample of US firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for the period 2007-2010 and we examine a total of 30,813 directors. Our results indicate that there is a curvilinear relationship between the number of directorships of board members and corporate reputation. These findings shed some light on the value of boards of directors and also have implications for companies in the selection of board members. (c) 2016 Virtus Interpress, All rights reserved.

Well performed companies have always been linked with effective governance which is generally reflected through effective board of directors. However many issues concerning the attributes for effective board of directors remained unresolved. Nowadays diversity has been perceived as able to influence the corporate performance due to the likelihood of meeting variety of needs and demands from diverse customers and clients. The study therefore aims to provide a fundamental understanding on governance among high performing companies in Malaysia. (c) 2016, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.

This paper examines the relationship between board structure and risk taking behavior of emerging market firms by looking at firms' growth strategies in foreign as well as domestic markets. More specifically, we study the individual and joint effects of board structure, network centrality through board interlocks and ownership structure on firm's growth strategies. With the help of longitudinal data on 2152 publicly listed Indian firms from 2002 to 2009, we find that boards that are structured keeping in view the resource dependence role are more helpful in pursuing growth strategies. We find that firms having more independent board members and CEO duality are more likely to pursue growth through new domestic ventures or new foreign investments. Moreover, firms that are more central in the network of other firms, based on director interlocks, are more likely to pursue growth in domestic as well as international markets. Further we find that board independence interacts with network centrality and family ownership in affecting a firm's growth strategies. (c) 2017

Purpose: This study is guided by the upper echelon theory and argues that the role of females on boards of directors may differ between cultures. In a culture where the community has a significant humane orientation, female directors may pay much more attention to the social issues of corporate sustainability rather than environmental issues. Therefore, this study aims to differentiate between the social and environmental performances of companies to examine whether the presence of females on the boards of directors of Malaysian firms could affect social and environmental performances differently. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a sample of firms listed in Bursa Malaysia and develops two disclosure indices to measure social and environmental performances. Three proxies of female directors are used in the empirical models. The ordinary least square model is used to test the hypothesis. Findings: The empirical results suggest a positive association between social performance and the presence of female directors on the board of directors of Malaysian firms. However, no association was found between environmental performance and the presence of female directors on those boards. These results confirm the prediction of this study that the female directors of Malaysian firms pay more attention to social issues than to environmental ones. Originality/value: This is the first study to examine the effects of the presence of female directors on Malaysian firms' boards of directors on social and environmental performance. It also contributes to the upper echelon theory by illuminating the importance of gender diversity in influencing the social and environmental behaviors of corporate leaders. The results provide the important implication that the association between a firm's social and environmental performance and gender diversity depends on the culture within which the company operates.

Research summary: Does the degree to which founders keep control of their startups affect company value? I argue that founders face a "control dilemma" in which a startup's resource dependence drives a wedge between the startup's value and the founder's ability to retain control of decision making. I develop hypotheses about this tradeoff and test the hypotheses on a unique dataset of 6,130 American startups. I find that startups in which the founder is still in control of the board of directors and/or the CEO position are significantly less valuable than those in which the founder has given up control. On average, each additional level of founder control (i.e., controlling the board and/or the CEO position) reduces the pre-money valuation of the startup by 17.1-22.0 percent. Managerial summary: A founder's vision and capabilities are key ingredients in the early success of a startup. During those early days, it is natural for the founder to have a powerful, central role. However, as the startup grows, founders who keep too much control of the startup and its most important decisions can harm the value of the startup. Both qualitative case studies and quantitative analyses of more than 6,000 private companies highlight that startups in which the founder has maintained control (by retaining a majority of the board of directors and/or by remaining as CEO) have significantly lower valuations than those where the founder has relinquished control. This is especially true when the startup is three years old or more. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In the wake of the recent debt crisis in Europe, we investigate the influence of board diversity on financial fragility and performance of European banks. Corporate governance codes in Europe recommend unitary and dual-board systems; therefore, we believe that the influence of board diversity may vary across governance mechanisms and that no other studies have addressed these variations and their influence on financial fragility across European countries. The results show that a critical mass of female representation on both the supervisory board and the board of directors may reduce banks' vulnerability to financial crisis. However, interestingly, we find evidence that female directors on the management board are not risk averse. We argue that the degree of risk taking for female directors may vary based on their roles (non-executive or executive) and that female and male executive directors may have the same risk taking behaviour. Our empirical results provide guidelines to the regulators in Europe with respect to the recently approved proposal by the European Parliament on female representation. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This study aims to analyse the relationship between board gender diversity and firm financial performance in Italy, where the recently enforced Law 120/2011 prescribes gender quotas for boards of directors. Design/methodology/approach: Panel data analysis was used to examine the gender diversity-firm financial performance relationship in an unbalanced panel of 918 Italian listed companies during the years 2011-2014. Findings: Gender diversity, as measured by the percentage of women on a board and by the Blau and the Shannon indices, has a positive and significant effect on Tobin's Q, while the presence of one or more women on the board per se has an insignificant effect on firm financial performance. Practical implications: The results suggest that board gender diversity is not a simple "numbers game", greater gender diversity may generate economic gains, greater gender diversity does not destroy shareholder value, investors do not penalize companies that increase female representation on their boards and Italian companies should focus their efforts on the right mix of men and women rather than on simply the presence of at least one woman on a board of directors. Originality/value: Most articles on this topic use data from countries with a legal system based on common law; this paper analyses Italy, a country with a civil law system. This is almost certainly the first study to examine the effect of board gender diversity on firm financial performance in the Italian market. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper presents an empirical study of changes that firms implement in their board-level IT governance (ITG) upon experiencing operational IT failures. Consistent with the separation of oversight from management decisions, board-level ITG is responsible for monitoring managerial IT decisions and policies for controlling IT resources. We expect that operational IT failures indicating inadequacies in board monitoring of controls over IT resources would result in a negative stock market reaction and, in turn, induce firms to improve their board-level ITG. Our expectation is confirmed based on a sample of 110 operational IT failures from U.S. public financial firms. Specifically, our results demonstrate that subsequent to experiencing operational IT failures, firms make improvements to the IT competency level of their boards, and the improvements are proportional to the degree of negative market reaction. However, those improvements are only on the executive side of the board, namely: an increase in the IT experience of internal (executive) directors and an increased turnover rate of CIOs serving on the board. Furthermore, the likelihood of CIO turnover is lower in IT-intensive firms where such turnover could be more disruptive. Our results contribute to understanding the critical connection between operational IT failures and board-level ITG.

This study examines the impact of board of director gender diversity on corporate tax aggressiveness. Based on a sample of 418 U.S. firms covering the 2006-2009 period (1672 firm-year observations), our ordinary least squares regression results show a negative and statistically significant association between female representation on the board and tax aggressiveness after controlling for endogeneity. Our results are consistent across several measures of tax aggressiveness and additional robustness checks. (c) 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the joint effect of board independence and gender diversity on the effectiveness of boards in monitoring CEO compensation in a continental European context, i.e. France. Design/methodology/approach: Fixed-effect regressions are used to study the impact of board independence, gender diversity and their interaction, i.e. the proportion of female independent directors on the different components of CEO compensation (total, fixed and variable). Findings: The authors observe that both the proportions of independent directors and women sitting on the boards positively influence the various components of CEO compensation. However, the interaction of these factors, i.e. the proportion of female independent directors, is negatively associated with CEO compensation. These results suggest that independent women directors improve board effectiveness in monitoring CEO compensation, especially its fixed component. Originality/value: The results of this research help to elucidate the importance of women being appointed to boards as independent directors to properly monitor managerial pay. These results provide support to the approach of the French Cope-Zimmerman law of January 2011, which promotes female representation on boards as independent directors to enhance board decision-making. Thus, evidence presented and discussed in this paper should provide useful insights for academics, corporate managers and regulators. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Research summary: Corporate scandals of the previous decade have heightened attention on board independence. Indeed, boards at many large firms are now so independent that the CEO is "home alone" as the lone inside member. We build upon "pro-insider" research within agency theory to explain how the growing trend toward lone-insider boards affects key outcomes and how external governance forces constrain their impact. We find evidence among S&P 1500 firms that having a lone-insider board is associated with (a) excess CEO pay and a larger CEO-top management team pay gap, (b) increased likelihood of financial misconduct, and (c) decreased firm performance, but that stock analysts and institutional investors reduce these negative effects. The findings raise important questions about the efficacy of leaving the CEO "home alone.". Managerial summary: Following concerns that insider-dominated boards failed to protect shareholders, there has been a push for greater board independence. This push has been so successful that the CEO is now the only insider on the boards of more than half of S&P 1500 firms. We examine whether lone-insider boards do in fact offer strong governance or whether they enable CEOs to benefit personally. We find that lone-insider boards pay CEOs excessively, pay CEOs a disproportionately large amount relative to other top managers, have more instances of financial misconduct, and have lower performance than boards with more than one insider. Thus, it appears that lone-insider boards do not function as intended and firms should reconsider whether the push towards lone-insider boards is actually in shareholders' best interests.

Time plays an important role in corporate social responsibility (CSR) decisions. In the context of time and the boardroom, the consideration of CSR can be affected by board structure. For example, because of considerable short-term pressures, this study posits that insiders on the board are less likely to prioritize the longer-term time horizons needed to affect CSR. Following this perspective, a hypothesis is put forth that insiders generally have temporal orientations that are more short term in nature and that they therefore have a negative effect on CSR. A study of 300 of Australia's largest firms confirmed this hypothesis. However, when inside director compensation linked to environmental and social metrics and inside director CSR training are introduced as moderating variables, their interactive effects lead to positive results: both positively moderate the negative insider-CSR relationship in environmental and social dimensions. The study contributes to a temporal view of boards of directors, as well as to corporate governance and CSR. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

We examine the relation between boards of directors' knowledge heterogeneity and organizational ambidexterity (OA) (i.e. simultaneous exploration and exploitation) in knowledge-intensive firms (KIFs). Although the literature on OA has started to emphasize its antecedents, the role of the board remains unaddressed. This is an important omission, as boards have become increasingly involved in strategy-making. In turn, studies on boards have looked at their influence on either exploration- or exploitation-type strategies. Yet, KIFs particularly need to balance both exploration and exploitation to renew their knowledge base. We draw on knowledge-based perspectives to disentangle the benefits and costs of board knowledge heterogeneity for driving OA in KIFs. Our empirical analysis based on a longitudinal panel of UK pharmaceutical firms provides support for our hypothesized U-shaped relation. Our findings suggest that the benefits of knowledge heterogeneity only outweigh the costs beyond a particular threshold. Overall, our theoretical approach and allied findings advance the literature by introducing boundary conditions to the resource provision role of boards in KIFs. We discuss contributions for organizational learning, strategic leadership, and human resource management. We conclude with implications for theory and practice, as well as key opportunities for future research. (c) 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

In this empirical study, we investigate the variation in firms' response to institutional pressure for gender-balanced boards, focusing specifically on the preservation of prevailing practices of director selection and its impact on the representation of women on the board of directors. Using 8 years of data from publicly listed Nordic corporations, we show societal pressure to be one of the determinants of female directorship. Moreover, in some corporations, the director selection process may work to maintain "a traditional type of board". In such boards, demographic diversity among male members appears to be associated with a lower share of female directors, although we cannot establish wether this reflects discrimination or a desire to maintain critical competencies. With this paper we add to the theoretical understanding of the factors underlying female board appointments by adopting an institutional theory lens to study female board representation. Viewing the demands for gender-balanced boards in terms of societal pressure for the de-institutionalization of the prevailing norms and practices, we highlight preferences for maintaining established practices as a potentially important barrier to institutional change. On these grounds, we conjecture on the relationship between the gender diversity of boards and other diversity dimensions. We suggest that a board room gender quota (if implemented) is supplemented by policies to ensure the transparency of board changes, in order to prevent the crowding out of other diversity dimensions.

Boards of directors represent a central factor for firm success by performing different tasks such as control, networking, or advice. Stemming from socioemotional wealth (SEW) literature, the aim of this article is to investigate the board tasks-financial performance relationship, showing their different contributions in family and non-family firms when firm survival is at stake. The main hypotheses are tested through moderated linear regression analyses. The findings suggest that while advisory tasks generally enhance financial performance in family firms, especially during turmoil, networking and control tasks have a detrimental effect when these firms suffer internal financial crises. Hence, we contribute to the SEW paradigm by underlining that family firms seem to accept performance hazards in order to protect family discretion and a positive public reputation even when they suffer severe hardship. In contrast, board advice supports utilizing family firms' unique social capital and significantly bolsters financial performance, without disturbing the family and its SEW preservation needs.

While studies show that organizational diversity is beneficial to their practice of environmental sustainability, we know very little about the effect that the gender of an individual director can have on sustainability practice. In this empirical paper, we employ a micro-foundational approach to examine whether the number of women on an organization's board of directors has a direct effect on its attitude towards environmental sustainability, regardless of the national culture in which the organization is located. Culture in this study is measured through grammatical gender marking, a unique approach to measuring women-oriented cultural effects. Previous studies show that certain cultures have more gender roles than others do, which in turn affect general and organizational behavior in that society. Grammatical gender marking enables us to study the impact of gender of the individual director on the organization's attitude towards environmental sustainability across cultures, by empirically examining data from 71 countries, sampling 4500 organizations for multiple years and industries. Our findings show that organizations become significantly more proactive in environmental sustainability with the appointment of even one woman to the board of directors, regardless of the local culture. We further show that the organization's level of disclosure regarding its sustainability activities increases with the number of women on the board of directors. Our data also show a significantly negative relationship between various gender-based language indices and the presence of women on the board of directors. In cultures defined by a language that has clear grammatical gender markings, there is a tendency to appoint fewer women to boards of directors, thereby influencing indirectly the organization's attitude towards environmental sustainability.

This paper examines the role of the board of directors in influencing the value of Italian listed firms from 2003 to 2013. In particular, employing agency, stewardship and resource dependence theories, the study aims to compare board characteristics in family and non-family firms and define the theory that best applies to family firms. Empirical results show that the presence of CEO duality and busy directors has a positive effect on the value of family firms, while gender diversity has a negative impact on the value when a member of the family leads a family firm. Conversely, the size of the board positively affects the value of non-family firms. Our main findings suggest the prevalence, in family firms, of the benefits of the board structure argued by stewardship and resource dependence theories rather than the disadvantages expected from agency theory.

Governance scholars debate the value of directors as an effective governance mechanism. We suggest that this value varies with director tenure. We study both how shareholder assessments of the value of individual directors vary with director tenure and whether director tenure actually makes a practical difference to governance effectiveness. Using data from abnormal stock price reactions to the sudden deaths of 274 outside directors, and integrating executive cognition and social capital perspectives applied to the dual roles of director monitoring and advising, our results confirm a curvilinear relationship between the assessed value of directors and tenure. We find that directors are more highly valued by investors over a tenure period between 7 and 18 years, moderated by director involvement on key committees. Further, in examining the S & P 1,500, we find that a one standard deviation increase in the percentage of outside directors in this prime tenure period strengthens the CEO pay-performance linkage by 2.5%, suggesting that directors in this tenure period are more effective in aligning CEO and shareholder interests. Our results demonstrate that individual director tenure makes a difference in governance effectiveness, and shareholders accurately assess this difference. Additionally, our findings provide important boundary conditions for when theories of executive cognition and social capital may be more/less applicable regarding director tenure. (c) 2017 INFORMS.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between women in the board of directors, firm performance and corporate decisions as well as the risk of the firm, debt level, and research and development (R&D). Design/methodology/approach: This study investigates a sample of 41 Italian listed companies. In particular, using a panel data of 369 firm-year observations, during the period 2005-2013, through a generalized method of moment, the relationship between women in the board of directors and corporate decisions has been investigated. Findings: The results suggest that female representation in the board of directors affects corporate decisions. Women in the boardroom affect both financing and investment decisions. In particular, the presence of women seems to take on a complementary role to debt; it has a negative effect on risk and appears to have a positive impact on investment in R&D The results also suggest a strong relationship between female directors and firm value, especially when certain multicultural factors are considered. Finally, considering the concept of "critical mass," in line with the arguments of Kanter (1977), the results seem to emphasize a greater influence of women with respect to corporate decisions, moving from "tokenism" to a "critical mass" scenario. Practical implications: The outcomes of the application, besides improving the current knowledge on the relationship between female representation in the board of directors, innovation, financial, and accounting decisions, intend to reveal if the governance of Italian listed companies is efficient in determining company results and in pursuing optimal decisions. Moreover, the results could be useful for both policy makers for the regulation of corporate governance and the board of directors and as a suggestion to companies that regularly appoint the members of the board of directors. Originality/value: The work is not limited to examining the relationship between female representation and the performance of firms but instead uses a series of indicators of corporate decisions and multicultural, such as, the nationality of women in board of directors, the educational level, the past experience, and their interaction with the variables concerning the decision-making process. To the best knowledge of authors, this is the first study that investigates the relationship between women and corporate decisions in a single civil law country.

Taking a combination between agency theory and resource dependence theory, we point out that directors' capital may have an effect on R&D strategies. A sample of both high-tech and low-tech industries for the period 2007-2011 is used. The results indicate that, regardless of the type of industry and the specific expertise on R&D intensive companies, board members with multiple directorships influence R&D corporate strategies. The resources acquired by directors through their experience and connections positively influence R&D intensity, but only if directors can carry out their monitoring activity adequately. This evidence implies a step forward in the understanding of the role of board of directors in corporate strategy, thus having significant implications for academics, companies and regulators, which are both theoretical and practical.

More and more boards are tapping interim CEOs to temporarily fill the corner office. Prior research indicates the negative performance implications of this decision; yet, little is known about the rationale behind this decision. Our aim is to fill this research gap. Drawing on agency and human capabilities frameworks, we examined the contextual elements that influence a board's decision to pursue temporary leadership. Within a sample of 375 successions occurring between 1998 and 2005, we found that boards of directors were more likely to select interim CEOs under certain succession conditions, namely, when the prior CEO was forced out and there was no heir apparent or when the prior CEO had served for a short tenure. Our results highlight the importance of context in succession selections and provide insights into why a board would pursue a decision with seemingly negative repercussions. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2014, (c) The Author(s) 2014.

In this paper we address how director expertise impacts a director's social status and conformity within the board. Our results, derived from two unique multi-source datasets of peer ratings on director status and conformity of non-executive directors from Dutch organizations, indicate that industry-specific expertise and financial expertise differently impact directors' social status and influence within the board. We find that directors' individual performance orientation - the motivation to demonstrate expertise - acts as an important contingency for expertise to increase directors' status within the board. Additional analyses using archival data and interviews with non-executive directors substantiate our findings and provide additional insight into the dynamics operating within boards. This study extends existing research on boards of directors and provides unique micro-level insights into the boardroom dynamics that connect director expertise to director status and conformity within boards.

Research summary: Venture boards are theoretically important and economically relevant. They are at the apex of a venture's organizational hierarchy and have significant influence on the most important decisions related to venture strategy and personnel. This article reviews the organizational and strategy research on venture boards, clarifying how venture boards differ from venture investors and from public firm boards. It lays out a systematic research agenda to stimulate more research on venture governance, including venture board composition and structure, venture board processes, and venture board transitions to public firm boards. This agenda attempts to illuminate the research opportunities related to the distinctive nature of venture boards and enable theoretical engagement with the broader corporate governance scholarship on public firms. Managerial summary: A venture's board of directors is highly consequential for its most important strategic and personnel outcomes. Uber and Theranos are just two recent ventures whose boards have come under public spotlight. This article reviews organizational and strategy research on venture boards, mapping the evolution of the academic literature, summarizing key findings, and identifying the most important limitations. It explains how venture boards are different from venture investors and from public firm boards. Importantly, it lays out a systematic research agenda that draws upon the distinctive nature of venture boards and also creates a bridge to the broader literature on public firm boards. New insights on venture board composition, structure, process, and transition to public firm boards will be relevant to venture executives, investors, and directors.

Previous studies have established that firms' effectiveness can differ based on the differences among directors within a board, and between boards. However, studies have yet to establish the effectiveness of the diverse attributes of the board on firms' quality of earnings in an emerging market setting such as Vietnam. This study investigates the effect of board diversity on earnings quality in a sample of Vietnamese listed firms. The two dimensions of board diversity measures in this study cover a wide range of structural and demographic attributes of board of directors, using a diversity-of-boards index (dissimilarities among firm boards, i.e., board structure) and a diversity-in-boards index (dissimilarities among directors within a board, i.e., demographic attributes of board members). Earnings quality is an aggregate measure compiled from four accounting-based measures of earnings quality: accruals quality, earnings persistence, earnings predictability and earnings smoothness. We find a significant, positive linear relationship between diversity of boards and earnings quality, while the relationship between diversity in boards and earnings quality is non-linear, with a U-shaped curve.

The board of directors is legally responsible for setting the strategic direction of the firm and for ensuring the firm's long-term performance in almost all governance environments. However, many boards delegate part or all of the task of creating and executing the firm's strategy to a group of full-time professional managers. This separation between ownership and control creates many challenges for the modern-day firm, and the board's role in the strategy formation process is arguably the seminal governance challenge confronting boards today. This study examines this seminal challenge by: (1) Introducing background information on this stream by defining key terms and discussing its importance to the wider corporate governance literature, describing three infamous case studies of firms based in the USA, Europe and Asia where the board was insufficiently involved, and noting situations where the board may become too involved; (2) Exploring previous reviews of this research stream on board strategic involvement, and discussing the evolution of this construct and related studies over time; (3) Analyzing previous research designs used in this research stream while identifying the frequency as well as costs and benefits associated with each; (4) Summarizing what we currently know about the multi-level antecedents of board involvement within single countries; (5) Specifying some of the national-level antecedents of board involvement identified in cross-national studies; (6) Identifying the subsequent multi-level effects of board involvement; and (7) Discussing the implications of this review and outlining future research directions.

The language that signals conformity to a prevailing norm can contribute to the appearance of managerial competency and organizational legitimacy. We argue that top corporate managers' use of language that is congruent with a prevailing norm leads the boards of directors to evaluate the managers more favourably and to grant a higher level of compensation. We test this argument by analysing the letters to shareholders from 334 US firms and examine the CEOs' expression of the shareholder value principle, which is a prevailing model of corporate governance in the USA. We found that the use of shareholder-value language is significantly related to a higher level of CEO compensation and that the effect of shareholder-value language is greater when shareholder activism is stronger.

The study examines the effect of female directors on firm performance for Indian firms, where the domination of family firms and a patriarchal society may reduce the importance of female directors. Our empirical results suggest that the gender diversity does not matter for Indian firms. Our further results support this finding by indicating that female directors face more attendance problems compared to male directors, and are less likely to be appointed in monitoring-related committees. Overall, our results strengthen the tokenism status theory associated with female directors, especially in family-owned firms and in a patriarchal society. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the impact of board characteristics on the amount of capital raised through an IPO for a sample of 220 Malaysian IPOs over the period of 2005-2015, applying both ordinary least squares (OLS) and quantile regression (QR) techniques. The OLS results show that board with ethnic Malay directors has a significant and positive association with the amount of capital raised, while a weak significance is found for board size. However, the QR results reveal that other than board ethnicity, other board characteristics namely board size, board independence and CEO duality are significantly associated with the amount of capital raised. The additional results suggest that QR provides a more insightful and full picture into the association than does OLS. The overall empirical evidence lends support to the resource dependence role of the board of directors at the time of an IPO. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: Corporate accountability is a complex chain of reporting that reaches from external stakeholders into the organization's management structure. The transition from external to internal accountability mechanisms primarily occurs at the board of directors. Yet outside of incentive mechanisms, we know surprisingly little about how internal actors (management) are held to account by the representatives of external shareholders (the board). The purpose of this paper is to explore the process of accountability at this transition point by documenting the routines used by boards to hold the firm's management to account. In doing so, we develop the understanding of the important transition between internal and external firm accountability. Design/methodology/approach: An inductive, case-based approach identifies recurrent behaviour patterns in two matched boards over three video-taped meetings. Sequential analysis of coded group and individual behaviours provides insight into boards' accountability routines. Findings: The boards engaged in clear, recurrent accountability routines. Individuals on the boards play different roles in these routines depending on the issue before the board, allowing both directors and managers to hold each other to account. The outsiders (directors) both challenge and support the insiders (managers) during board discussions, switching their behaviours with different agenda items but maintaining a consistent group level of support and scepticism across the meeting. This allows for the simultaneous development of trust and verification at the group level, a necessary condition for effective accountability. Research limitations/implications: As board relationships and organisational context are highly variable, future research should concentrate on testing the generalizability of the results across different board and shareholder structures. Practical implications: The results call into question the current governance focus on the independence of the individual director, as the authors identify that all directors appear to act as agents at one time or another in a meeting. Accountability at the boardroom level requires an effective group process not usually addressed in governance recommendations or regulation. Originality/value: This study provides unique insights into board dynamics, documenting the accountability implications of group behaviours. By focussing on the group process, the authors highlight the potential mismatch of monotonic, individual-level approaches to governance and accountability prevalent in current agency approaches.

Purpose: Presently, one of the major governance issues faced by management and shareholders of organizations is the gender composition of the boards of directors and audit committees. This study aims to examine the impact of gender diversity in audit committees on the accuracy of management earnings forecasts disclosure in initial public offering (IPO) prospectuses. Design/methodology/approach: The study sample comprises 190 Malaysian companies issuing IPOs that transformed into public companies during the period 2002-2012. Earnings forecasts accuracy (quality) is proxied by absolute forecast error and the study model is developed based on the frameworks of the signalling theory, the agency theory and the resource-dependence theory. Findings: The study proposes that female directors introduce a set of specific features in the boardroom that serve to improve investor protection and efficient monitoring of management. However, findings reveal an insignificantly positive relationship between gender diversity in audit committees and absolute forecast error, which shows that more female directors in audit committees could translate into more errors and less accuracy in earnings forecasts. Practical implications: Considering the recent regulatory developments that encourage the number of women on the board of directors, the findings obtained have significant implications for policymakers. The study findings can also be invaluable to investors, investment analysts, market players and researchers. Originality/value: The composition of the board of directors and audit committees in terms of gender plays a significant role in the promotion of effective corporate governance practices. This study is one of the pioneering studies that examines the advantages of gender diversity in the board of directors. It is also the first study to extend IPO literature by investigating the role of gender diversity in audit committees in the enhancement of accurate management earnings forecasts included in the IPO prospectuses.

Leadership, governance and performance in family businesses are broadly studied, but results are contradictory. There is a need for deeper understanding of these relationships since emotional and behavioral aspects are complex in these types businesses. Questions on the how and the why of board functioning and ownership, and their influences on performance are scarce, given lack of data or a focus on quantitative data. To find a balance between qualitative and quantitative methods, we explore fuzzy sets logic as a methodology to expand knowledge in family businesses and present an application to build a representation of entrepreneurial performance results based on board of directors' composition and CEO's ownership, using case studies. Results indicate that the methodology offers alternative explanations to governance, leadership and performance dimensions in these businesses. Using fuzzy sets logic, we find that entrepreneurial performance is higher when outsiders' membership in boards of directors and CEO ownership are both high as well.

Purpose: Using a contingency approach, the purpose of this paper is to study how organizational factors (such as the organizational life cycle, firm size, firm ownership concentration and firm technology) determine the relative importance of the monitoring and provision of resources roles provided by board members. Design/methodology/approach: This paper highlights the importance of contingency factors in carrying out board's roles using a sample of 579 European firms registered in the STOXX Europe 600 index. The authors used a longitudinal analysis for the period from 2002 through to 2011. Findings: The results show that the monitoring role is more relevant for companies that are large, are operating at the mature and stagnant stages, have a dispersed ownership and are low-technology. However, the provision of resources role is more relevant for companies that are in the growth and stagnant stages, and have a concentrated ownership. Originality/value: The traditional analysis that relates the board's structure and composition to the board's roles focuses on determining what board should be the best. It plays little attention to analyzing which organizational factors affect the importance and presence of monitoring or resource dependence roles. In this regard, this work adds significant insights to agency theory and resource dependence theory as, with a contingency framework, the research aims to find what functions the board needs to develop in order to get better firm performance.

The aim of this article is to shed new light on the antecedent of board composition in family firms. By integrating socioemotional wealth and stewardship theory, we hypothesise that family-oriented objectives not only affect the traditional dichotomous classification (family vs. non-family board members) but also the inner composition among family board members (e.g., family board members working in the firm vs. family board members not working in the firm). Our main findings suggest that the stronger the importance of family-oriented objectives, the greater the presence of family members on boards of directors. Furthermore, for high levels of family-oriented objectives, where steward-oriented behaviours prevail, the sub-group of family board members on the board will be mainly composed of family board members working in the firm.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether companies with female executives and directors are less likely to be involved in financial reporting fraud litigation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors build a data set comprised of companies from the Stanford Securities Class Action Clearinghouse database that were involved in fraud litigation along with a control set of companies listed on the Compustat database for the time period 2007-2013. The authors use a logistic regression model to determine the likelihood of fraud when there is at least one woman in an executive position or on the board of directors. Findings: The authors find that the presence of at least one female leader decreases the likelihood that the company will be involved in litigation for financial reporting fraud. The results are robust after controlling for sample selection bias by using a propensity score matched sample. Practical implications: The findings add to the literature which indicates that women tend to be more risk averse and are more committed to ethics policies. The study also supports previous research that indicates large firms with inflated market value are more likely to be subject to fraud litigation. Originality/value: The study combines the literature on the characteristics of women in leadership positions with the study of fraud litigation. The authors find evidence that the presence of either female executives or female directors lowers financial reporting fraud risk. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

When making investment decisions, many investors now regularly consider a company's CSR activities along with traditional financial performance measures (Elliott et al., 2014). Our study considers whether shareholders may also consider CSR activities when voting in director elections and say-on-pay votes. We find that CSR performance is associated with shareholder support in both director elections and say-on-pay votes. In particular, we find higher support for both director elections and executive compensation when there are more CSR strengths. Additionally, we find that the social strength aspect of CSR is the most important component in the relationships between CSR and director elections and that the environmental strengths aspect is the most important component in the relationship between CSR and executive compensation. Our results suggest that shareholders may value certain types of CSR and are more supportive of boards and management when CSR performance is stronger. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd

The impact of female directors on firm performance has lacked consistency in the previously conducted empirical studies, which may be due to the endogeneity problem, or certain characteristics (i.e. governance, industry, competition). This study examines the relationship between female directors and firm performance by addressing those problems. This study analyses all non-financial UK listed firms during the period 2004-2012 and employs several econometric models. The regression results indicate that there is little evidence that female directors have a positive and strong relationship with firm performance. But, further analysis reports that the UK's small listed firms experience a positive significant effect, because small firms do not suffer from the problem of over-monitoring and they have more flexibility in composing their boards of directors.

This study applies a new multi-focal actor-centered institution-theoretic approach to examine the association between executive pay and the recruitment of social elites to the board of directors in developing countries. We use a sample of 119 initial public offerings (IPOs) from 17 African stock markets to model this relationship. The results suggest that a higher proportion of elites on the board is associated with lower executive pay. This is moderated by institutional quality; that is, lower institutional quality is associated with more directors drawn from social elites and with higher pay, while the opposite is true in higher-institutional-quality environments. Our findings confirm the importance of the social environment within which governance is embedded. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of the study is to examine the effect of diversity in the board of directors on the performance of the listed Italian financial institutions. The sample is a data set of 177 firm-year observations covering 2011 to 2014. The performance of the firm is measured by Tobin's Q while board diversity is analysed considering the percentage of female and foreign directors on the board (or their conjoint presence as a proxy of overall demographic diversity) and task-diversity is measured by board interlocking directorship and busy directors. Findings suggest that female directors have no effect on firm performance. Foreign directors and interlocking directorship have, instead, a positive statistically significant relationship with performance while we find a negative statistically significant relationship between busy directors and performance. When we consider the overall demographic diversity on the board we observe that it is positively and significantly related to the performance of the financial firm.

This study examines how behavioral processes among nominating committees, CEOs, and board chairs affect the comprehensiveness of non-executive director selection planning and evaluation. Building on a theory-building multiple-case study, our findings indicate that comprehensiveness is based on three key factors: (1) task-related mutual and collective interactions in nominating committees, (2) board chair leadership in structuring selection processes with high facilitation skills, and (3) the level and timing of information exchange between CEOs and board chairs. Furthermore, we highlight the interconnectedness and temporal embeddedness of these behavioral processes. Our study contributes to a more holistic understanding of non-executive director selections and provides new insights into the complex and interwoven social dynamics among nominating committees, CEOs, and board chairs.

While directors' task boundaries are usually ambiguous, some of their activities or behaviors clearly constitute their formal duties, whereas others are usually perceived as organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Applying identity theory, we present a theoretical model that demonstrates one of the key drivers for directors to engage in OCB with a focus on their role identity. We argue that an individual director's role identity is one of the key factors that motivate directors to engage in OCB. Furthermore, we propose that two board-level contingencies, board capital, and informal board hierarchy order, can moderate the effect of directors' role-identity salience on their OCB. That is, low levels of board capital and directors' higher positions in a board's informal hierarchy enhance directors' motivation to engage in OCB.

The increasing emphasis on social responsibility across the world is not new (Warhurst, 2005) and many countries require companies to disclose information about their environmental, social and employee-related impact, as well as their diversity policy (The Hauser Institute, 2015). India took CSR to the next level by mandating it for all companies through the recently introduced Section 135 in the Companies Act (2013). The provisions of the section require companies to establish a CSR committee consisting of three members of the Board of Directors to develop a CSR policy and review the CSR activities and prepare periodic reports. The above mentioned CSR infrastructure therefore necessitates significant capacity building within companies. With respect to implementation, companies may channel their resources through qualified nongovernmental organisations (NGOs). Consequently NGOs will also require significant capacity building. In this paper we identify the implications of the new guidelines that are worthy of consideration; these implications are for companies that meet the criteria to and therefore must comply with the provisions contained in Section 135, the organisations (including NGOs) that will implement the activities and other general implications. Furthermore the paper suggests mechanisms by which several of these challenges can be met and managed. Copyright (c) 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

In this study, a cross-theoretical hybridization between diversity archetypes and the behavioural theory of corporate governance is proposed. Within an integrative theoretical framework, I discuss three variants of the board's social setting: diversity as variety; separation; and disparity. Their influence on the mechanisms of the socially-situated and socially-constituted agency, and in consequence the socially-constructed boardroom reality, is considered. The model stipulates what kind of impact individual agency perception, associated with each diversity archetype, can be expected to have on board task effectiveness (monitoring/control, resource-provision, and strategy-making/consulting). There are altogether six theoretical propositions made in this paper. The study represents an application of the behavioural theory of corporate governance in the theory-building paper. I utilise the notion of diversity and the theory of subgroups from existing group effectiveness literature. The proposed theoretical framework strongly benefits from recent taxonomically-systematizing efforts in the area of diversity research. The proposed model also allows for due consideration of behavioural patterns in the boardroom. This framework scores high on its generalisability to a wider population and realism of context, but low on its precision of measurement. A discussion of the model's limitations unfolds in the wider context of the challenges and paradoxes/conundrums with which the community of corporate governance scholars is invariably confronted. The model suffers from a limited translatability of findings into actionable managerial implications and recommendations of the regulator, as expressed in corporate governance codes.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the link between board of director composition and firm performance. Specifically, the paper argues that board political experience influences the firm's internationalization strategy as directors with significant political experience provide guidance, resources, and network access that enhance the firm's international presence. The authors also posit that board political connections would be more helpful for firms operating in high-regulation industries. Design/methodology/approach: The authors tested the predictions using data from 156 large US firms. Data on directors' background were gathered from SEC proxy filings, while data pertaining to internationalization were obtained from Compustat and Mergent Online databases. Hierarchical moderated regression analysis was employed to empirically test the hypothesized relationships. Findings: The findings provide strong support for the positive relationship between board political experience and the degree of firm internationalization. Contrary to the authors' predictions, the level of industry regulation does not seem to significantly affect this relationship. Research limitations/implications: Firms aggressively pursuing international strategy could benefit from having directors on their board with robust political experience. One of the limitations of the study is that the types of international activities for firms is not specified in the study as it might be in the form of joint-venture capacity, strategic alliances or for firms that might be born-global. Originality/value: This study makes original contribution to the on-going research on board political activity and firm performance through internationalization strategy. The findings suggest that having directors' with political experience is an important asset in influencing firm's corporate strategy. (c) 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Objectives Even though management talent is not, or should not be, a gender-related question, the smaller representation that women have in the executive governing bodies of companies is a well-known fact. Achieving adequate gender diversity on corporate boards does not only constitute a challenge on a level of ethics, policy and corporate social responsibility, it can also be an objective of efficiency, the veracity of which should be examined. Starting from this point of view, the aim of this work is to analyze if an increase in the feminine presence in the Boards of Management of companies leads to an improvement of its economic profitability (measured by the Rentability over Assets -RoA-). Specifically, for this research, we have opted for a sectoral analysis of credit cooperatives, which have been expressly elected for being non-listed financial entities, as well as being very homogeneous in their business model, both for its territorial nature and for the retail banking model implemented. Aditionally these entities incorporate the cooperative principles as a differentiating element of its corporate culture. The intention is nor to analyze the possible barriers that currently exist for the promotion of women to managerial positions, since they have already been included in several studies that analyze this issue, including the case of Spain (Ribas and Sajardo, 2005; Mateos et. al., 2010; Esteban, 2013). On the contrary, we want to know to which extent gender diversity affects the performance of credit unions both as companies and as financial institutions. Methodological approach The methodology that has been applied is based on the Generalized Method of Moments (MGM), used for the estimation of a dynamic linear equation with a panel composed of 78 entities during the period 2000-2014. This has been using the best source of public data of the sector, the Spanish Association of Credit Unions (UNACC). The dependent variable in the model is the economic profitability or rentability over assets (RoA), being the independent variables two measures of gender (proportion of female counselors and gender diversity on boards) and several main indicators of the economic and financial structure of the entities (efficiency, financial profitability, leverage, financial gap and solvency). Firstly, to run the analysis, the independent variables have been included on an individual basis, and then the impact of those related to gender through their interaction with the remaining independent variables, differentiating in both cases the effect according to the economic cycle. Results/Implications/Limitations The results obtained show the low female presence in the councils of the credit unions, since, on average, the proportion of female counselors reaches only 7.7% of the total membership, all of which explains the low value of the average Arithmetic of the Blau index (0,12), since these are not diversified Councils. Therefore, these results confirm that Spanish credit cooperatives have a gender gap even greater than the listed companies, both from Spain (13% in 2014) and from Europe (21% in 2015), according to the Spencer Stuart Board of Directors' Index (2015) and the European Commission (2016), respectively, which may be explained by the lack of regulation on mandatory gender quotas in their Boards. The results also indicate that the existence of a greater proportion of women on the boards of these entities contributed positively to improving their rentability over assets (RoA) through increased rentability over equity (RoE) and financial leverage. However, during the period of economic crisis (from 2008 to 2014) for each percentage point that the proportion of women in the council increased, the rentability over assets (RoA) was reduced by 2.39%, the rest of the variables remaining constant. The analysis of the research hypotheses allows us to observe, firstly, that the gender diversity in the Boards of Directors of the credit cooperatives analyzed is an important element to be taken into account in explaining the evolution of their rentability over assets (RoA), as well as through other economic- financial magnitudes, such as financial profitability, leverage or efficiency (H1 hypothesis). Secondly, the results obtained show that the effect of gender on the rentability over assets (RoA) has been subordinated to the existing economic cycle, since a negative impact is shown directly from 2008 onwards. Indirectly, through financial profitability and efficiency, the role of women has gone from being positive to zero or negative after the beginning of the crisis, depending on the proportion of women or gender diversity, respectively, as well as through the financial gap, therefore the negative effect (H2 hypothesis) becomes more intense. Conclusions/Findings As a main conclusion, it is possible to emphasize that the economic crisis has conditioned both the direct impact of the analyzed variables and the indirect one of gender in profitability. Thus, when we analyze the direct effect of women on the rentability over assets (RoA), we can see that the relationship between women and men is null or negative depending on the economic cycle, while the impact is both positive and negative, depending on the indirect approach used. This study has tried to fill a gap in the literature that analyzes the effect of gender on business profitability, such as the analysis in a sector of unlisted companies and for a broad period of time, which allows to contemplate different scenarios according to the economic cycle. In order to do this, a dynamic linear equation has been estimated by working with a panel of 78 Spanish cooperative credit institutions during the period 2000-2014 using the MGM. By doing this, it has been possible to measure both the direct impact of the proportion of women counselors and gender heterogeneity in the rentability over assets (RoA), as well as the consequences of the interaction with other variables, differentiating in both cases, whether this effect has been conditioned to the financial crisis in Spain (2008-2014). A further improvement of this research could be a qualitative aspect of a more difficult measurement that can be approached with a different methodology, analyzing the capacity of influence on the decisions that each woman can have on the rest of the members of the board in relation with deliberations and decision-making. This problem statement would mean focusing in the analysis of female leadership that can help understand the results obtained in this work, since the numerical increase in the number of women in boards cannot provide differentiation if they do not exercise the appropriate leadership in boards, that are generally composed of an average of 10 to 12 members. This study has been conditioned by a series of limitations, among which, fundamentally, are the non-possession and inclusion of data and valuations on certain characteristics that can be conditioned to the effect of gender on business performance, such as the characteristics of governance and the type of tasks performed by women on the boards. From another point of view, due to the fact that credit unions have a social purpose, it should be of interest to analyze other aspects of governance that allow studying not only the impact of women on the economic profitability of this entities, but also the possible effect that they may have in their social profitability, all of which stands as future lines of research.

A board of directors consists of a set of key personnel that hold vital positions in a company. Based on the premise of the resource dependence theory, we explore the association between board diversity and innovation performance in Malaysia. The sample consists of 220 companies from the industrial product sector of the main market of Bursa Malaysia for the financial year 2013. Board diversity is represented by a comprehensive score that includes age, gender, ethnicity, nationality, education, tenure, area of experience and directorship in other companies. Results of the regression analysis show that there is a positive association between board diversity and innovation performance. Our findings contribute to the policy involving the diversity of corporate boards by suggesting that policy, such as one of gender diversity in Malaysia, is expanded to include multi-dimensional aspects of board diversity that better represent the economic, legal and cultural environment of a country.

Purpose: The authors contend that immediately following the initial public offering (IPO), the new owners that replace the original ones are likely to request changes in two corporate governance mechanisms, board of directors and top management teams (TMTs). Following these alterations, the purpose of this paper is to propose that such changes will be detrimental for the performance of young entrepreneurial firms. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the post-IPO governance changes in young entrepreneurial firms. The sample consists of 185 companies that went public between 2001 and 2005. A hierarchical linear regression approach with the appropriate control variables is adopted to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The results revealed that, following the changes in ownership structure post-IPO, changes are observed in one of the corporate governance mechanisms the authors considered, boards of directors, but not TMTs. Consistent with the general theme of this study, the authors also observed a negative impact of changes in boards of directors on subsequent firm performance; this was not the case with TMTs. Research limitations/implications: Contrary to the fundamental contentions of agency theory, the results highlight the need for adopting a different approach for young entrepreneurial firms. Practical implications: The findings highlight the importance of preserving the entrepreneurial efficacy of young entrepreneurial firms. Originality/value: This paper challenges the fundamental contentions of agency theory in the case of young entrepreneurial firms. The results demonstrate that post-IPO shareholders' interference with the governance mechanisms results in lower performance. (c) 2017, (c) Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to identify distinct motivation profiles among non-executive directors and explores the reasons why non-executive directors continue to serve on boards of directors. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is based on a multiple case study in the context of German supervisory boards. The authors develop their primary insights from semi-structured interviews with 53 non-executive directors. Findings: The findings indicate that non-executive director motivation revolves around material incentives, reputation, meaningfulness, congruence with firm goals and enjoyment. Three distinct motivation profiles emerge from the analysis, with each profile exhibiting a set of unique reasons to continue serving on boards. Research limitations/implications: Future research needs to test for the statistical representativeness of the findings and their performance implications, preferably in a shareholder-oriented governance context. Originality/value: The study introduces a psychological angle to the debate about non-executive director motivation. The contributions include going beyond a bi-polar distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and draw attention to how motivation profiles relate to non-executive director's intention to continue serving on boards.

The research question of this research work is whether women and men of German supervisory boards differ in their human capital and therefore gender diversity contributes to diversity in knowledge and skills. The curricula vitae of 264 female and male members of the boards were compared. We find empirical evidence that women and men differ in the following dimensions: number of degrees, kind and level of education, length and kind of professional experience, number of board seats, external versus internal appointment, internationality and number of children. No differences could be found regarding family affiliation. Therefore, we conclude that women in the board broaden the resource portfolio of knowledge and skill in supervisory boards. This result represents an important contribution to the corporate governance research. Further, the study contributes to the human capital theory by analyzing criteria that have been neglected so far. The study provides the basis for solid discussions about women in top management positions. (c) 2017, Schmalenbach-Gesellschaft fur Betriebswirtschaft e.V.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse the impact of company performance, governance structure and ownership structure in determining the managerial remuneration for 134 listed companies in India over the years 2003-2012. Design/methodology/approach - Remuneration paid to the board of directors of companies is taken to represent the managerial remuneration. Exogeneity among the company performance measures is verified with the endogtest suggested in Baum et al. (2007). A fixed effects panel regression with clustered standard errors is employed after checking for the presence of heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation and cross-sectional dependence in the data. Findings - The study reveals that managerial remuneration increases as the accounting performance of companies improves, whereas the market performance of companies has no significant association with managerial remuneration. The study also shows that foreign institutional shareholding is significantly and positively related with managerial remuneration in India. Research limitations/implications - This study highlights the various factors which affect the determination of managerial remuneration in India. These findings can be used as inputs by regulatory authorities in framing and improving governance norms regarding managerial remuneration. This study also suggests that factors other than the number, the independence and objectivity of independent directors are more important in determining managerial remuneration. Originality/value - The present study proposes more reliable results, obtained through a fixed effects panel regression model with clustered standard error estimates and also checks endogeneity of performance measures with the endogtest, which is the appropriate test to use for verifying endogeneity in panel data.

Purpose: This paper aims to show the importance of introducing an integration manager (i.e. an executive position used to channel the acquiring firm's course of action and strengthen the success of a post-acquisition integration process) within the acquiring firm's board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: This is a theoretical paper that introduces the integration manager within the board of privately held firms going internationally via acquisitions and serving as an "out-insider" director able to balance the conflicting demands of the previously separated entities during their integration process. The authors present an explanatory case study that empirically contributes to the board of directors' design for internationalization. Findings: The authors posit that the integration manager serves as an "out-insider" director of the board for privately held firms, possessed by large-block shareholders, going internationally via acquisitions, providing the necessary expertise and knowledge of the target firm's products and industry. Originality/value: The provided study aims to show that international acquisitions, even though apparently less risky than greenfield investments, may require additional neutral information flow - both within the due-diligence process and the post-acquisition integration - that only outsiders possess. Such an outsider has been individuated in the integration manager whose crucial role focuses on smoothing the pre- and post-acquisition integration processes.

This study examined the influence of gender diversity among company boards of directors and managerial ownership on corporate risk-taking. The sample was manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange from 2010 to 2013 selected using the purposive sampling method. Data was examined using multiple regression methods. The results showed that gender diversity on a board of directors (BOD) and managerial ownership have no significant effect on corporate risk-taking. This is likely due to the relatively low percentage of both variables in Indonesia, thus, they do not tend to affect corporate risk-taking decisions. The study recommends increasing gender diversity and managerial ownership in the corporate risk-taking process towards sustainable business practices. (c) Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

In this paper we develop a model for researching the influence that a board of directors can have on improving an organization's sustainability performance. Our model explores sources of cognitive flexibility of boards needed to recognize and respond to the need for improved sustainability performance. We first define concepts of sustainability, sustainability competence, and sustainability performance. We then analyze two forms of board capital (a board's human capital and its social capital) and three aspects of a board's information processing (its patterns of information search, discussion and debate, and information absorption) that we suggest affect a board's cognitive flexibility and thereby influence whether a board decides to adopt sustainability performance goals. Our model also suggests that an organization's strategic flexibility - as represented by its current endowments of resource flexibilities and coordination flexibilities - will moderate the relationship between a board's decision to adopt sustainability performance goals and an organization's subsequent achievement of those goals. We also suggest that our model is generally relevant to any research seeking to predict the influence of boards on strategic change in many forms, not just to research focused on sustainability issues.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between board dependence, antitakeover provisions and their influence on corporate entrepreneurship (CE). Design/methodology/approach: The study uses agency theory as a framework to expand on the board dependence-CE relationship by injecting the moderating role of antitakeover provisions to the model. Using data collected from 350 publicly traded firms, a panel regression analyses was conducted on both innovation and venturing components of CE. Findings: The findings of this study show a negative relationship between board dependence and CE. Further this study shows that such a negative relationship becomes weaker when higher levels of antitakeover provisions are injected into the model. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted using a sample of large publicly traded firms within the information and manufacturing sectors, and so our findings may not be generalizable to firms in other contexts. Further, other variables representing CE (e.g. new product introductions) may add to this line of research in the future. Practical implications: Understanding the role of board of directors within a firm may help foster CE throughout the organization. Originality/value: This study expands on existing research by incorporating the influence of environmental factors (e.g. antitakeover provisions) and examining the relationship between corporate governance and CE using both measures of innovation and venturing.

The main aim of the present study is to determine the role of environmentally expert and experience leader on positive deviance behaviour in corporate environmental reporting practices. Based on the environmental reporting index develop based on the concept of positive environmental deviance, the study measured positive deviance behaviour in environmental reporting practices of 209 Malaysian public listed companies based on 5 years panel data. It was found that environmental expert and experience board of directors have a positive significant relationship with positive deviance in environmental reporting practices. Nevertheless it have been found that there were no significant relationship between environmentally expert and experience CEO and its interaction effect with environmentally expert and experience board of directors on positive deviance behaviour in environmentally reporting practices. This study conceptualized positive deviance behaviour in environmental reporting practices as the strategic behaviour of the corporations to improve the impact of environmental sustainability practices beyond the required regulations by disclosing set of information regarding to their proactive management practices and performance which: (1) exceed minimal norms; (2) deviate from others within the field; (3) go beyond what is required by regulation; and (4) associated broader scale changes.

Drawing on stewardship and resource dependence theories, we examine how the board of directors (BoD) influences the link between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and ambidextrous innovation in small and medium sized family firms (family SMEs). Our analysis of 230 Spanish family SMEs shows that family involvement in the BoD has a negative effect on their ability to turn EO into innovation. Moreover, we show that the BoD's strategic involvement in service and control tasks and the provision of knowledge and skills have positive effects, whereas the intensity of BoD activity has a surprisingly negative effect. These findings underscore that the effects of the BoD on the entrepreneurship-innovation link are more complex than previously thought, pointing to the important role of both BoD composition and BoD functioning for enabling innovation in family SMEs.

This study develops a combined agency-resource dependence perspective and applies it to the study of interlocking directorates. It suggests that interlocking directorates may exert either a positive or a negative effect on subsequent firm performance, depending on the firm's relative resources, power imbalance, ownership concentration, and CEO ownership. A test on a sample of 145 Italian companies provides support for hypothesized effects. This study suggests that integrating agency and resource dependence theories provides a higher-order explanation of firm performance and helps advance both agency and resource dependence theories.

We investigate the influence of the dual board structure on the financial performance of Islamic banks. The paper also investigates the unique agency relationships using a sample of 90 Islamic banks across 13 countries over the period 2006-2014. We find that the larger the Shari'ah Supervisory Board (SSB) the better the financial performance and this result reinforces the fundamental role of the SSB to certify permissible financial instruments and products. We also find evidence of the scope of operation hypothesis with respect to both the board of directors and the SSB as Islamic banks are characterised by a higher degree of complex operations. Interestingly, we find that a larger SSB size may result in lower agency costs and that the greater the size of the unrestricted contracts, the higher the agency costs. This implies that unrestricted profit-sharing contracts are one of the main sources of the unique agency relationships in Islamic banks. The paper has a number of policy implications for regulators including the design of governance mechanisms in Islamic banks and the dynamics of unrestricted contracts. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the effects of board diversity on bank profitability and risk. Using a sample of 97 Chinese banks over a period from 2009 to 2013, we find that board age diversity is negatively associated with bank profitability. To further investigate why age-diverse boards influence bank performance, we decompose board age diversity into diversity of directors' personal values, utilizing the World Values Survey. Our findings suggest that the heterogeneity among directors' views on risk, prudence, and wealth is more likely to spark intragroup conflicts in the decision-making process. This prevents the board from functioning effectively and ultimately weakens bank profitability. Our results are robust with respect to alternative measures of diversity and bank performance.

This paper investigates whether the characteristics of boards of directors and audit committees and the formation of the latter are associated with firm performance. Agency theory suggests that well-governed firms perform relatively better than their poorly-governed counterparts. However, resource dependency theory suggests that a board with more insider directors could have more expertise on how to better operate the firm, thus contributing to better firm performance. Using a sample of firms publicly traded on the Athens Stock Exchange during 2008-2012, we find that those having large-sized boards performed better, but firms having more independent board members performed poorly. We also find that firms with small-sized boards and those with boards having more independent members are more likely to form audit committees, but we failed to find any association between audit committee characteristics and firm performance. In addition, we do not find a negative relation between board independence and future firm performance. These findings suggest that boards of Greek firms take more active role in advising than monitoring. These findings have implications for policymakers, researchers, corporate managers, and investors, in general, and particularly, those in emerging markets. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate how gender diversity in top management - i.e. boardroom and top management positions - affects business performance among Colombian public businesses. Design/methodology/approach: Building on the upper echelon theory which emphasizes that gender in an important characteristic that influences top management's decision-making, panel data models are used on a sample of 54 Colombian public businesses for the period 2008-2015 to test the proposed hypotheses relating to gender diversity and subsequent business performance. Findings: The results support that gender diversity is positively associated with subsequent business performance. More concretely, the relationship between gender diversity at the top of the corporate hierarchy - in the present case, as CEO and in the top management team - and subsequent performance becomes more evident when performance is linked to business operations (ROA), whereas the positive effect of women's representation in the boardroom and subsequent performance is significant when performance is measured via shareholder-oriented metrics (ROE). Originality/value: Few studies have addressed the role of gender diversity on performance in developing economies. This study contributes to better understand how gender diversity affects performance in contexts where women are underrepresented in the top management, and where the appointment of women directors or managers is not driven by regulatory pressures.

Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the impact of board characteristics on the financial performance of listed firms in Tanzania. Board characteristics, including outside directors, board size, CEO/Chair duality, gender diversity, board skill and foreign directors are addressed in the Tanzanian context by applying two corporate governance theories, namely, agency theory and resource dependence theory. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses balanced panel data regression analysis on 80 firm-years observations (2006-2013) from annual reports, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 key stakeholders. The study uses also a mixed methods approach and applies a convergent parallel design (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2011) to integrate quantitative and qualitative data. Findings: It was found that in terms of agency theory, while the findings support the separation of CEO/Chairperson roles, they do not support outside directors-financial performance linkage. With regard to resource dependence theory, the findings suggest that gender diversity has a positive impact on financial performance. Furthermore, the findings do not support an association between financial performance and board size, PhD qualification and foreign directors. Practical implications: The study contributes to the understanding of board-performance link and provides academic evidence to policy makers in Tanzania for current and future governance reforms. Originality/value: The findings contribute to the literature by providing new and original insights that, within a developing setting, extend current understanding of the association between corporate governance and financial performance. This is predicated, also, on the use of uncommon mixed methods approach. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Debates around sound corporate governance propose board diversity as a key attribute to sufficiently challenge executive management for stakeholder engagement. This study contributes to this debate by empirically investigating the effect of board diversity on corporate social disclosure (CSD) of Vietnamese listed firms. The study finds a significantly positive effect of diversity-in-boards (dissimilarities among directors within a board, i.e., demographic attributes of board members) on CSD while diversity-of-boards (dissimilarities among firm boards, i.e., board structure) has no effect on CSD. The results contribute by showing that a single theoretical approach can provide an adequate explanation for board diversity. The study contributes methodologically by demonstrating the design and measurement of board diversity indices, and a three-dimensional stakeholder-relevant CSD index. The findings benefit regulators and corporate executives in better understanding firms' CSD practices and stakeholders' expectations. (c) 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Scholars have expressed concern that marketing's influence at the strategic levels of the firm is waning. Consistent with this view, only 2.6% of firms' board members have marketing experience. The authors suggest that this is shortsighted and that including more marketing-experienced board members (MEBMs) will increase firm growth by (1) helping firms prioritize growth as a strategic objective and (2) contributing their expertise to improve the effectiveness of revenue growth strategies. Drawing on the behavioral model of corporate governance, the authors develop a theoretical framework explicating the situational, dispositional, and structural influence moderators that alter the impact ofMEBMs on firm growth. Using 64,086 director biographies from S&P 1500 firms, the authors find thatMEBMs positively affect firm-level revenue growth and that this relationship is strengthened or weakened by important contingencies that occur in the firm. The findings suggest that the common practice of not including experienced marketers on boards of directors puts firms at a competitive disadvantage. (c) 2018 American Marketing Association.

Entrepreneurial success in family SMEs is largely determined by the knowledge, skills, and new ideas contributed by board directors, the most important actors in the formulation of corporate strategy and decision making. The composition of family SME boards has traditionally been homogeneous, as such boards usually comprise male family members. Boards' contributions, however, depend on their level of diversity and strategic involvement. This study analyzes the moderating effects of two main sources of board diversity in family firms, family involvement level and gender diversity, as potential means of enhancing family firms' success when exploiting entrepreneurial initiatives. This study also explores whether these two potential moderators depend on the strategic involvement of the board directors. Based on a sample of 230 Spanish family firms, we found that the link between entrepreneurial orientation and performance is stronger in firms with lower levels of family involvement and higher levels of gender diversity in the board. Moreover, the board's high strategic involvement may strengthen the positive impact of gender diversity and change the moderating influence of family involvement from negative to positive.

Following the attention-based view of the firm (ABV), boards of directors' link to corporate sustainable development (CSD) could be dependent upon certain attention structures: valuation of environmental stimuli, rules of the game and the players. Studying a sample of large Australian firms, the findings indicate that the proposed attention-directing structures do appear to be linked to CSD in a manner consistent with the ABV. Specifically, creating awareness through scanning efforts links boards to CSD. Stakeholder debate, as a boardroom rule, is also significantly associated with CSD. Furthermore, as a so-called 'player' on the board, women directors have a moderating effect on the relationships between environmental scanning, stakeholder debate and CSD. The findings are discussed along with limitations and directions for future research. Copyright (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

We draw on a phenomenological model of institutional theory to explore how sub-national policies shape corporate board gender diversity of publicly traded firms. Using a sample of S&P 1500 firms in 49 U.S. states from 2003 to 2014, we find that firms headquartered in states with progressive policies that protect women from discrimination and provide greater availability of emergency contraception and public funding for abortions have greater shares of women directors in their board of directors. Our findings hold after a series of robustness checks and offer implications for theory, policy, and practice. (c) 2018

Drawing from corporate governance research and social identity theory, the authors argue that the relationship between outside directors' time in office and outside director task involvement is more complex than generally anticipated. By using a unique multisource data set composed of peer ratings provided by fellow outside directors rating a focal director's task involvement, this study analyzes director task involvement at the individual director level of analysis. The authors propose and empirically demonstrate that outside director tenure has an inverted U-shaped relationship with outside director task involvement that is moderated by a director's social identification with the organization. As such, the authors demonstrate that social identification with the organization provides a critical contingency for the curvilinear relationship between outside director tenure and outside director task involvement. Findings suggest that outside directors who socially identify with the organization are more likely to grow "stale in the saddle" at lower levels of tenure. These findings provide support for the merit of analyzing outside directors at the individual level of analysis and suggest that a "one-size-fits-all" approach may not be most appropriate in assessing the effects of tenure on outside director functioning.

Despite substantive organizational ramifications, surprisingly little theory explains executive succession planning processes. A firm's board of directors has the fiduciary responsibility to select CEOs, but, historically, boards have failed to exercise this authority. Increasing focus on corporate governance has prompted directors to become more engaged in organizational management, but boards face significant barriers to gathering and processing information. However, there is a dearth of research examining how boards overcome informational barriers to enhance decision-making effectiveness. Accordingly, the current study integrates procedural rationality in decision-making with research on boards as information-processing groups to explore how and why boards conduct succession planning processes. Procedural rationality results in formalized processes designed to collect essential information about CEO succession candidates; these processes, in turn, lead to a greater quantity and quality of CEO succession candidates. We also illustrate how CEOs can influence the effectiveness of board information gathering and processing. The tests of the theoretically generated hypotheses rely on in-depth qualitative interviews, coupled with unique survey and archival data from 355 firm-year observations of 218 large organizations, collected over three years.

Using the Heckman two-stage method, this study empirically investigates whether board directors' work experience in government and multinational corporations (MNCs), as well as the proportion of outside directors affects export propensity and export performance based on a sample of Korean firms. We find that the Korean firms with former government officials on the board are more likely to engage in exporting, although there is no empirical evidence supporting export performance. The findings also show that firms with former MNC employees on the board demonstrate higher levels of export propensity and export performance. Similarly, firms with a higher proportion of outside directors exhibit a higher level of export propensity and export performance. These findings highlight the importance of the board of directors in Korean firms' first stage of internationalization and provide new insights into which type of board members can benefit their firms in terms of export propensity and export performance.

The aim of this research is to examine what impact female institutional directors on boards have on corporate performance. Previous research shows that institutional female directors cannot be considered as a homogeneous group since they represent investors who may or may not maintain business relations with the companies on whose corporate boards they sit. Thus, it is not only the effect of female institutional directors as a whole on firm value that has been analysed, but also the impact of pressure-resistant female directors, who represent institutional investors (investment, pension and mutual funds) that only invest in the company, and do not maintain a business relation with the firm. We hypothesize that there is a non-linear association, specifically quadratic, between institutional and pressure-resistant female directors on boards and corporate performance. Our results report that female institutional directors on boards enhance corporate performance, but when they reach a certain threshold on boards (11.72 %), firm value decreases. In line with female institutional directors, pressure-resistant female directors on boards also increase firm value, but only up to a certain figure (12.71 % on boards), above which they have a negative impact on firm performance. These findings are consistent with an inverted U-shaped relationship between female institutional directors and pressure-resistant female directors and firm performance.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze, in the Colombian developing context, the relationship between the presence of women in corporate positions and the financial performance of the company and to know if there are differences between family and non-family firms. Design/methodology/approach: Building on the contingency theory of leadership, which emphasizes that leader's personality and the situation in which that leader operates influences corporate decision-making, the authors use panel data models on a sample of 54 Colombian public businesses for the period 2008-2015 to test the proposed hypotheses on the relationship between women's presence in corporate governance positions and financial performance, as well as the difference between family and non-family firms. Findings: The results support that women's presence in corporate governance positions is positively associated with firm performance. More concretely, the authors find a relationship between women at the top corporate governance structure (as part of the board of directors, top management team and chief executive officer) and firm profitability. Results also indicate that family business, as a type of organization, (negatively) moderates the positive relationship between female participation in top executive positions (board and top executive team) and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: First, this study is limited to women in corporate positions in large companies listed on the Colombia Stock Exchange, and thus, generalizability for smaller entities may be limited. Second, data limitations do not allow us to investigate ways in which women's presence in corporate governance structures contributes to improve firm goals. Practical implications: The authors provide support to the hypothesis that positively relates women's presence in corporate governance positions and firm performance for the case of Colombia. This serves as a guidance to Colombian regulators, corporate decision-makers and policy-makers to promote the inclusion of women in top hierarchical structures through either mandatory laws or recommendation. Originality/value: Few studies have addressed the women's presence in corporate governance positions and contribution to firm performance in developing economies. This study contributes to better understand how women impact performance in contexts where women are underrepresented in corporate governance structure and where there are no laws that pressure firms to appoint women in corporate governance positions.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to synthesize the diverse literature on board demographic diversity and to provide avenues for future research. Design/methodology/approach: The study provides a comprehensive literature review of theoretical and empirical studies published in leading management journals from 1989 to 2015. Findings: The literature review revealed several aspects that are related to board demographic diversity. These aspects have been classified into: definitions and types of board diversity, dimensions of board demographic diversity, measurement and outcomes of board diversity, reasons for existing conflicting empirical findings about the relationship between board diversity and firm dynamics, and research on mediators and moderators. Originality/value: Issues pertaining to board demographic diversity identified in this paper have theoretical and practical implications, and include avenues for future research.

Research summary: We examine the consequences of the formalization of the board leadership structure at IPO for board-level turnover. We introduce the concept of director undervaluation. It indicates the degree to which a director's qualifications based on normatively accepted criteria for board leadership are not duly reflected in his/her appointments to the board chair and committee chair positions. We find that the higher the average undervaluation of directors on the board ("board undervaluation"), the greater the turnover levels of undervalued directors. This effect is stronger when board interaction frequency is higher. We contribute to the behavioral perspective on corporate governance by introducing justice-based legitimacy as a key normative institution, and by providing a novel predictor of aggregate turnover of directors (as well as the firm's CEO). Managerial summary: Why do outside directors exit the board? We offer a novel answer to this question in the context of newly public firms. We suggest that when directors are passed over for the board chair and committee chair positions despite having higher qualifications than their peers, they have been "undervalued," and a negative board climate is likely to develop. We find that the higher the average undervaluation of directors on the board, the higher the turnover levels of these undervalued directors. More frequent board meetings exacerbate these turnover levels. Further, these turnover effects are not restricted to undervalued directors--even the CEO is more likely to exit. This study demonstrates the critical importance of developing a legitimate and fair board leadership structure. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Boards operate notionally in a liminal, nonhierarchical space, neither inside the company nor outside, creating ambiguity between service and control functions and fostering tolerance of it. With repeated corporate governance crises, however, new prescriptions institutionalized in law, regulation, and codes of conduct have added significance to the control side, marked by monitoring and compliance tasks. Taking a cue from the strategy process and strategy-as-practice literature, this study revisits the work of directors on the service side: their engagement in strategizing. Formalization of board processes has led to greater structure and reduced the liminality of the board. Using interviews with 20 directors from a range of organization types, this study finds that directors experiment respond to increased institutionalization of board practice by seeking out new liminal spaces and informal practices, with implications for theory of boards, board activities, and public policy.

While academic researchers continue to debate the effect of board independence in increasing performance, its efficacy could also be reflected in whether firm performance is made more stable. Board governance activities are a constellation of actions aimed at managing agency costs and ensuring the viability of a company over time. The efficacy of such actions would, therefore, be reflected in a distal outcome, specifically, in lower firm performance variability. Boards that can control agency costs and limit both underinvestment and overinvestment would reduce a firm's deviation from its mean performance trajectory. Using a longitudinal sample of publicly traded companies in the United States, we find that board stability, board resource provision, and CEO influence are negatively associated with performance variability. Board independence is not associated with performance variability. With increasing board independence, greater board stability and greater CEO influence are negatively associated with performance variability, however, greater board resource provision is not associated with performance variability.

This study examines if the effort of financially linked independent (FLI) directors enable firms to reemerge from bankruptcy, a major organizational crisis. Using a sample of 307 bankrupt U.S. firms with instrumental variables regression methodology, I find that the efforts of these directors are critical for firm reemergence. FLI directors' efforts increase the likelihood of reemergence as well as improve access to financial resources. In contrast, I do not find any evidence that non-FLI directors' efforts are associated with reemergence. I also find that resourceful but uninvolved directors are not helpful for firms trying to navigate their way out of bankruptcy. My study highlights (a) the changing nature of roles played by directors in various lifecycle stages, (b) the greater importance of resource provisioning over monitoring during reemergence, and (c) that efforts of FLI directors, and not others director categories, matter for reemergence. Overall, my study extends research that suggests directors' motivation may cause differential firm outcomes and provides evidence that directors do not always put in their best effort on behalf of their firms. This, I suggest, has profound implications for corporate governance research and practice. (c) The Author(s) 2016.

Upper echelons (UE) theory posits that organisational performance reflects the personal values and cognitive frames of the top management team (TMT) and, crucially, that greater heterogeneity in individual backgrounds of senior executives leads to better outcomes. However, often missing from this research is a more developed account of how this relationship between the characteristics of TMTs and performance is also mediated by internal conditions within organisations. In this paper we begin to address this deficiency focusing on the mediating impact of employee satisfaction and the styles and practices of line managers. Looking at the empirical case of English National Health Services acute care hospital trusts, we use a multiple mediation model to analyse the relationship between board heterogeneity, performance and these two (internal) organisational factors. A variance-based structural equation modelling approach (partial least square) is applied to a sample of 102 boards of directors. First, the results lend support to the UE hypothesis that there is a positive impact of board heterogeneity and hos-pital-level performance. Second, the analysis shows that the relationship heterogeneity-performance is positively influenced by: (a) the styles and practices of line managers; (b) the levels of staff satisfaction; and by their mutually reinforcing roles.

Two key groups central to improving firm performance are the top management team (TMT) and the board of directors. Executives undertake strategic actions, whereas board members fulfill their resource provision and monitoring roles. Drawing on tournament theory and equity theory, we propose that high pay dispersion among outside directors and the TMT is positively associated with strategic risk, whereas high (low) TMT pay dispersion and low (high) outside director pay dispersion are positively associated with firm performance. Our predictor is the unexplained component of horizontal pay dispersion, or the residual of pay dispersion resulting from regressing pay on observable firm, industry, period, and individual characteristics. Our results highlight the importance of unexplained pay dispersion for TMTs, but not for boards of directors, in improving firm performance. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This study illustrates how control-ownership wedge impacts the monitoring role of the corporate board through the quality of audit services in Turkey. Turkey has made essential amendments in the field of external audit in order to enhance the quality of the financial report and integrate its own capital market with that of the EU. It would be of interest to examine the influence of these changes on clients' demand for high quality audit. The agency theory is integrated with the resource dependence theory to show that boards possess distinct incentives and ability to demand high quality audit to monitor management activities. Logistic regression and feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) were used for regression estimations. The results indicate that board demographics, cognitive and structural diversity of board of directors, audit committee characteristics and audit quality are complementary and control-ownership wedge weakens the relationship between them which is an unfavorable outcome for minority shareholders. Thus, this study proposes that regulators should increase law enforcement to enhance good corporate governance in Turkey to accommodate the unique features of wedge firms and provide a protected environment for minority shareholders.

Using a panel dataset of non-financial public companies in Italy covering the period 2005-2013, this paper provides an empirical analysis of the relationship between female representation on corporate boards and corporate debt. The presence of women in the boardroom might seem to push significantly on debt leverage and suggest a complementary role in the control and monitoring of agency costs. However, consistent with Kanter's (Am J Sociol 82(5), 965-990, 1977) critical mass theory, that at a level of tokenism women take on a complementary role and at greater levels, their role either becomes a substitute for debt level, or plays a weaker complementary role in debt level and in the monitoring of agency costs. The presence of women board members who are linked to the family firm appears to significantly decrease the degree of debt leverage. Furthermore, the presence of greater female representation in the boardroom decreases the agency costs to the firm. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Gender diversity in family firms is increasingly attracting the attention of scholars across several fields. Despite this, there are few literature reviews that synthesize these research streams in the context of family businesses. To fill this gap, we examined the literature on gender diversity on the boards of family businesses by providing some insights into how the typical traits of family firms' boards interact with the diversity effects linked to the presence of women. This analysis is the starting point for identifying possible research areas not yet addressed by scholars, and therefore defining the research agenda on the subject. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

This article addresses the issue of sustainability of Italian opera houses by focusing on the relationship between board composition and organizational performance. Integrating agency and resource dependence theory, the authors develop a taxonomy of board profiles for opera houses and test the impact of both individual profiles and board diversity on the performance of Italian Lyric Symphonic Foundations (LSFs). They posit that different profiles will affect theatres' revenue structure differently, as each profile drives specific types of revenue, such as earned income, private funds and public funds. In order to empirically test their hypotheses, they perform a panel data analysis with fixed-effects and bootstrap resampling (N = 5,000) and robust clustered errors around theatres over an 11-year period (2001-12). While the literature stresses the crucial role of all board members in orienting an organization's performance, these new findings show the importance of different board profiles in affecting LSF revenue structure. The authors conclude that the board of directors can and should be mobilized to ensure the organization's growth. (c) 2018 Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC), Montreal.

We propose and test a theory of board discretion in the context of the board's selection of a female CEO. We propose that boards also have discretion, an area that has typically focused exclusively on managers, and examine the conditions under which boards, facing high levels of uncertainty, have the latitude to make nontraditional choices, particularly when a negative equity market reaction to such a selection is likely. In the context of the nontraditional choice of a female CEO successor, we observe that the strong financial health of the firm and boardroom and situation-specific experience grant the board the discretion to select a female CEO. We test our model using all Standard & Poors (S&P) 1500 firms that experienced a CEO succession between 2000 and 2013. Implications for practice and research are discussed. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

What role does the board of directors play in fostering organisational innovation? This study contributes to this conversation by exploring the relationship between board characteristics and business model innovation adoption. Drawing from resource dependence theory and using the smart home business model as our context, we examined the relationship among board size, CEO duality and proportion of outside directors on the likelihood of business model innovation adoption. Our analysis of 96 firms indicates that both board size and CEO duality significantly increase the likelihood of business model innovation adoption. Our findings highlight the important resource provision role boards play in promoting organisational innovation. (c) 2018 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact that PhD scientists serving on the board of directors of firms conducting hard science have on the R&D-based innovative performance of the firm. Design/methodology/approach: The research hypotheses are built upon extant theory, and they are tested using two-stage least squared regression that control for the endogenous nature of board composition. Results are robust to alternative specifications. Findings: This analysis shows that firms with higher numbers of PhD scientists on the board generate superior innovative output and more efficient monitoring; PhD board members with denser professional networks are more valuable as board members. Practical implications: This paper provides practical advice to innovative firms on how to create a governance process that simultaneously improves monitoring and boosts the innovative performance. Originality/value: This study is the first one to suggest that innovative firms can improve R&D monitoring and boost innovative output at the same time, and the first to investigate the role that PhD scientists can serve on the board of firms engaging in hard science.

In small and medium-sized organizations, boards of directors often spend most of their time providing advice to the management. As the content of advice provided has seldom been the focus of previous studies, we differentiate between functional and firm-specific advisory tasks. We examine antecedents of the two types to explain why this differentiation is important. Applying group effectiveness arguments, we study the effects board members' different knowledge bases and diversity have on the two advisory tasks, considering the mediating effects of board processes. Our results suggest that it is important to distinguish between different types of board members' knowledge and different board advisory tasks. Our findings have direct implications for research and practice. First, there is a need to go beyond the surface level understanding of what boards are doing. Second, our results emphasize the importance of organizational knowledge, and hence question the call for independent board members for advice provision. (c) 2017 European Academy of Management

International Business (IB) research has surveyed firms' internationalization by examining the geographical dispersion of their sales and assets. However, less attention has been devoted to an important facet of their internationalization: the globalization of boards of directors. Drawing on institutional theory, we study the determinants of board foreign diversity by focusing on firms' sub-national socio-cultural context. We theorize on factors such as: attitudes toward immigration and conservatism that may impact the legitimacy of certain governance practices and may exert an influence on firms' propensity to internationalize their boards. Using a sample of S&P1500 from 2004 to 2014, we find support for our theory after using several controls. By bringing to the fore the interplay between sub-national factors and the globalization of boards, our study offers several implications for IB research. More broadly, our research delves into factors related to firms' sub-national environment that are likely to challenge their internationalization. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Strategic decision-making processes influence firm-level outcomes. Using the theory of upper echelons, this study investigates how diversity in directors' skills, knowledge, and industry experience influence board decision-making processes that may impact overall strategic decision-making processes. Such diversity has been commonly accepted to be a 'double-edged sword'--enhancing comprehensiveness but hindering the speed of decision-making. On the contrary, we used an existing large survey database to show that directors' diverse educational background, functional background, and industry experience (job-related diversity) have a positive effect on comprehensiveness as well as the speed of board decision-making. In addition, our results indicate that board processes (directors' use of their knowledge and skills) play an important role by transmitting the positive effects of diversity. The study is in a tradition of exploring how boards may influence firms' strategic decision-making processes. Our findings provide additional arguments for adding job-related diversity to boards of directors. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

This article investigates whether the presence of advisory directors and monitoring directors varies across firm life cycle stages. We follow a parsimonious life cycle proxy based on the predicted behaviour of operating, investing and financing cash flows across the different life cycle stages that result from firm performance and the allocation of resources. Using an Australian sample, this study shows that compared to mature-stage firms, firms in the introduction, shake-out and decline stages have more advisory directors. With respect to the demand for monitoring directors, we find that compared to mature-stage firms, firms in the introduction, shake-out and decline stages have fewer monitoring directors on the board. We contribute to the literature on boards of directors by documenting that firms choose an optimal board structure based on their economic characteristics. JEL Classification: D22, G38, M14.

Using data from China's listed privately owned enterprises (POEs) during the period from 2002 to 2014, we explore the effects of firm life cycle on board structure. We find that the board size of China's listed POEs declines over firm life cycle, and there is a trend of separation for board chair-CEO duality while board independence remains almost static. We further provide evidence that board size and independence are determined by the benefits of monitoring and advisory roles of the boards through all the stages of firms' life cycle with different drivers. The impact of CEO power on board chair-CEO duality is determined by the benefits and costs of separation of board chair, and CEOs are supported at all stages of firms' life cycle. This article sheds light on the dynamic board structure in an emerging economy where the external corporate governance is weaker than that of developed countries. Our findings suggest that the board structures of China's listed POEs are adjusted at various stages of firms' life cycle, and the adjustments are mostly based on the resources brought by the new board of directors.

Board diversity has been the recurring theme for discussions both in the academic and corporate environments. The concept of diversity is broad and encompasses not only gender and ethnic variety, but also the diversity of cultural, social, and professional aspects. This research aims to contribute to the understanding of the influence of company boards on corporate policies, by analyzing the effects of board diversity on firms' financial/ capital structure decisions. The results suggest that board diversity improves monitoring effectiveness and is positively related with firm leverage, in line with the effects of reduction of managerial entrenchment by means of stronger monitoring.

Firm performance is a major concern for all organizations and involves a multitude of antecedents. Reducing environmental uncertainty and dependency through the use of strategic actions in the resource dependency theory (RDT) framework and enhancing work practices through high performance work systems (HPWS) lead to higher levels of firm performance. We reveal the interconnectivity between RDT and HPWS and develop propositions as to how components of HPWS positively moderate the relationship between firm performance and the environmental uncertainty-reducing strategic actions proposed by RDT such as mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, boards of directors, political action, and executive succession.

Gender equality on boards is a global and highly politicized issue. To this day, there is considerable cross-country variation in female board representation. We examine institutional supply- and demand-side factors associated with this issue. Our results indicate that a societal climate of gender equality contributes to more women on boards, mainly through fostering the supply of suitable candidates. Therefore, the glass ceiling should be improved through a societal supply-side effort which needs to complement demand-side (quota) regulation. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies have been unable to establish a clear relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance. We argue that this could be due to the failure of these studies to account for both the endogeneity problem and the possible nonlinearity of the relationship between board diversity and firm performance. We overcome these problems by studying the investor reaction at the announcement of a female director's departure. We find a negative market reaction only when this departure drops the gender diversity below a critical level of three women. In all other cases, a director's departure has no significant impact on shareholder wealth. This result is consistent with the assumption of value in diversity and critical mass theory.

Using a legitimacy lens, we theorize that changes in the firm's board of directors parallel the evolving stakeholder audience that accords legitimacy to the firm--a key resource to the firm's survival. Powerful new stakeholders post- initial public offering (IPO) such as the listing exchange and the securities regulators are anticipated to impact board gender diversity through their regulatory pressure, while pre-IPO investors such as venture capitalists are reducing their equity positions and thus providing opportunities for director turnover. At the same time, the firm is increasing in size and visibility, building additional sociocultural legitimacy pressures for increased gender diversity. While prior research centers on the effect of different types and intensity of legitimacy pressures on board characteristics, we explore how changes in the question of firms' legitimacy "to whom" affects board composition, that is, we examine the comparative effect of regulation and society on board composition. We test our hypotheses by analyzing panel data for all North American technology firms doing IPOs on the NASDAQ exchange during a 12-year time frame between 1997 and 2011. Our analysis shows that regulation, although not explicitly directive, can play a key role in accelerating board gender diversity.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine whether a private firm's demand for a Big4 auditor is influenced by the auditor choice of its main supplier, customer and competitor. The authors rely on institutional theory to explain this stakeholders' influence. The authors also examine whether the extent to which the firm's board of directors engages in networking moderates this influence. Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaire data are combined with archival data of 210 Belgian private firms with a statutory audit requirement. Logistic regression analysis is applied to examine to what extent firms follow their main competitor, customer and supplier in hiring a Big4 auditor. Findings: The results reveal a positive association between the firm's choice of a Big4 auditor and its main supplier being audited by a Big4 auditor, supporting the conformance effect (isomorphism) toward suppliers as hypothesized by institutional theory. The extent of board networking, however, seems to weaken this effect. Toward competitors, a divergence effect instead of a conformance effect is found, which indicates the existence of competitive differentiation regarding auditor choice. Research limitations/implications: While prior studies mainly focus on the agency relationships between shareholders, debtholders and managers to explain auditor choice, this study also takes into account the firm's other main stakeholders by relying on institutional theory. Both the conformance effect toward suppliers as well as the divergence effect toward competitors provide interesting additional perspectives on why auditors are demanded, leading to interesting future research opportunities. Originality/value: This paper fulfills an identified need to consider additional theories in explaining audit outcomes. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Despite that fact that Iraq has gone very far in the liberalization of women, Iraqi board of directors is still dominated by men. However, gender diversity is one of the largest concepts of board diversity and a major issue within corporate governance where several studies seek to discover the influence of diversity on firm performance. This article aims at examining the effect of women representation on firm performance of Iraqi listed firms using panel regression analysis. The empirical results of this paper provide evidence of a positive and significant relationship between female directors and firm performance as measured by Return on Assets while no relationship with the Tobin's q. The important policy implication of this finding is that the Iraqi Stock Exchange and Iraqi Security Commission should incorporate gender diversity in CG practices and encourage women directorship in Iraq.

Directors of firms are theorized to fulfil control, service and resource dependence roles. However, the ways in which directors' of Chinese MNCs govern their foreign subsidiaries, and perform these roles remains unclear. Building on the institutional logics perspective, this study explores the roles enacted by the boards of directors eight Chinese-controlled companies in Australia to gain an appreciation of their governance practices. In depth semi-structured interviews with insider and independent directors, consultants and market analysts were undertaken. A content analysis of company annual reports and web sites complimented primary sources of data on board functions. Findings reveal that control is the most dominant role played by these boards, rather than service or resource dependence. It also appears that the dominant logics of Chinese institutions influence the corporate governance of Chinese MNCs as they internationalize. These findings extend our understanding of corporate governance practices in China and abroad. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The study examined the linear and curvilinear relationships between the number of women on boards and corporate social responsibility (CSR) among medium- to large-sized publicly listed for-profit companies in Australia. The relationship was predicted as positive linear based on the resource dependence theory (RDT) and inverted U-shaped based on the integration of RDT and group structure theory. The results show a positive linear relationship between women on boards and CSR, whereas the curvilinear relationship was not significant. Our findings suggest that the presence of women on boards increases the organizations' focus towards the CSR activities. Future research might consider the impact of women on boards on CSR in different cultural contexts or by segmenting population based on industry type.

Purpose: This study aims to use the original data collected from school board members representing nonprofit charter schools in the state of Minnesota to examine the relationship between the distribution of board-executive governance responsibilities and the performance of organizations operating as part of a New Public Management style macro-governance reform. Design/methodology/approach: A combination of survey data collected from Minnesota charter school board members and hard performance data were utilized in two OLS regression models to predict the link between organizational governance and school performance. Findings: The authors find that boards can improve hard measures of organizational performance by shifting responsibility of day-to-day operations closer to the executive, and public advocacy duties closer to the board. The results build on the existing literatures on school board governance and board-executive relations. Overall, the findings suggest the existence of an ideal balance between board-executive governance responsibilities in key functional areas on charter school boards. Originality/value: Though a healthy literature exists regarding the value of charter schools, very few studies have actually explored the way in which these organizations are governed. This study is the first to link charter board governance responsibilities to performance. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Employing a synthesis model, this chapter examines the relationship between board structure and board processes within family firms. By reviewing the family firm governance literature from the past 20 years, we apply the Ilgen et al. (Annu Rev Psychol 56:517-543, 2005) input-mediator-output-input framework to identify heterogeneous family processes which ultimately impact the forming, functioning, and finishing stages of boards of directors in family firms. In doing so, we help to answer questions of why family firm boards are effective rather than what predicts board effectiveness, as well as provide guidance for future research.

The paper analyzes the pervasiveness of family board memberships within family business groups (FBGs), which are large and diversified form of family businesses dominant in emerging economies. The data pertain to 2017 and include board information on 640 firms affiliated to the largest 26 FBGs in Turkey. The study cluster analyzes the FBGs according to family involvement in their governance. Derived from different theoretical lenses, it also aims to identify the variables that condition different clusters. Results show that several decades after liberalization, families still control the groups pervasively though with varying degrees. Regarding the extent of family involvement in governance, different clusters are identified as tight control, vertical control, and loose control. Ownership structure emerges as the main antecedent that differentiates FBGs in different clusters. (c) 2018 Universidad de Malaga. All Rights Reserved.

Recently, foreigners have been responsible for negotiating more than half of the shares issued by the companies listed in the Brazilian Stock Market. In order to understand the characteristics of companies that influence the increase of international financing, the aim of this article was to investigate the relation between foreign investment in public offerings and board composition. We examine data of 183 Brazilian IPOs and subsequent offerings from 2004-2016 using OLS regression. The empirical result suggested that companies that have a foreign director as a board member and are in a special listing segment of B3--bound by rules of corporate governance--tend to attract more foreign investment. This means that foreigners are sensitive to good corporate governance practices when financing Brazilian firms' IPOs or that issue new shares. Our findings imply that improvements in the corporate governance practice of companies could increase their ability to raise foreign capital. RESUMERecientemente, mas de la mitad de las acciones emitidas por las empresas cotizadas en la Bolsa de Valores brasilena fueron negociadas por extranjeros. El objeto de este estudio consistio en investigar la relacion existente entre las inversiones extranjeras en las ofertas publicas y la composicion de sus juntas directivas, para entender las caracteristicas de las empresas que contribuyen a aumentar el financiamiento internacional. Utilizando la regresion de minimos cuadrados ordinarios dinamicos (MCOD, OLS en ingles), examinamos datos de la Oferta Publica Inicial Brasilena 183 (IPO) asi como ofertas subsiguientes del periodo 2004-2016. El resultado empirico obtenido sugiere que las empresas cuya junta directiva tiene como miembro un director extranjero y constan en un segmento de cotizacion especial (B3), sujeto a normas de gobernanza corporativa, suelen atraer mas inversiones extranjeras. Esto implica que, al financiarlas, los extranjeros son mas susceptibles a que las empresas brasilenas que abren su capital o emiten nuevas acciones, usen buenas practicas de gobernanza corporativa. Nuestros hallazgos sugieren que la implementacion de mejoras en las practicas de gobernanza corporativa de las empresas puede aumentar su financiamiento internacional. RESUMORecentemente os estrangeiros passaram a ser responsaveis pela negociacao de mais da metade das acoes emitidas pelas empresas listadas na Bolsa de Valores brasileira. Para entender as caracteristicas das empresas que influenciam o aumento do financiamento internacional, o presente trabalho tem como objetivo o estudo da relacao entre o investimento estrangeiro nas ofertas publicas e a composicao das diretorias. Examinamos dados de 183 IPOs (Oferta Publica Inicial) e de ofertas subsequentes, de 2004 a 2016, usando a regressao MQO (OLS na sigla em ingles). O resultado empirico sugere que as empresas que tem um diretor estrangeiro na diretoria e que estao no segmento de listagem especial da B3--sujeitas as normas de governanca corporativa--tendem a atrair mais investimentos. Isso significa que os estrangeiros estao alerta quanto as boas praticas de governanca ao considerar empresas brasileiras que abrem o capital ou que emitem acoes novas. Os nossos achados sugerem que melhorias nas praticas de governanca corporativa das empresas podem elevar o financiamento internacional das empresas. (c) 2018, (c) 2018 Taylor & Francis.

This paper examines the effect of key board distinctiveness on managerial risk-taking behaviour. Using a total sample of 121 firms made up of 1,166 corporate directors and 847 firm-year observations, the study finds robust evidence across the three stages of estimation that suggests power separation in terms of CEO non-duality is negatively associated with executive risk-taking due to enhanced board assertiveness and independence. Board size is inversely associated with the variability of market value measure both within and at inter-firm levels. With average board membership in the study sample made up of 10 directors, the study finds crucial empirical evidence that points to the key benefits of large board configuration including the social capital, diversity of thoughts, knowledge, and experience, effectiveness and vigilance which curtails executive entrenchment. In contrast, the paper records positive association between the presence of foreign directors and corporate risk-taking. Due to their wealth of experiences, foreign directors tend to have more strategic sense of purpose and are likely not to hesitate in taking appropriate risk decisions when it really matters. While the paper finds little evidence that suggests a within-firm positive relationship between board independence and managerial risky propensities, there was no evidence found to indicate that board quality and ethnic diversity affects corporate risk-taking.

Gender diversity in corporate governance is a popular topic in management environment studies. One of the most significant components of this concept is women in boards. Due to the inequalities of women in boards there are a number of academic studies on women in top management. This chapter explains gender diversification problem in boards. Furthermore, reasons for workforce diversity in decision-making levels are determined. The role and critical mass of women members in different cultures are discussed. Finally, it introduces the representation levels of women in the boards of BIST 100 companies in Turkey. Data is obtained from annual reports, websites, and related documents of companies.

Purpose: The purpose of the study is to examine the interaction between the structure of the top management team, takeover defense mechanisms and firms rate of collective actions. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses elements of agency theory, prospect theory and competitive dynamics research to develop a model for examining heterogeneity in the rate of collective actions among firms in the technology sector. A sample of 299 firm-year observations arrayed into panel regression analyses is used. Findings: The findings from this study show a positive relationship between the size of the top management team and the count of collective actions when takeover defense mechanisms are present. Further this study finds a negative relationship between top management team ownership and collective actions when these same takeover defense mechanisms are present. Additionally, the female ratio of the top management team is negatively related to collective actions. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted using a sample of technological firms. These relationships may not be generalizable to firms in other contexts. Further, other elements of the firm's governance structure (i.e. board of directors or shareholders) may play an important role in the strategic decision-making process. Originality/value: This study expands on existing research by linking several blocks of literature, top management team literature, competitive dynamics literature and corporate governance literature, into a model to examine firm structural characteristics on the heterogeneity in the propensity to formulate collective actions among firms.

This study empirically examines the relationship between wide-ranging board diversity and the quality of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure variables in Malaysia. We extend prior literature covering broader dimensions of board diversity (e.g., gender, education level, education background, age, tenure, nationality and ethnicity) and their impact on CSR after controlling for board and audit committee characteristics. Using 200 listed firms in Bursa Malaysia during 2009-2013 and applying both OLS and 2SLS instrumental variables (IV) approaches, we document significant positive effect of board education level and board tenure diversity on the quality of CSR disclosure. Further analysis using robust regression also shows positive association between gender diversity and CSR disclosure. Our findings also demonstrate that the quality of CSR disclosure is significantly negatively associated with board age and nationality diversity. These results remain consistent with using alternative measures for board diversity, and characteristics for board of director and audit committees as well as split samples between large and small firms. Additional tests exhibit complementary relationship of education level and nationality with gender, while substitutive relationship of age and tenure with gender in influencing CSR. These findings provide useful insights into the policy makers in setting regulations in respect of board diversity in Malaysia and other emerging economies in the Asian region. Our evidence is also useful for listed companies in setting the criteria to identify directors who can support their strategic decisions. (c) 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Environmental degradation, scarcity of resources, and societal issues have been reshaping the strategic agendas and governance mechanisms of many organizations. From a traditional perspective, the duty of the board of directors (BOD) has always been to the owners and investors of the firm. With the beginning of the 21st century, a social paradigm has emerged, reflecting broader directors' responsibilities in not only fulfilling shareholders' interests but also addressing stakeholders' needs. Both research and practice emphasize a metamorphosis of the board's task, which is not restricted to maximizing shareholder's value but also involves going out into the real world and tackling the emerging concerns regarding social and ecological practices. Following the premises of stakeholder theory, this study examines the association between the determinants of the board of directors and sustainable performance. Based on the Dow Jones Sustainability (DJSI) and Standard and Poor's Global Broad Market Indices (S&P Global BMI), with a matching sample of 478 multinational companies, the results reveal a significant and positive relationship between sustainability and the board's size, gender diversity, average age of directors and number of committees. From a cross-national perspective, the study confirms the existence of dissimilarities in the characteristics of the boards of directors of European (EU) and non-European (non-EU) firms vis-a-vis sustainable performance. The practical implications of the study can be useful for policymakers and governance systems in identifying the nature of the "green" board. In light of the managerial inference, the study delivers an explicit recommendation on the composition of the board of directors and stakeholder management to promote sustainability adoption.

Purpose: This study aims to reconcile some of the conflicting results in prior studies of the board structure-firm performance relationship and to evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of agency theory in the specific context of Italian corporate governance practice. Design/methodology/approach: This research applies a dynamic generalised method of moments on a sample of Italian listed companies over the period 2003-2015. Proxies for corporate governance mechanisms are the board size, the level of board independence, ownership structure, shareholder agreements and CEO-chairman leadership. Findings: While directors elected by minority shareholders are not able to impact performance, independent directors do have a non-linear effect on performance. Board size has a positive effect on firm performance for lower levels of board size. Ownership structure per se and shareholder agreements do not affect firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This paper contributes to the literature on agency theory by reconciling some of the conflicting results inherent in the board structure-performance relationship. Firm performance is not necessarily improved by having a high number of independent directors on the board. Ownership structure and composition do not affect firm performance; therefore, greater monitoring provided by concentrated ownership does not necessarily lead to stronger firm performance. Practical implications: This paper suggests that Italian corporate governance law should improve the rules and effectiveness of minority directors by analysing whether they are able to impede the main shareholders to expropriate private benefits on the expenses of the minority. The legislator should not impose any restrictive regulations with regard to CEO duality, as the influence of CEO duality on performance may vary with respect to the unique characteristics of each company. Originality/value: The results enrich the understanding of the applicability of agency theory in listed companies, especially in Italy. Additionally, this paper provides a comprehensive synthesis of research evidence of agency theory studies. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The benefit of gender diversity on the board of directors is a subject of current debate. We contribute to the literature on diversity and its impact on businesses from an analytical framework that incorporates agency theory and the concept of socioemotional wealth (SEW). Our findings suggest that the inclusion of women on the board goes beyond ethical concerns being also relevant from a business perspective (i.e. increases risk-taking). The proportion of independent female directors on the board is shown to increase venturing risk (i.e. with the expectation of improving future performance), but does not interfere with performance hazard risk which conceptualizes the family desire to preserve SEW, especially in firms where these risks are low. By contrast, the proportion of non-independent female directors on the board increases significantly performance hazard risk, but only in family firms. In summary, we find with data from Latin America that the motivation for risk-taking differs depending on whether the appointment is as an independent female director, the type of risk and on whether the firm is controlled by a family.

Although increased board independence is a commonly offered solution to curbing corporate misconduct, scholars have expressed skepticism about its effectiveness, and empirical evidence is mixed. We argue that the relationship between board independence and corporate misconduct is likely nuanced--and may vary by the type of independence (e.g., independence on the whole board or on the audit committee) and by national context. We conducted a meta-analysis of 135 studies spanning more than 20 countries. We find that the board independence-corporate misconduct relationship (a) is generally negative, (b) varies based on the implementation form that independence takes on (i.e., independence of the whole board, on the audit committee, or between the roles of CEO and board chair), and (c) is more strongly negative in countries with less corruption. We advance corporate governance theory and research by demonstrating that the popular governance practice of increasing board independence must both account for the manner in which independence is implemented and consider the powerful influence of firms' broader societal context to clearly understand its effect. Further, based on our review of the literature, we uncover opportunities for the advancement of corporate governance and corporate misconduct research. (c) The Author(s) 2018.

Going beyond the mere participation of female directors within boardrooms, we investigate which of the two major boards of directors' roles (advisory versus monitoring) is best played by female directors in order to make a difference to shareholders. More specifically, we investigate the impact that advisory and monitoring female directors have on managerial opportunism with a specific focus on earnings management. Using sample of US firms, we find evidence suggesting that female directors holding monitoring roles mitigate managerial opportunism, as measured by discretionary accruals. In contrast to the current argument that advisory directors in general are better able to sustain and improve earnings quality, we find no evidence that suggests that advisory female directors are significantly associated with lower managerial opportunism. Overall, the results remain robust after controlling for potential endogeneity problems, corporate governance, and external auditor quality. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This study aims to analyze the efficiency of banks under board gender diversity and to examine the determinants of bank efficiency. Design/methodology/approach: Data for analysis were sourced from annual reports of 21 banks for the period from 2009 to 2017. A two-step framework was used: first, an examination of efficiency scores with and without board gender diversity computed using data envelopment analysis; and second, a regression of board gender diversity as a determinant of bank efficiency using panel estimation on an unbalanced panel data. Findings: The results reveal that gender diversity promotes bank efficiency up to a maximum of two female directors on a nine-member board of directors, suggesting a threshold effect on bank efficiency. Board size improves bank efficiency. Board independence is negatively related to bank efficiency. Also, powerful chief executive officers are detrimental for bank efficiency. Finally, the authors find that ownership structure, bank size, bank age and loan-to-deposit ratio are important factors affecting bank efficiency. Research limitations/implications: All bank-year observations with no female representation on the board were excluded. As such, this paper is limited to 21 banks. Future research should look at a larger data set and account for dynamic endogeneity. Practical implications: The paper contributes to bank governance structure, namely, gender composition of boards, and provides an insight for regulators and shareholders to estimate the role of men and women on boards. Originality/value: The novel feature of the efficiency model used is that it incorporates board gender diversity as an additional input variable, in line with the preposition of proponent of resource dependency theory.

Research Summary: This study explores how external pressure for board gender diversity influences the increase of female directors. We propose that while external pressure has a positive effect on the increase of female directors on boards, it heightens the salience of gender in new director selection, making incumbent male directors more likely to treat the new female directors as outgroup members and consequently more likely to add them through addition of board seats rather than substitution of male directors. We further predict that new female directors added through additional board seats are less likely to serve on major board committees than those added through substitution of male directors. Results from a large sample of S&P 1,500 firms during 2004 to 2015 provide support our theoretical predictions. Managerial Summary: Our study intends to enhance the understanding of how external pressure influences a firm's decision to increase the number of female directors on the board. We find that, although external pressure makes firms more likely to increase female directors, firms tend to do it through the addition of board seats rather than through the replacement of incumbent male directors to the extent that the increase is a response to the external pressure. Moreover, we find that new female directors added through addition of board seats are less likely to serve on major board committees than those added through replacement of male directors. These findings suggest that external pressure has a positive but limited effect on countering the gender bias on corporate boards toward female directors. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper examines the demand- and supply-side factors associated with audit partner selection and assignment in the United States. First, we examine whether audit partner gender and experience are associated with board and management gender and experience. Second, we investigate whether engagement audit quality varies with audit partner gender and experience, controlling for selection effects. The results indicate that companies with more gender-diverse boards of directors and top management teams are more likely to have a female lead audit partner. In addition, the experience of the client's board is positively associated with the experience of the lead audit partner. In terms of audit quality, we find that higher audit fees are positively associated with female and more experienced audit partners. Our results shed light on the important role that partner characteristics play in the demand and supply sides of audit quality. (c) 2019 American Accounting Association. All rights reserved.

Research Summary: We employ an exploratory approach to understand what differentiates boards that retain limited, potentially tokenistic, gender diversity (i.e., a single female director), and boards that more genuinely diversify their composition by appointing additional female directors. Previous studies have speculated that strategic leaders responsible for board appointments may influence this occurrence. Using longitudinal data on U.S. firms, we find that more female top managers and having the sole female director serve on the nominating committee increase the likelihood of additional female director appointments. Boards and nominating committees with younger members amplify these effects, respectively. We use interviews with board members and professional corporate governance consultants to discuss the probable causal mechanisms that underpin these relationships, highlighting novel theoretical insights related to gatekeeping and social psychology. Managerial Summary: We explore what compels firms to appoint additional female directors after the first one, as only one female director could be considered a token. Using data on U.S. firms, we find that more female top managers and having the sole female director serve on the nominating committee make firms more likely to appoint additional female directors. These likelihoods are highest when younger directors make up the board at large and/or nominating committee. Chief executive officers can be change agents for gender diversity in their organizations by hiring female top managers and pushing for better representation of women on boards. Likewise, younger directors appear to enhance board gender diversity. These findings can inform the director selection process. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper examines the relationship between boards of directors' demographic diversity and firms' financial performance. In particular, we highlight how women and ethnic minorities can affect Middle Eastern SMEs' financial performance. Using an unbalanced panel of 1,855 firm-year observations of 371 boards of directors from nine Middle Eastern countries, our results support the positive impact of women and ethnic minority group members on Middle Eastern firms' performance. However, our evidence implies that when Western ethnic minority members increase, firms' performances tend to decrease, because these board members are appointed for regional and international board reputation legitimacy, personal business agendas, and links to the external corporate environment.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to verify the influence of the characteristics of boards of directors on the level of environmental disclosure by Brazilian companies. The board is one of the main mechanisms of corporate governance and its characteristics can influence the level of environmental disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a sample of 152 companies listed on the Sao Paulo stock exchange, the BM&FBovespa. The level of environmental information was obtained by conducting a content analysis of company sustainability reports and websites. The generalized additive models based on negative binomial distribution were used to verify the influence of the characteristics of boards on environmental disclosure. Findings: The results indicate that the number of independent board members had statistical significance, suggesting that board independence can improve the control of the administration and encourage greater environmental disclosure. The age variables showed that environmental disclosure increased on boards with average age up to 60 and then decreased. Originality/value: It is expected that this study will contribute to the literature on corporate governance promotion by producing empiric data about the impacts of the characteristics of boards of directors on the level of environmental disclosure of companies that operate in a country with an emerging economy, Brazil. Another contribution may be related to the process of choosing board members because a board of directors must be composed of members with various characteristics to reduce the asymmetry of information and improve a company's environmental disclosure policies.

Purpose: This paper aims to use the passage of the Italian Gender Diversity Law to help isolate the effects of board gender diversity on firm value by investigating conditions under which such diversity provides greater role-enhancing resources to the board. Design/methodology/approach: This paper used a one-day event study to measure when gender diversity matters to investors. Abnormal returns from Italian firms were used to study investors' anticipated outcomes of the effect of gender diversity on firm value. Findings: Board gender diversity is financially beneficial especially for firms with a male dual CEO and board chair and with few or no women on board committees and firms that operate in industries with greater levels of competition. Addition of these moderators more than doubles the variance explained. Moreover, the effect of gender is isolated in this study, which examined investor reaction to the expectation of increases in the number of female board members, rather than to specific female appointees. Social implications: Determining the conditions when a gender diverse matters to firm value is important for shareholders, policymakers and advocates for gender equality. The findings illustrate precise conditions for stakeholders to make the case for board gender diversity as achieving financial reward, in addition to societal benefit. Originality/value: The value of a gender diverse board is contingent on the company's need for diverse resources (e.g. more competition, lack of gender diversity on committees or CEO duality). This paper provides insight as to why prior research linking board gender diversity to firm value finds seemingly contradictory results. Thus, this paper provides useful insights for researchers, boards and legislative bodies. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The authors hypothesize that customer presence in the boardroom of business-to-business (B2B) firms brings customer orientation and customer knowledge to the board of directors and thereby enhances B2B firm performance. Using an objective measure of customer presence in the boardroom and a sample of 329 B2B firms over a nine-year period, the authors find support for this hypothesis. Moreover, relying on the resource-based view, they hypothesize that the performance benefit of customers in the boardroom is contingent on the value, rarity, inimitability, and organizational fit of customer resources. Specifically, they find that a customer on the board is more effective when demand uncertainty is high but is less effective when the firm is highly diversified. Moreover, a board member who is an independent director of the customer firm is less effective than a board member who is an executive at the customer firm. The authors also find that research and development intensity partially mediates the relationship between customer presence on the board and firm performance. (c) American Marketing Association 2018.

This study examines the impact of corporate tax avoidance on board of directors and chief executive officer (CEO) reputation. Our regression results show that when firms engage in tax avoidance, both directors and CEOs, on average, are rewarded by improvements in their reputations as proxied by an increased number of outside board seats. In particular, both independent directors and non-CEO executive directors undergo positive changes in reputation. We also find that CEOs of tax-aggressive firms experience enhanced reputations by gaining extra board seats. Our main regression results hold based on additional analyses. Overall, this study provides important empirical evidence confirming an association between tax avoidance and the individual reputations of directors and CEOs. (c) 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

Research Summary: A number of studies examine the extent to which boards compensate CEOs for their firm's performance (i.e., pay-for-performance), but these studies typically do not incorporate what CEOs actually do to bring about those performance outcomes. We suggest that directors will make stronger internal attributions about firm performance when the CEO engages in high levels of corporate strategic investment. CEOs that invest in firm growth essentially "place their bets," so the pay-for-performance relationship is stronger for them than it is for CEOs who do not invest as much in firm growth. We also theorize and find that directors make internal attributions about firm performance more for prestigious, but not less prestigious, CEOs and more when the directors collectively exhibit conservative, but not liberal, political ideologies. Managerial Summary: Shareholders and other stakeholders often demand that CEOs should be paid for performance. In other words, CEOs should be paid well when the company is performing well and paid less when the company is not performing well. We add an additional dimension: boards might also consider what CEOs actually do to bring about performance outcomes. Our findings suggest that when CEOs make heavy corporate investments, they essentially "place their bets." In this scenario, boards attribute performance to the CEO so that CEO compensation rises and falls with company performance. When CEOs make fewer corporate investments, their compensation is not as strongly associated with company performance. This primary relationship is particularly true when CEOs have high social recognition or when the directors are collectively conservative. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purpose: Boards of directors of large companies all over the world frequently have a certain number of shared directors, which can be motivated by social structures that foster different types of links, including investments and vertical relationships. The purpose of this paper is to identify the effects that board interlocking exerts on innovation, considering the different nature of shared directors that finally determines the type of links dominating the boards. Design/methodology/approach: Panel regression analyses were conducted using data collected from 69 Spanish listed innovative sector companies during the period 2010-2014, which provided an unbalanced panel of 325 data observations. Findings: The results suggested that the typology of interlocks determined their effects on innovation, which had a positive influence when independent and extra-industry directors held multiple directorships, whereas it was negative in the case of intra-industry and women interlocking directors. Practical implications: This study provided evidence for the diverse effects of interlocking directorates and contributed to the open debate on the best board composition for improving business innovation, considering the common feature of shared directorships. Originality/value: The value of this research was twofold. On the one hand, the study considered a wide typology of interlocking directorates, such as women, affiliated and independent directors, intra- and extra-industry directorships, as well as shared directors from the same country. On the other hand, the effects of these different interlocking directorate typologies were analysed on innovation by considering different innovation indicators. (c) 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to use the dynamic capabilities framework to explain the effect of board networks, as a source of intellectual capital, on firm performance. The authors propose that the influence of board interlocks depends on their ability to contribute to strategic decision making. As a result, their effect is subject to the business context in which they occur and the different role of the interconnected directors involved. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use social network analysis to make board connections and to calculate centrality measures. The authors also identify busy boards to analyze whether their effect differs from centrality. The authors estimate the theoretical model using the Generalized Method of Moments in order to take advantage of the panel database. Findings: For a sample of Spanish firms from 1999 to 2015, the results show there is no direct significant effect of directors' networks on firm performance. However, the authors find a positive and significant influence of intra-industry board connections, particularly when they are established among outsiders. Research limitations/implications: The Spanish context of the study can limit the generalization of the papers' results. Practical implications: The results can be useful both for practitioners - since they can serve as a guide for companies to reformulate their boards in search of the optimal structure-, and when implementing good governance codes - establishing limits for director interlocking. Originality/value: This study helps to offer a better understanding of how directors' networks can add value to the firm depending on the kind of resources they provide (context) and the role of the director who is connected.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to use insights from role congruity theory to explore how organizational context moderates the relationship between the representation of women on boards and corporate social performance (CSP). Design/methodology/approach: The hypotheses are tested using a panel of S&P 500 firms observed from 2001 to 2011. The authors utilize the generalized estimating equations technique with Heckman's two-stage approach to correct for endogeneity. Findings: The findings reveal that four firm-level variables - voluntary initiative membership, deviation from prior financial performance, internationalization and product diversification - moderate the relationship between the representation of women on boards and CSP. These findings suggest that women directors have the ability to prioritize and advocate for social issues in the boardroom to a greater extent when firms provide a context that values their communal orientation. In contrast, the relationship between women directors and CSP weakens when the context encourages a focus on the bottom line. Originality/value: This study reconciles mixed findings from previous research and contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between women directors and social performance by providing a theory-driven perspective of the circumstances under which women directors have a stronger or weaker impact on CSP. The authors extend role congruity theory by integrating contextual factors that may either diminish or amplify the effects of the expected directors' gender roles on their behavior and decision making.

Although personal attributes have gained recognition as an important area of effective corporate governance, scholarship has largely overlooked the value and implications of individual virtue in governance practice. We explore how authenticity--a personal and morally significant virtue--affects the primary monitoring and strategy functions of the board of directors as well as core processes concerning director selection, cultivation, and enactment by the board. While the predominant focus in corporate governance research has been on structural factors that influence firm financial outcomes, this paper shifts attention to the role of authenticity and its relationship to individual board member qualities and collective board activities. We explore how authenticity has the potential to influence board dynamics and decision making and to enhance transparency and accountability.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of the size and the roles of the board of directors (BD) on two types of innovation namely exploitative and exploratory innovations. These relationships have been little explored in the literature, particularly in developing economies. Using a quantitative approach, an empirical study was conducted on a sample of 51 Tunisian listed companies. It revealed that exploratory innovation is promoted by BDs service role. The results also highlight that exploitative innovation is positively related to the BD's strategy role but negatively associated with BD's control role. The findings do not show a significant effect of BD's size on the two types of innovation. This research provides insights to companies looking to improve their corporate governance practices and develop a sustainable competitive advantage based on innovation.

Purpose: This paper aims to analyze the influence of gender diversity on the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR), corporate governance (CG) and economic and financial performance of Brazilian publicly traded companies. Design/methodology/approach: The sample comprises 68 non-financial public companies comprising the IBX100 index of BM&FBOVESPA. For that, it was used panel data modeling, correlation and ranking by TOPSIS method. Findings: The results suggest a significant relationship between CG and economic-financial performance when mediated by gender diversity. This relationship was not observed between CSR and economic-financial performance. Thus, it can be concluded that in a diversified board of directors, in terms of gender, better monitoring of managers can occur because of the increase in their independence in decisions, as well as performance increase. These results diverge from the literature on the influence of women's participation in corporate boards in CSR. It is assumed that this result is because of the fact that the participation of women is recent in Brazil. Research limitations/implications: The main limitations are the number of companies analyzed, the choice of ISE index to verify the CSR variable and the metric used to verify the CG mechanisms. Originality/value: In general, this research contributes to the literature of the area, especially in Brazil, in confirming that the mediating variable gender diversity makes the relationship between CG and performance more significant.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the differences in men and women, such as risk aversion in decision making, can influence the amount of capital that the board of directors can allocate for investment opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: This study sampled 212 IPOs over the period of 2005-2015 and employed the OLS and the quantile regression techniques to examine the impact of female directors on capital allocation. Findings: The results show that women on corporate boards have a positive influence on the amount of capital an IPO company can allocate for investment opportunities. These findings suggest that the investment strategies of women in an emerging financial market, like Malaysia, may differ from women in other financial markets. Practical implications: The presence of women on corporate boards plays an important role in board involvement in a company's strategic decision at the time of the IPO. Therefore, regulators and IPO issuers should pay close attention to the corporate governance structure of a company at the time of an IPO. In addition, investors and other stakeholders of a company may consider women on corporate boards as an important factor in financing and investment decisions. Originality/value: Despite several studies that have examined the influence of women on corporate boards on corporate outcomes, globally, the presence of women on corporate boards and their influence on corporate decision-making related to allocation of capital to investment opportunities, have not been fully explored in the IPO literature.

This study aims to investigate the influence of board diversity on the performance of firm's corporate social responsibility (CSR) in France, by using five different measures of CSR across 89 Frenchcompanies from 2012 to 2015. The findings revealed that board diversity measured by gender is positively related to (SCR) performance. Moreover, after controlling CEO age and board characteristics, this study finds supporting evidence for a positive association between board diversity and CSR. The findings of the study emphasize the mass theory and are consistent with the argument that board diversity boosts firms' ability to satisfy the need of their stakeholders. The findings also confirm that board diversity is necessary to improve corporate governance. Our results remain robust using different measures of board diversity and methods of analysis.

The awareness of board of directors' role in enhancing firms' financial performance has increased noticeably over the last years. Previous studies, however, have covered a traditional set of characteristics (i.e. board independence, board size and board meetings), but few studies are conducted to explore the impact of a new set of characteristics (i.e. political connections, number of foreign members and busy directors) on banks' performance within the context of emerging markets. This study was motivated to combine the new set of characteristics with the traditional ones to gauge the impact of them on financial performance. Employing an Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression technique on a sample of 14 Jordanian banks listed at the Amman Stock Exchange between 2013 and 2017 revealed that the only variable that has a significant positive impact on financial performance is board size. Busy directors have not obtained the sufficient knowledge and experience or at least they lacked the required time to enhance performance. Politically connected directors as well as foreign members were a stumbling block in the way to positively improve performance. Board meetings and independence were found to be insignificantly associated with return on assets. In a nutshell, the Jordanian regulators need to devote more efforts to revise the suggested characteristics related to boards of directors; since the current composition of boards has been presented as a weak monitoring tool to fulfil principals' goals through enhancing banks' performance.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate what board characteristics affect companies in periods of financial distress (FD) among non-financial Brazilian firms and examine which model best fits to predict FD. Design/methodology/approach: The sample comprises data from 2010 to 2016 of the non-financial Brazilian firms listed on the Brazilian Stock Exchange. To measure this relationship, a conditional logistic regression is performed. Findings: A U-shaped relationship between the size of the board of directors (BD) and FD is found in all models, indicating an optimal number of six members in the BD during the period of FD. However, board characteristics (related to composition and directors' independence) are insufficient to align the shareholders' interests and unsuitable for avoiding or even reducing FD in firms when other factors are neglected. Furthermore, the results reveal what variables provide the best-fitting models to predict FD. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that investigates how the composition of the BD affects the FD likelihood in the Brazilian context. The findings are potentially of interest to researchers and practitioners since this paper contributes to the growing literature on the influence of corporate governance mechanisms in periods of FD and the understanding of its prediction models.

Drawing on the identity fit perspective in organizational identity research, we investigate changes in new director selection patterns for family-influenced (i.e., family identity) and lone founder (i.e., entrepreneurial identity) firms experiencing growth. We collect over 7000 observations of new director placements from 2001 to 2014 and find that both family-influenced and lone founder firms tend to decrease the selection of new directors with similar firm-type board experience as firm size grows and firm performance deviates from that of similar firms. Lone founder firms also decrease the extent to which they hire new directors with previous board experience in lone founder firms following the appointment of a nonfounder CEO. We conclude that while family-influenced firms often use new director selection decisions to maintain the fit between family and firm identity, firm growth creates challenging conditions that threaten family-firm identity maintenance.

Given the vital importance of the board of directors, firms seek to staff their boards with competent individuals who bring valuable skills and expertise to assist a firm. Especially following crises, firms should be interested in appointing directors who possess not only superior decision-making skills under pressure, but who also may be inclined to behave more ethically to prevent future breaches of stakeholder trust. Applying a social identity perspective, we argue that directors with U.S. military experience are decidedly valuable to firms because of their human capital. Using a sample of 144 U.S. based, publicly-traded firms that experienced a Securities Class Action Lawsuit between 2002 and 2012, we test hypotheses predicting that following crises, firms are more likely to appoint directors with military experience. Our findings extend the social identity view of an individual from the self or how individuals view themselves to include how others may view them.

Purpose: This paper aims to draw on insights from team learning theory and stakeholder theory to examine the influence of board composition on firms' stakeholder management practices. The authors posit that board diversity is likely to enhance stakeholder management by shaping organizational goals by placing emphasis on the interests of a wide variety of stakeholders and providing firms with relevant knowledge to enhance their ability manage these interests. The authors further theorize on the moderating role of boards' learning environment, which they conceptualized as an important complementary governance-related factor, likely to further boards' ability to enhance stakeholder management. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test these predictions using the generalized estimating equations (GEE) technique on a panel of S&P 500 firms observed from 2001 to 2011. Findings: The findings provide evidence that more diverse boards in terms of gender, nationality and race/ethnicity are generally associated with more effective stakeholder management. Further, the findings also suggest that boards' co-working experience moderates the relationship between gender and national diversity and stakeholder management. Originality/value: While corporate governance research surveys many strategic implications of board composition, limited attention has been paid to the interplay of board characteristics with stakeholder management. This study is among the first to the authors' knowledge to explore the impact of board diversity on stakeholder management using team learning research, thus drawing attention to the role of boards' co-working experience in shaping their ability to impact firms' outcomes.

Purpose: How do business groups manage their internal processes? The purpose of this paper is to explore how board interlocks between members serve as control and coordination mechanisms within business groups. The authors propose that centrality of groups' affiliates in the group network of interlocking directorates is shaped by agency and resource dependence forces. In particular, the authors examine the role of international board ties as a resource and information conduit. Design/methodology/approach: This study leverages proprietary information on firm-to-firm transaction ties among all 155 affiliates belonging to a large Italian business group. The authors use network analysis to develop multiple measures of the centrality of each group member, and link these to resource transactions, ownership patterns and geographic distributions. The authors test the hypotheses in a structural equation model using LISREL. Findings: The results demonstrate that both resource exchanges and the presence of cross-national relations increase an affiliate's central position in the group's network of board ties. In contrast, ownership ties between members were unrelated to affiliate centrality. Originality/value: Internal governance mechanisms of business groups are rarely studied. While groups are often portrayed as inefficient or value-destroying, the analysis of proprietary firm data suggests a very different scenario: inter-unit ties are much more supportive of a model of business groups as strategic portfolios, using internal ties to share information and resources.

Considerable advances have been made in corporate governance research in recent years and opportunities exist to consider these developments within alliances. We extend the "scope of operations" hypothesis to the domain of joint ventures. This proposition suggests that the monitoring carried out by boards increases when organizations become more complex. The inherent characteristics of JVs generate unique sources of complexity that are currently unexplored in the corporate governance literature. First, we seek to determine their influence on monitoring by using primary data on JV board monitoring. Second, we adopt the size of JV boards as a proxy for monitoring in order to examine whether the determinants of board size and monitoring in fact coincide and to reveal if certain effects are masked by using board size as a simple proxy for monitoring. Doing so enables us to investigate the black-box of what boards actually do as well as extend governance research to other organizational forms. Our findings confirm that the unique characteristics of JVs influence the information needs by the boards resulting in more monitoring by JV directors. Our findings show there is value in bridging alliance theory and the literature on corporate governance research. We also advance practitioner's understanding by providing suggestions on how to structure JV boards in relation to their complexity. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd

We study minority equity partnerships and the representation of investing firms on the boards of directors of their partners. In such alliances, an investor firm owns a minority position in the investee partner and may or may not secure a board seat. Prior alliance governance research has largely focused on the choice between equity and nonequity forms of alliances, and it has paid little attention to the particular administrative features of these organizational forms, notably their governing boards. We extend corporate governance research that has emphasized the monitoring and advisory roles of boards by examining how an investee's concerns about knowledge misappropriation can reduce the likelihood that an investor obtains board representation. We suggest that, although there exist opportunities for an investee to benefit from the investor's advice, the investor's ability to use an investee's knowledge by itself and indirectly with the help of its other partners negatively affects the likelihood of a board seat for the investor. We further argue that this negative effect is amplified when the investee has particularly valuable technologies at risk of appropriation by the investor. Our evidence from minority equity partnerships in the biopharmaceutical industry indicates why and when investors do not obtain board seats, despite the monitoring and advisory benefits that directors can bring to cooperative commercialization agreements.

Corporate governance of banks is important and unique (Levine, 2004). Sound bank corporate governance is a crucial element for promoting a more resilient financial system (FSB, 2013) and sustaining economic growth (BCBS, 2015). A systematic literature review is conducted on the articles published in peer-reviewed academic journals to identify the prevailing results in academic research on bank board characteristics, which is the most investigated topic in bank corporate governance. Based on both theoretical and empirical contributions, findings show that research mainly measures the impact of board characteristics on performance and risks potentially faced by banks, however there is no univocal consensus on the best practices to adopt. Further research is needed to directly investigate other areas of bank corporate governance (such as internal risk management, remuneration and ownership structure).

The entrepreneurial attitude of companies is key to compete in a globalized and dynamic economic environment. Thus, it is of special interest the analysis of the factors that promote or hinder the entrepreneurial orientation (EO) of organizations. In the case of family businesses, the interaction between the family and the business can directly affect the OE, although this effect may vary depending on whether it occurs in the top management team or in the Board of Directors. In addition, the effect of family involvement in both organs may be affected by their respective sizes. Based on a sample of 91 family SMEs, this paper shows the negative effect on OE of a high proportion of family members in the Board and in the top management team, an effect that is reinforced when the number of decision-makers in each organ is greater. This study also finds that the involvement of different family generations in the top management team has a positive effect on EO, decreasing this influence in larger top management teams In addition to the theoretical implications of these findings, the practical implications for managers and owners of family SMEs that are immersed in a period of professionalization are especially interesting. Thus, this study can be helpful in designing the size and the composition of the top management team and the Board of Directors of this type of organization. (c) 2019, Cuadernos de Gestion.
La actitud emprendedora de las empresas es clave para competir en un entorno economico globalizado y dinamico. Por ello, resulta de especial interes el analisis de los factores que promueven o dificultan la orientacion emprendedora (OE) de las organizaciones. En el caso de las empresas familiares, la interaccion entre la familia y la empresa puede afectar directamente a la OE, si bien ese efecto puede variar dependiendo de si se produce en el equipo directivo o en el Consejo de Administracion. Ademas, el efecto de la implicacion familiar en ambos organos puede verse afectada por sus respectivos tamanos. Basandonos en una muestra de 91 pymes familiares, este trabajo demuestra el efecto negativo que sobre la OE tienen una alta proporcion de familiares en el Consejo y en el equipo directivo, efecto que se ve acentuado cuando el numero de decisores en cada organo es mayor. Por su parte, este estudio tambien constata que la involucracion de diferentes generaciones familiares en el equipo directivo tiene un efecto positivo sobre la OE, disminuyendo esta influencia en los equipos directivos mas grandes. Ademas de las implicaciones teoricas que de estos hallazgos se derivan, son especialmente interesantes las implicaciones practicas para los gestores y duenos de las pymes familiares que se encuentran inmersas en un periodo de profesionalizacion. Asi, este estudio puede ser de ayuda a la hora de disenar el tamano y la composicion del equipo directivo y del Consejo de Administracion de este tipo de organizaciones.

By expanding understanding of individuals' reasons to serve on nonprofit boards, practitioners will be able to improve recruitment and retention of quality board members. This study explores board members' reasons for joining and continuing to serve on a volunteer nonprofit board of directors. A survey of nonprofit board members shows similarities in reasons for initially serving and continuing to serve on a board, but analysis of group means reveals significant differences on 20 of 27 dimensions examined. Organizational-level reasons are reported as more important as a result of board service, whereas individual- and community-level items decline in importance after board service. Latent factors that appear to be important for both joining and continuing to serve on a nonprofit board include organizational commitment, personal growth, recognition, and socialness.

We argue that the analysis of multiple political connections in an event study framework can improve the study of institutional change. Based on a unique data set of multiple political relationships of 4,936 South Korean board of director members, we show that the large business conglomerates, the chaebol, did not benefit from the unexpected conservative election victories in the 2012 South Korean parliamentary and presidential elections. Personal connections to the presidential candidates and to the opposition party were relevant for the stock returns of small firms. Our findings suggest that Korea's political economy has evolved into a hybrid regime in which the political power of large multinational corporations is limited, but political connections still matter for smaller firms. The corruption scandal that led to the impeachment of President Park in 2017 and the long-term development of market capitalisation appear to be congruent with the results of our study.

The present research article is an attempt to add something new and revalidate the influence of already existing corporate governance dimensions related to the board of directors on listing-day performance of the Indian initial public offering (IPO) firms measured through underpricing. Like other emerging market economies, firms in the Indian economy are also characterized by concentrated ownership held by an owner or a promoter in the context of the Indian corporate environment. In the backdrop of this concentrated complex ownership structure, the present study analyses the influence of the board of directors on underpricing when the appointment of such directors is largely an affair handled by such owners, whom they are given the task to monitor. The sample consists of 471 IPO firms which went public during the time period from January 2003 to December 2017. Results obtained from the regression analysis show that the board size and board committees act as information signals for Indian IPO firms having a significant and negative relation with listing-day initial excess returns. Other board-related dimensions of governance do not have significant influence on underpricing. Overall board variables have a very miniscule contribution in explaining the underpricing in Indian IPO firms. (c) 2019 XLRI Jamshedpur, School of Business Management & Human Resources.

The objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between directors' remuneration and firm performance among state-owned enterprise (SOE) in Malaysia. In addition, we examine whether board size and government's role moderate the relationship between directors' remuneration and firm performance in SOE. Using panel data regression model on 118 firm-year observations of state-owned enterprise in Malaysia from 2011 to 2013, this study finds there is positive relationship between directors' remuneration and firm performance. The result provides supports that directors' remuneration acts as incentive to board of directors to perform their monitoring task. The result also indicates that larger board size and government play an important role in enhancing firm performance of state-owned enterprise in Malaysia. Nevertheless, when we interact both variables with directors' remuneration, the result indicates that larger board size and political connected directors moderate the positive relationship between firm performance and directors' remuneration. Our result provides evidence that the interaction between directors' remuneration and board size as well as political connected directors explain firm performance among state owned enterprise in Malaysia.

This study considers the effect of foreign board members and age diversity on real earnings management (REM), by controlling the firm size, leverage and growth. This study employed quantitative methodology and longitudinal data for non-financial business firms, quoted on the Amman Stock Exchange from 2011 to 2015. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and Panel Corrected Standard Errors (PCSE) regression. This study found that foreign boards member, age diversity, leverage and growth had negative and significant associations with REM. Based on the results, a firm should appoint young members to the board in addition to older members to pave the way to cross-ideology that can deter REM activities. At least one foreign director should exist within the board of directors because a foreign board member has different qualifications and experiences that may help to deter REM practices.

Despite high female participation in the Thai labour market, female representation on Thai boards of directors is low. This study investigates the effect of female representation on boards of directors on the level of corporate governance in Thailand. The ordered logit regression is applied to a dataset of companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). The main results show that an improvement in corporate governance is associated with a higher ratio of women appointed as board directors. Furthermore, female leadership in the form of chairpersons on executive and audit committees, two important subcommittees, strongly and positively affects corporate governance levels. Finally, the presence of women on a board has a similar effect on corporate governance as that of the presence of independent directors does. The findings offer an insightful introduction to policy makers for promoting female leadership roles on boards to enhance corporate governance. Copyright (c) 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This study confirms that a firm's size in the previous year significantly increases board of director compensation in the current year, while the number of directors and the firm's capital expenditure significantly decrease it. On average, 31.2% of restaurant firms overcompensate their board of directors, while 33.8% pay less than the expected amount of compensation to their board of directors. However, contrary to public concern, this study argues that the amounts of over- and under-compensation are negligible in proportion to the directors' total compensation, and thus the issue of over- and under-compensation may not pose a serious problem in the restaurant industry. In particular, the amount of overcompensation has a positive effect on firm growth and capital investment, but does not substantially decrease firms' operational and financial performance. The amount of overcompensation can even have a positive influence on financial performance, although the effect is not statistically significant. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Risk in financial institutions is vitally important to regulators, policy makers, investors, and the stability of the financial system, yet some critical aspects of that risk remain poorly understood. In the case of U.S. startup banks, a critical choice that can influence risk-taking behavior is which of three regulators--with varying levels of stringency--to choose. The board of directors of the new bank makes this important decision, which may result in different risk implications, depending on board's structure. Here, we examine banks' risk behavior associated with the degree of board independence and the choice of regulator. We find that the regulatory environment and board independence jointly influence new bank risk. Our evidence suggests that the intensity of regulatory scrutiny is a partial substitute for board independence in achieving an optimal level of risk. We discuss the implications of our findings for theory and policy. (c) 2018, Springer Nature Limited.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework to examine the relationship among the board of directors' characteristics, internal control mechanisms, and corporate sustainability performance. In particular, it aims to uncover how the board specific characteristics influence internal control, which, ultimately, would enhance the sustainability performance of public listed companies. The premise of the resource dependence theory is utilised to identify the board characteristics that may influence the sustainability performance; namely, size, composition, leadership, ownership, diversity, and expertise. Inspired by the institutional theory, the mediating role of internal control mechanisms, proxied by enterprise risk management (ERM) and management control systems (MCS) is also examined in this relationship. The majority of the previous studies concentrated on a few particular dimensions of sustainability like environmental and social aspects, whereas the governance and economic aspects remain unexplored in the literature. This paper fills this important research gap through holistically conceptualising sustainability performance. (c) 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The emerging markets undergo constant transformations and changes, and thus, a change of strategy can be critical for companies. However, the impact of R&D investment on firm performance and the role of the board of directors that makes decisions about a company's innovative activities remain inconclusive. This paper investigates the relationship between a board of directors' composition and structure in innovative companies and firm performance. Using the panel data of innovative Russian public companies that made R&D investments in 2011-2013, we found a positive relationship between the boards' independence and ROA as an indicator of firm performance. Moreover, it was shown that innovative companies that establish a strategy committee will on average have a higher ROA ratio than innovative companies without such a committee. Innovative firms in emerging markets might consider creating strategic committees and increasing board independence to enhance their performance and increase the number of successful R&D investments.

Extending the proposition that boards of directors influence firms' mergers and acquisitions (M&As), studies have investigated how board interlocks - network ties formed by directors -- may shape M&A processes and outcomes. While board interlocks and M&As are two streams of research, each underpinned by voluminous studies, their cross-fertilization has been relatively limited. In this chapter, the authors take stock of prior research investigating the relationship between board interlocks and M&As. Specifically, emphasizing the network features of board interlocks, the authors highlight a connection aspect and a structure aspect of board interlocks in appreciating their effects during pre-acquisition and post-acquisition phases. Based on this framework, the authors then lay out a research agenda that can further bridge board interlocks with M&As. Overall, this chapter endeavors to integrate and expand our knowledge on the acquisition implications of board interlocks. (c) 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper explores the heterogeneity of board of directors and shareholders involvement in the audit committee in addressing the question of whether the board of directors and audit committee shareholders are effective in suppressing earnings management after the implementation of 2011 revised Code of Corporate Governance in Nigeria. The paper utilized data generated after the implementation of the new Code. It examines explicitly board effectiveness and audit committee shareholder chairman on earnings management in Nigerian financial institutions. The study utilizes a dynamic panel data model of the generalized method of moment (GMM) in analyzing the data. The empirical results suggest that board independence and shareholders as audit committee chair play an essential and a significant negative relationship in curving earnings management. Specifically, the results show that shareholders played effective roles in chairing the audit committee and suppressing the magnitude of earnings management. The results affirmed that the Big 4 relates to lower earnings management. Regulators should consider increasing the number of years shareholders representatives are to serve in the audit committee to continuously improve the quality of the financial reporting process and suppress managers' opportunistic behavior.

Building on research within corporate governance and strategic management, this paper explores how managerial discretion stemming from managerial task environment influences the balance between controlling and enabling managerial decision-making. Two sets of alternative hypotheses about the moderating effects of managerial discretion on the performance effects of board monitoring and CEO human capital were formulated. The results indicate partial support for governance-driven explanation showing that the association between board monitoring and market-based performance is strongest in environments characterized by high levels of managerial discretion. The findings also show that CEO human capital is positively associated with market-based performance in low-discretion environments, while in high-discretion environments this relationship turns negative. The central contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that managerial discretion is a useful tool to explain the balance between controlling and enabling managerial decision making.

Corporate governance of entrepreneurial firms comprises mechanisms through which directors, shareholders, entrepreneurs, and top management teams are involved with start-ups. On the basis of a literature review, we identify three interrelated themes frequently discussed by previous empirical studies: (1) the role of key stakeholders (e.g. directors, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs), (2) governance process (e.g. social networking and strategic decision making), and (3) outcomes of corporate governance (innovation, growth, and internationalization). We augment previous studies' investigations of various stakeholders' roles in corporate governance, by examining the relationships and interactions among various stakeholders or groups of stakeholders, especially between boards and top management teams. We conclude by proposing how future research can explore the effect of interactions between board of directors and top management teams on organizational outcomes. (c) David B. Audretsch, Erik E.

Purpose: New Zealand reintroduced titular honours (i.e. knighthoods and damehoods) in 2009. We document the prevalence of knights and dames on the board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: We use a probit regression to investigate what firm characteristics are significantly associated with having a knight or dame on the board of directors. Findings: We find 19 of 112 companies have a knight or dame on the board. These companies are bigger and have larger and more independent boards than other companies. We also find a knight or dame is more likely to serve in companies that have higher dividend yields. Research limitations/implications: The generalisability of our results is limited by the small number of knights and dames on the boards of listed companies and our archival regression approach. Although we document an association, we cannot prove causation. Originality/value: We show that directors with greater and easily visible reputational capital are more likely to supply their services to companies that mitigate risks to their reputation and protect minority shareholder interests.

The Malaysian government has encouraged the corporate sector to be seriously committed in supporting sustainable development. One of the elements in sustainable development is the inclusiveness of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the corporate sector. FDI plays an important role in the economy as it generates an economic growth by increasing the domestic capital formation and hence, promoting sustainability. This study examines the relationship of corporate governance characteristics on foreign direct investment among property public listed companies in Malaysia. Specifically, this study examines the effect of board of directors' characteristic namely board size, board meeting, board independence and CEO-Chairman duality role on foreign direct investment of the property public listed companies. This study relies on content analysis on the annual reports of 50 public listed property companies in in Malaysia for year 2007-2016. The results show that board meetings and board independency have a significant positive relationship on foreign direct investment of the public listed property companies. However, the results show that board size and CEO-Chairman duality do not have a significant relationship on foreign direct investment of the public listed property companies. The findings in this study implicate the importance of the board of directors' involvement in ensuring effective and efficient decisions related to foreign direct investment. (c) Sciedu Press.

Boards and their directors, a central aspect of the firm's leadership team, find themselves needing to be more accountable than they have ever been before. Accordingly, this chapter considers the corporate board and its ability to create value and to refocus the processes and outcomes of how it is held accountable. Initially, I start by looking at how stakeholder and shareholder views are largely complementary theoretical assumptions, both reflecting a social paradigm associated with the proper roles and responsibilities of firms. I then show how shareholder- and stakeholder-based views can be used to direct boards toward activities that reinforce one another by first outlining two main commonalities of both perspectives - accountability and value - and then illustrating how a board's accountability to both shareholders or stakeholders can lead to value being created in the long term for the other. Lastly, I show how organizational values shape perceptions of how value is created. (c) Joanne B. Ciulla and Tobey K. Scharding 2019.

The purpose of shareholders' involvement in the process of governance is to add corporate value and achieve better governance and firm performance (FP). However, corporate governance (CG) practices can vary from country to country and change over time. This study examines the moderating influence of shareholders' activism (SA) on the CG effectiveness - FP relationship in non-financial companies listed in the Libyan Stock Market between 2007 and 2016. CG effectiveness was the independent variable and consisted of five dimensions: board of directors, monitoring committee, audit committee, nomination and compensation committee, and ownership. Leverage, firm age and firm size were used as control variables. Return on investment was used to assess the corporate performance. SA was tested as a moderating variable using the interactive regression models. The study found out that the CG effectiveness is positively and significantly related to return on investment (beta = 0.608, p < 0.01). This relationship was strengthened by SA (R2 = 0.053, P < 0.05). Overall, the study shows that SA boosts the relationship between CG and FP in the Libyan Stock Market.

The Business Roundtable, a large group of top CEOs, recently issued a statement defining the purpose of the corporation in stakeholder terms, a direct and intended reversal from an earlier statement that defined the duty of directors as serving the interests of stockholders. In this editorial, we briefly describe the major twists and turns in the stockholders-versus-stakeholders debate that make this statement so significant to management theory and practice. We then describe the implications of the statement for scholars and practicing managers. We end with a description of three specific research topics that require more research in light of this statement: firm boundaries, the nature of value creation systems, and theory regarding the destruction of stakeholder value.

Overwhelming evidence from prior research suggests a positive association between corporate board characteristics and carbon performance; however, very little is known about the mechanisms linking the two variables. This study attempts to fill this gap by developing and empirically testing a conceptual model that highlights the role of carbon strategy in the relationship between board environmental orientation (BEO) and carbon performance. We argue that BEO can directly and indirectly influence carbon performance through carbon strategy. Using structural equation modelling to analyse data consisting of 2,301 U.S. firm-year observations over the 2005-2015 period, we find that the greater the BEO is, the better its carbon performance (i.e., lower greenhouse gas emissions). The results also provide evidence of the mediating effect of carbon strategy on the relationship between BEO and carbon performance. Splitting the sample into high and low carbon-intensive industries shows a partial mediation effect in high carbon-intensive industries and a full mediation effect in low carbon-intensive industries. The findings of the study and its implications for scholars, policymakers, managers, investors, and environmentalists are discussed. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the mediating role of board effectiveness (understood as the capacity to efficiently manage and control all functions to guarantee the company's prosperity) in the relationship between board diversity and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use partial least squares methodology to test the direct and indirect relationships between gender diversity in boards of directors and business performance. Findings: Although the relationship between the presence of women on the board and the board's effectiveness is statistically significant, this relationship is negative. However, board effectiveness (measured by the three constructs: strategic control, organizational innovation and decision-making) has a positive and statistically significant effect on business performance. Finally, there is a positive, but not statistically significant, relationship between gender diversity and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: The study has a small sample size, and most of the boards of directors analyzed are unequal with only a few companies achieving gender parity. Social implications: Public institutions must promote actions to achieve a critical mass of women directors and managers, so that women transcend a merely "symbolic" role on a board and are able to develop their skills and characteristics, thereby improving a board's effectiveness and business performance. Originality/value: This paper makes a theoretical contribution to the diversity and governance literature by providing a better understanding of the relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance. It considers the influence of women on the board through a holistic framework, analyzing the mediating role of the board's effectiveness. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We investigate the relation between board gender diversity and firm profitability using the control function (CF) approach recently suggested by Wooldridge (2015). The CF method takes account of the problem of endogenous explanatory variables that have potential to bias the results. Using a sample of firms that made up the S&P 500 over the period 2004-2015, we find that the presence of women on corporate boards (measured either by the percentage of female directors on corporate boards or the Blau index of heterogeneity) has a positive and significant (at the 1% level) effect on firm profitability (measured by the return on assets). We compare our results to more traditional approaches (such as pooled OLS or the fixed-effects model). Through this study, we shed light on the effect of women on corporate boards on firm performance, as it is still a controversial issue (Post and Byron, 2015). (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the link between board of directors' roles namely strategy, service and control roles and ambidextrous innovation. This study also aims to determine whether the independence and gender diversity of boards have mediating effects in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: On the basis of a quantitative approach, the authors conducted a survey on all Tunisian-listed firms. A partial least square method was used to analyze the quantitative data. The authors also conducted semi-structured interviews with a sample of boards' members of the surveyed firms followed by a thematic analysis of the discourses to discuss the results. Findings: Results revealed that ambidextrous innovation is negatively linked to board's control role. The outcomes of this research show also that ambidextrous innovation is positively associated with board's service role and that the gender diversity moderates positively this link. Findings do not indicate a significant relationship between board's strategy role and ambidextrous innovation but show evidence that the relationship is negatively moderated by independent directors, while positively moderated by gender diversity. Originality/value: This research sheds light on the effects of Boards' roles on ambidextrous innovation and the moderating effect of board's gender diversity and independence as well. This paper addresses the gap in the literature as this thematic has not been studied, offering key insights with regard to corporate governance of companies looking to achieve ambidextrous innovation.

We investigate the effect of politically connected boards (both supervisory boards [SBs] and boards of directors [BODs]) on cost of debt and equity capital of listed companies in Indonesia which has established a two-tier corporate governance system. The results, based on 250 firms, suggest that companies with politically connected SBs experience lower cost of debt and equity capital, whereas politically connected BODs have no association with cost of either debt or equity. Furthermore, we find that family firms and firms belonging to business groups with politically connected SBs enjoy lower cost of debt and equity capital. Our main results are robust to alternative measures and to tests for endogeneity. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate the relationship between intellectual capital and corporate governance of Oman's financial sector companies. Intellectual capital has been found to successfully contribute to the economic wealth creation of firms in germane literature. Unfortunately, financial statements do not necessarily capture and reflect the contributions of intellectual capital, thereby leading to an information asymmetry between companies and users of financial statements. The research also investigates the relationship between corporate governance and intellectual capital efficiency across various financial subsectors. Design/methodology/approach: Data are collected from annual reports available on Muscat Securities Market for 31 listed financial sector companies for the period 2012 to 2016 and analyzed using a multiple regression model. Intellectual capital is measured using Pulic's efficiency measure of value-added intellectual coefficient (VAIC). Corporate governance individual components such as board characteristics, audit committee characteristics and ownership structure are presented as independent variables. Findings: The findings suggest that board size and frequency of audit committee meetings have a significant association with the intellectual capital efficiency of Oman's financial sector. VAIC and human capital efficiency of banks are also significantly influenced by most of the corporate governance mechanisms; however, other subsectors do not report such findings. Corporate governance of banks in comparison to other subsectors effectively engages in utilizing the potential of intellectual capital efficiency. Agency theory and resource dependency theory find limited support as a result of this study. The GMM results are not robust to the alternative instruments. Research limitations/implications: The sample size is small as the study is limited to the listed financial sector of Oman. Future studies can be extended to include all of Oman's or GCC's listed companies. Additionally, the intellectual capital is measured using the construct of VAIC which suffers some limitations and can be overcome using other tools such as content analysis. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that Oman's regulators can create an awareness strategy on highlighting the importance of intellectual capital for companies (board of directors and managers), investors, debtors and creditors. Further, Oman's Capital Market Authority and Muscat Securities Market need to strengthen the regulations related to intellectual capital. Originality/value: This study extends intellectual capital and corporate governance literature by presenting the research outcome for Oman's financial sector. It is useful for Oman's financial sector companies to direct corporate governance measures for driving value creation of firms through the management of intellectual capital efficiency.

This study investigates the impact of female directors (FDs) on investment efficiency in a competitive environment. Considering Chinese market, where corporate governance practices are weaker than other developed countries and empirical evidence regarding the role of female directors in shaping investment efficiency is absent, this study fills this gap by studying the role of the female directors in investment efficiency in a competitive environment. The results show that FDs improve the investment efficiency in the firms as they play a monitoring role, discipline the management, reduce agency problem, and improve efficient allocation of resources. The results also exhibit that FDs significantly curb the overinvestment problem. However, FDs do not play a significant role in reducing underinvestment problem. The study facilitates to understand the factors that help in efficient allocation of resources in an economy. This study can be helpful for the policymakers while devising corporate policies to promote and encourage gender diversity in higher management. (c) 2019, Eurasia Business and Economics Society.

This paper examines the influence of the size of firms' board of directors on corporate social performance through a meta-analytic perspective. To that end, a sample of 80 articles that draw on evidence from more than 80,000 international companies, published between 1997 and 2018, was examined. This paper analyzes the moderating effect of a set of corporate governance mechanisms such as board composition and corporate governance systems on the hypothesized relationship between the size of firms' board and corporate social performance. Our central results reveal that larger and more independent boards better represent stakeholders' sensitivities and allow companies to achieve their social objectives. Moreover, that connection is more positive and stronger in companies with more independent boards and in countries that have codified law, which often have fewer mechanisms to protect shareholders' interests.

Research Question/Issue: The role of the board chair has become increasingly complex in recent decades. Research on corporate governance has called for and has initiated the pursuit of more research for the purpose of creating a better understanding of the role of board chairs. We reviewed 234 academic articles published in 66 journals, structured the existing research according to an Input-Process-Outcome-Contexts framework, and provided a future research agenda for studies on the role of the board chair. Research Findings/Insights: Our review reveals that the number of published studies on the position of the board chair has grown over the last two decades. Although extant research is dominated by quantitative studies exploring the impact of the board chair position on financial performance, frequently drawing on agency and stewardship theory, recent work has moved beyond this focus and has added valuable insights. The Input-Process-Outcome-Contexts framework used to structure the extant research reveals that future research should pursue topics related to all components of the framework and that opportunities exist to draw from a broader set of theories. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Based on the framework, we formulate seven specific research topics that can add valuable insights into the role of the board chair and suggest theories that can help inform research pursuing these topics. Taken together, these topics have the potential to create valuable insights into how board chairs are appointed, develop competencies, and interact and work with the CEO, the top management team, the board, and other stakeholders while acknowledging the influence of contextual factors, such as ownership, diversity, the firm's development stage, and external events and trends. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our review shows a growing global movement toward prescribing more corporate governance regulations and separating the positions of the board chair and the CEO. We show that many aspects need to be considered when choosing a governance configuration and when appointing a board chair because this role is becoming increasingly demanding.

Purpose: This study aims to draw on the resource dependence theory to synthesize the conflicting arguments as well as commonalities of the agency and stewardship perspectives on the relationship between CEO duality and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: Multiple regression analysis is used to analyze the data collected from a sample of 212 large-scale publicly listed companies representing 20 sectors in the Colombo Stock Exchange in Sri Lanka. Findings: The research results based on all of 212 publicly listed companies in Sri Lanka show, in support of the agency theory, that CEO duality exerts a negative effect on firm performance when the CEO is equipped with additional informal power. Conversely, CEO duality exhibits a positive effect on firm performance when board involvements are high, a finding that supports the commonalities of the agency and stewardship theoretical perspectives. Practical implications: By examining the governance practices and concepts in an Asian developing economy, this study provides insight into the power dynamics between the CEO and the board of directors in managerial contexts that are largely different from those in western countries. Originality/value: This study expands the theoretical underpinning of corporate governance research by identifying the performance implications of CEO duality within the broad context of the resource provision of the board of directors and the informal power of CEOs.

Business and politics are now more connected than ever. In Canada, more than 50% of listed companies have political connections through the board of directors or top management. These ties can give companies the resources they need to achieve their goals and possibly even confer a substantial advantage that results in better financial performance. To this end, political connections must influence the various choices and behaviours of politically connected companies, such as their voluntary disclosure strategy. As this type of influence has rarely been investigated in the literature, the current study looks at the impact of board and top management political connections on the voluntary disclosure behaviour of Canadian firms. Four types of voluntary disclosure--environmental, social, governance and total--are analyzed. Results show that politically connected companies make broader voluntary disclosures than non-connected firms do. Board and top management political connections are positively and significantly related to total voluntary disclosure, and board political connections are positively and significantly related to governance disclosures. In addition, top management political connections are positively and significantly related to voluntary environmental and social disclosures. This study is the first to shed light on the link between political connections and the voluntary disclosure of Canadian listed companies, as well as the first to confirm that not all political connections are equal. The impact of these connections on companies' choices and behaviours can differs according to the politically connected actor's position in the company, including on the board of directors or in top management. This difference could be explained by the fact that while board are generally concerned about strategic issues, top management deal with operational aspects. Consequently, they may not have the same behaviours and choices. (c) 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Purpose: This study aims to investigate whether female directors have an effect on company financial performance in a patriarchal emerging country that has a collectivistic culture with a substantial gender equality gap and is characterized with a paternalistic management culture. In addition, it aims to investigate whether the affiliations of female directors matter performance-wise in a setting where the majority of the companies are ultimately controlled by large business groups including families. Design/methodology/approach: The current study uses a unique hand-collected data set that covers all non-financial public companies quoted at the Borsa Istanbul between the years 2009 and 2017. To investigate the relationships between the presence and ratio of female directors and company financial performance, the current study uses the pooled ordinary least squares method, as well as the firm-fixed effects method to overcome potential omitted variables problems and various generalized method of moments methods to overcome potential reverse causality problems. Findings: The findings of the current study demonstrate that the presence and percentage of female directors both have a positive effect on company financial performance in a cultural setting where the opposite might be expected. They also present evidence suggesting that the effect becomes larger as the level of the independence of female directors becomes greater. Originality/value: The current study demonstrates that the presence of female directors on boards has a positive effect on company financial performance, even in a cultural setting that is very different from those of countries where the majority of previous studies on female directors are conducted on. In addition, it demonstrates how company financial performance varies with the level of the affiliation of female directors. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This paper aims to reexamine the link between board racial diversity and firm performance. It focuses on the mechanism through which board racial diversity could affect performance. The paper proposes and empirically tests the role of employee productivity and R&D productivity in the relationship between board racial diversity and firm financial performance. Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a mediation analysis framework with the bootstrapping method to test both the direct and indirect effect of board diversity on firm performance. The data used in the study come from S&P 1500 with variables composed from COMPUSTAT, Institutional Shareholder Services and Wharton Research Data Services. Findings: Contrary to prior findings, the results indicate that there is neither direct effect of board racial diversity on firm performance nor is there an indirect effect through either employee productivity or R&D productivity. Research limitations/implications: Because the data used in the paper are based on large public firms, the results may not generalize to small or private firms. Practical implications: The findings of the paper suggest that not all diversity measures matter in the same way and firms should carefully make board appointments to reduce the perception that they select directors for any reason other than qualifications. Originality/value: The paper advances the literature on board diversity by examining two previously unexplored mediating variables of employee productivity and R&D productivity. It also uses more rigorous mediation analysis with bootstrapping method and a validation sample to improve robustness of the results. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The paper examines the influence of corporate governance (CG) and earning quality (EQ) on corporate value (FV) of Vietnamese enterprises. The study uses GLS regression and linear structure model using data collected from companies listing on the stock market in Vietnam during 2008-2018, with a total of 2,937 observations. The research results indicate that EQ and CG represented by the Integrated Board of Directors and the Integrated Supervisory Board have a positive effect on FV directly and indirectly. The results show that the Integrated Board of Directors has a positive effect on EQ, whereas the Integrated Supervisory Board has a negative effect on EQ. Based on the research results, we suggest that companies need to strictly comply and implement GC, so to bring down the agency cost and consequently to increase performance. The companies also should establish the Board of Director of a proper size, with financial and accounting specialty, and including women board members. The government also needs to improve the management mechanism asking for firms to prepare and publish financial statements with reliable company information, which could be provided to users. These recommendations are a useful basis to help businesses improve FV via changes in the corporate governance factors in each enterprise. (c) The Author(s).

Purpose: This study aims at examining the level of risk of disclosure practices and the effect of four board of directors' characteristics (board size, board meetings, CEO duality and board expertise) on these practices in the Jordanian context. This study also adds to the body of literature by examining the moderating effect of family ownership on the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and the corporate risk disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: The sample of this study contains the non-financial Jordanian firms listed on Amman Stock Exchange (ASE). 376 annual reports of the sampled firms over four years from 2014 to 2017 were used. The content analysis approach was used to collect data and to determine the level of risk disclosure by computing the number of risk-related sentences in the annual reporting. To test the study's hypothesis, the random effect model was employed. Findings: The empirical results show that the total of the risk disclosure sentences for each firm ranges from a minimum value of 2 sentences to a maximum value of 61 sentences, and the mean of CRD is 28 sentences. The results also indicate that the board expertise is positively related with the level of risk disclosure. Conversely, CEO duality has a negative impact on the risk disclosure practices. However, the results failed to support that the board size and the board meetings have a significant effect on the level of risk disclosure. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that the family ownership moderates the relationship between the board of directors and the corporate risk disclosure. Practical implications: The finding of this study is more likely be useful for many concerned parties, researchers, authorities, investors and financial analysts alike in understanding the current practices of the risk disclosure in Jordan, thus helping them in reconsidering and reviewing the accounting standards and improving the credibility and transparency of the financial reports in the Jordanian capital market. Originality/value: The current study contributes to the literature of risk disclosure because the previous research has paid little attention to this topic in Jordan. To the best knowledge of the researcher, this study is the first Jordanian study that focuses on examining the relationship between the board of directors' characteristics and the corporate risk disclosure in the non-financial sector. Furthermore, it is the first study that examines the moderating role of family ownership on such relationships. Consequently, the results of the current study draw attention to the CRD practices and the monitoring role of board of directors in Jordan. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This work seeks to contribute to the debate about whether or not family businesses are more innovative than other kind of companies, and explore the specific effects women on boards have on innovation, comparing family and non-family businesses. Data collected from Spanish listed companies belonging to innovative sectors between 2003 and 2017 confirm that being a family business impacts positively on the number of registered patents and the proportion of women on boards exert a positive influence on R&D and patents. Moreover, the proportion of women on boards influences innovation in a different way when family and non-family businesses are compared, and depending on whether female directors belong or not to the family of control. Therefore, the results obtained suggest some relevant recommendations for research and practitioners, providing new insights into the debate on the benefits of family companies for innovation and of gender diversity of their boards.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of gender diversity among the board of directors (BOD) and Shariah supervisory board (SSB) members on the financial performance of Islamic banks in Indonesia and Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: Data for a sample of 19 Islamic banks for the period 2010-2018 were collected to test the research hypotheses using pooled ordinary least squares estimation method. Generalized least squares estimation method was used to confirm that the results are robust. This study lagged the explanatory variables by one period to control for potential endogeneity. Findings: The findings suggest that Islamic banks with more gender-diverse BOD and SSB are expected to have better financial performance. In addition, this paper finds that an increase in Islamic banks' size may undermine the positive impact of gender diversity among SSB members on Islamic banks' financial performance. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted only on Islamic banks in Indonesia and Malaysia owing to data constraints; thus, the results may not be generalizable to Islamic banks in other countries. Practical implications: Improving financial performance is crucial for banks, especially for Islamic banks, to sustain their fast-growing share globally. Therefore, the findings of this study are expected to provide insight and understanding in the selection and appointment of BOD and SSB members at Islamic banks. Social implications: By having women represented in the BOD and SSB, Islamic banks will benefit equally from valuable abilities across demographic groups in the society. Furthermore, if the members of the BOD and SSB are properly selected, Islamic banks with more gender-diverse boards can effectively contribute to enhancing social welfare of various segments in the society. Originality/value: This is the first study, as far as is known to the authors, that provides empirical evidence on the influence of gender diversity among BOD and SSB members on the financial performance of Islamic banks. This paper is expected to be used as a reference by the shareholders and customers of Islamic banks in ensuring that the BOD and SSB have the best optimal composition that maximizes their profits.

Drawing on resource dependence theory and group diversity research, this paper examines how board gender and racial diversity impact corporate divestitures. We argue that due to the diverse experiences, knowledge, and perspectives that female and racial minority directors bring to the boardroom, it is more difficult and time-consuming for the board to reach a consensus and pursue a common course of action. Consistent with this argument, our results indicate that board gender and racial diversity lead to longer divestiture completion times and a lower divestiture rate. Additionally, we argue that due to their cognitive heterogeneity, diverse boards likely exchange a greater variety of information, engage in more thorough discussions, and implement greater oversight of divestitures, leading to more positive divestitures returns. Offering mixed support for this argument, we found that while gender diversity increased divestiture returns, racial diversity was associated with lower divestiture returns. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd

During recent years, there has been a growing interest in CEO narcissism across disciplines. Various scholars document that CEO narcissism is an important factor that should not be overlooked when analyzing various organizational outcomes and strategies. Research on CEO narcissism has focused on its negative implications on organization outcomes. However, little attention has been paid to its effect on corporate social responsibility (CSR). This study explores the relationship between CEO narcissism and two distinct facets of CSR (stakeholder management and social issue participation), while taking into account the moderating role of outside board of directors. Using a sample of publicly traded U.S restaurants, the results document that an outside board of directors plays a moderating role on the relationship between CEO narcissism and the two distinct facets of CSR.

Corporate governance research suggests that boards of directors play key roles in governing company strategy. Although qualitative research has examined board-management relationships to describe board involvement in strategy, we lack detailed insights into how directors engage with organizational members for governing a complex and long-term issue such as product innovation. Our multiple-case study of four listed pharmaceutical firms reveals a sequential process of board involvement: Directors with deep expertise govern scientific innovation, followed by the full board's involvement in its strategic aspects. The nature of director involvement varies across board levels in terms of the direction (proactive or reactive), timing (regular or spontaneous), and the extent of formality of exchanges between directors and organizational members. Our study contributes to corporate governance research by introducing the concept of board behavioral diversity and by theorizing about the multilevel, structural, and temporal dimensions of board behavior and its relational characteristics.

Purpose: Human capital has been traditionally viewed in terms of how an individual's investment in knowledge, skills and abilities can lead to higher pay or promotions. More recently, human capital has been regarded as a unit-level resource using the term "human capital resources" to consider the aggregate effects of human capital. The purpose of this paper is to examine the collective human capital present in a firm's board of directors as a valuable resource leading to superior firm outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: The study examined the effects on firm innovation of the scientific expertise of corporate directors, average board tenure and the presence of a firm's founder on the board. Data from a sample of pharmaceutical firms were analyzed with the dependent variable, innovation, measured as patent applications and both individual and unit-level human capital measures of the predictor variables. Findings: The results show that the presence of a founder-director is positively related to innovation and more pronounced when combined with the board's scientific expertise. Board tenure shows a relationship to innovation and is more evident in combination with the board's aggregate level of scientific expertise. The effect of directors' scientific expertise is also greater when measured at the board level of scientific expertise. Research limitations/implications: Future studies should examine these relationships within a broader context extending the research to other industries thereby incorporating wider variation in both the antecedents and measures of innovation. In addition, future studies might investigate a likely non-monotonic relationship of board tenure with strategic outcomes, recognizing the non-linear nature of effects of board tenure. Practical implications: In addition to the theoretical and empirical implications, this research may also inform practicing managers charged with constituting their boards of directors and provide some guidance for the recruitment and retention of board members. The research may also assist top managers and investors in knowing when the presence of a founder on the board is useful and supportive of the firm's strategic direction. Originality/value: The study extends scholarly understanding of human capital theory beyond the top management team to boards of directors demonstrating the importance not only of directors' individual capital but also how it combines with that of other directors. Moreover, it enhances understanding of board characteristics beyond the bounds of demographic characteristics to show that additional qualities affect firm strategy. This research also informs managers, boards and investors how boards might be more effectively constituted to impact firm strategy. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The purpose of this study is to understand the dynamic relationships between managerial human capital, dynamic managerial capabilities and strategic change within boards of directors. Building on the dynamic managerial capabilities perspective and upper echelons theory, we theorize and investigate the impact of managerial human capital on strategic change as well as the mediating role of boards' sensing, seizing and reconfiguring abilities, defined as dynamic managerial capabilities. The hypotheses are tested on a sample of 606 Norwegian firms. The main findings suggest that while managerial human capital positively impacts strategic change, boards' sensing and seizing abilities (not reconfiguring) positively mediate the relationship between human capital and strategic change. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the effect of royal family members on firm performance of publicly listed companies in Saudi Arabia. Design/methodology/approach: Using 491 firm-year observations of non-financial publicly listed firms in Saudi Arabia's stock market between 2009 and 2013, the study employs, besides others, the advanced econometric technique GMM-system estimator. This allows the dynamic nature and control of the endogeneity problem to be accounted for in corporate governance and firm performance. Findings: The main result is that the attendance of royal family members at board meetings negatively influences firm performance but does not have an influence on firm value. The results also show that firms with many independent royal family members on the board of directors have better firm performance and firm value. In addition, firms with a high number of royal family members presenting on the board have better firm performance. Research limitations/implications: This study offers guidance to assist the further investigation of the SA Royal Family's BoD membership either in SA or in other monarchy countries. It is interesting to compare these results in order to further understand the different effects that the Royal Family's BoD membership have in such countries. This study's results suggest that independent members of SA's Royal Family on the BoD have some influence on firm performance in both the short and long term. Thus, policymakers should encourage the members of SA's Royal Family to become more involved in firms' BoDs. Practical implications: This study offers guidance for further investigation of royal family members in the region or in other monarchy countries. It will be interesting to compare these results. The study suggests that royal family members on the board have a partial influence on firm performance, especially the independent ones. Thus, the policymakers should encourage more involvement of independent royal family members on the board. Social implications: Foreign and minority investors, who invest in SA's publicly listed firms, should note that when independent members of SA's Royal Family are on the BoD their investment will benefit from the reduced risks and uncertainty. Originality/value: To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first study undertaken to investigate empirically the influence a royal family's presence on the board of directors has on firm performance. This study is based on both theories, namely the agency theory and resource dependence theory. (c) 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study explores how board leadership may influence the board dynamic managerial capabilities. We draw on the dynamic capabilities perspective to examine the effect of board chairs on the dynamic managerial capabilities of the board of directors. Using survey data from a sample of 410 Norwegian firms, our results reveal that board chair human capital is positively related to the board's sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring capabilities. Moreover, we find the positive effects of board chair human capital on board sensing and seizing capabilities to be stronger under higher environmental dynamism. Our study suggests that board chairs can play an important leadership role in developing dynamic managerial capabilities at the board level, particularly in more dynamic environments.

The aim of this paper is to bring together some of the foundational and recent literature interlinking corporate governance and the leadership role of the board of directors. Strategic leadership is widely assumed to be a responsibility that defaults to the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). However, in practice, what most CEOs do is strategic management rather than strategic leadership. While strategic management does share key aspects of strategic leadership CEOs are expected to prioritize the managerial side over the leadership side. This is just one of the situations in which the boardroom assumes the leadership role. This paper discusses how boards of directors conduct the process of strategic leadership in their organizations. In recent years there has been an increasing interest among scholars to understand how boards strategize from a behavioral point of view. This growing interest has resulted in the development of various typologies regarding boards' involvement in the strategic leadership processes.

This study examines the effect of Islamic banks' dual board governance mechanisms (Shariah supervisory board and regular board of directors) on technical efficiency; and whether the effect of such governance mechanisms varies between normal times and global financial crisis period. The results show that Shariah supervisory board contributes to reducing an Islamic bank's technical inefficiency. During the GFC, both SSB governance and regular board governance generate an incremental efficiency gain to Islamic banks, but the effect is more pronounced for SSB governance. The key findings on the governance-inefficiency relationship are robust to controlling for potential endogeneity of corporate governance. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Managerial oversight is strengthened and firms' strategic performance improved when boards are gender-diverse. Yet the rate of women's appointment to corporate boards is decelerating. This study proposes an explanation for the unexpected attenuation rooted in social movement dynamics, particularly cross-movement influences originating from the contemporary governance reform movement. Seeking to alleviate managerialist tendencies, the governance reform movement has compelled major changes to board structure, composition, and activity, as well as the broader logic surrounding corporate boards. By definition, social movements' cognitive and structural advances manifest "spillover" effects - unintentional impacts affecting the opportunity structure, and ultimately progress, of neighboring campaigns. Drawing on social movement theory, a conceptual model is outlined explicating the mechanisms by which governance reform's broad enactments have incidentally impeded board gender diversity's advance. Theoretically-grounded strategies for reversing those effects are also outlined and the study closes with a discussion of implications for research, practice, and policy. (c) 2020

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess whether the gender composition of the board of directors affects the sensitivity to gender issues in defining university strategies and therefore strategic plans. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted an ordinary least square regression to test the relationship between gender sensitivity approach and board composition in Italian state universities (ISUs). The authors measured the gender sensitivity approach of each university by an index (gender sensitivity approach index) determined based on content analysis. Gender board composition is, instead, analyzed by heterogeneity (homogeneity) index (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) of the board. Findings: The finding suggests that, if the board has a certain level of heterogeneity, then university strategic plan (USP) is a more gender-sensitive approach. Research limitations/implications: The study analyses only the 2018 USPs of ISUs and considers the presence of women within the board, and not their actual role and their position in the university hierarchy. Practical implications: The practical implication of this study is that if universities want to guarantee gender equality, they should open their boards more widely to women. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that analyzes the relationships between board composition and sensitivity to gender issues within the USPs. The paper therefore contributes to the literature on governance in the public sector, particularly in universities. Moreover, it stimulates the accounting debate on gender issue and highlights that gender issues cannot be taken up by decision-making bodies that are not heterogeneous enough.

Research Summary: Board scholarship has generally taken the perspective that when it comes to board expertise, more is better. This study, in contrast, explores contingencies that may stretch board experience beyond the limits of its usefulness. We integrate insights from extant research in board leadership and international strategy to identify and test internal and external contextual factors that can limit the effectiveness of boards' international experience. Exploring this in the context of cross-border M&As, we find evidence that the positive effects of boards' international experience are attenuated when the CEO lacks such knowledge, and when the institutional distance between the home and target countries is high. Overall, our findings suggest the need to exercise caution in viewing board expertise as a "panacea" of board effectiveness. Managerial Summary: Boards are generally viewed as experts that CEOs can look to for advice when formulating corporate strategy. Accordingly, the predominant view has been that the more relevant expertise on the board, the better the strategic advice they can offer. The results of our study, however, suggest that is not always the case. As it pertains to cross-border M&As, in order to get the maximum benefit from boards' international experience, CEOs must have enough international experience of their own, and the institutional environment of the target firm's country must not be too dissimilar from the acquiring firm's home country. Otherwise, it is possible that the boards' international experience will be stretched beyond its strategic usefulness. (c) 2020 Strategic Management Society

This paper explores the development and articulation of the agency and stakeholder theories of the firm and their corresponding logics of shareholder wealth maximisation and stakeholder interest optimisation. We note how these two perspectives have been viewed as diametrically opposite normative, instrumental and descriptive theories, despite efforts by some authors to find common ground. Each has served as a basis for firm governance. We explore the relationship of the agency and stakeholder theories to the conceptualisations of the roles of boards of directors, and how both theories hold value in understanding two board functions/roles: control/monitoring roles and service roles (which covers both resources and strategy).

This study investigates the effect of three categories of factors on the decision by financial companies to adopt the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). These factors are linked to (i) resources available to the firm (ii) the search for legitimacy and (iii) governance. Univariate and multivariate analyses are applied on a sample of 198 financial firms between 2006 and 2015. The results show that financial companies that are more likely to become PRI signatories have fewer available slack resources, are more scrutinized by the public, are bigger and have a board of directors characterized by greater gender diversity and independence than nonsignatory companies.

While boards of directors play a critical role in the formulation of strategic actions of family firms, up-to-date research examining the antecedents of boards' influence on strategic decisions remains limited. This study examines whether and how boards' task conflict impacts boards' control and advisory tasks, as well as to what extent these relationships vary with different degrees of boards' openness. Our main hypotheses are tested on a sample of 94 family firms from Norway. Our main findings confirm the complex and context-sensitive nature of conflicts in the context of family firms' boards of directors. In particular, we advance the debate by suggesting that task conflict benefits both boards' control and advisory tasks only when boards function in an atmosphere of openness. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

The governance of non-profit organisations is complex, as these organisations are not only intended to create value for third parties but also dependent on their donors. When the donor is a for-profit firm, it may be challenging to align and balance the firm's for-profit interests and the non-profit organisation's social aims. The board of directors has the main responsibility for supporting and monitoring managers' decisions so that all perspectives are considered, but doing so requires appropriate information about stakeholders' expectations. Adopting the agency theory perspective, this study focuses on corporate governance in corporate foundations (CFs), a type of non-profit organisation with a private firm as its founder and main donor. We hypothesise that bureaucratic control and coordination mechanisms between CFs and their founder firms, which are the main donors and consequently the main stakeholders, can increase the involvement of the board of directors, thereby leading to higher organisational effectiveness. We argue that the implementation of bureaucratic control and coordination mechanisms between a CF and its founder firm can strengthen corporate governance and provide the board of directors with the information needed to be more involved; such implementation fosters organisational effectiveness because it aligns the profit-oriented objectives of the founder firm and the social-oriented objectives of the CF. By analysing data from interviews of 188 CFs from six European countries, we aim to contribute to the debate on the role of corporate governance in non-profit organisations under the agency theory perspective. We provide evidence that the implementation of coordination and bureaucratic control mechanisms between a CF and its founder firm gives the board more information and leads to higher board involvement, thereby minimising agency issues and fostering organisational effectiveness.

Purpose: From the agency theory's point of view, this paper aims to analyze corporate governance mechanisms about the characteristics of the companies quoted in the segments Bovespa Mais and Bovespa Mais 2 and their influence on the creation of value in preparation for the opening of the initial public offering (IPO). Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach was adopted to achieve the proposed objective using the panel data with fixed effects and secondary data collected on the Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios website, using statistical software Stata(r) 13.0 for statistical tests. The population comprises non-financial companies belonging to the Bovespa Mais and Bovespa Mais Level 2 groups, as the survey sample took into account the period of adhesion of the companies, totaled in 15 companies, which cover the period from 2008 to 2019. The selected variables correspond to the ownership structure's characteristics, then the board's composition and the fiscal council as the body responsible for supervising the administrators' acts. Findings: The main results indicate that the number of independent members on the board of directors and the supervisory board's participation positively influence market performance. However, it also reveals that the concentration of ownership brings fundraising for other companies' acquisitions, risk reduction concerning information asymmetry between investing powers. Research limitations/implications: The main results indicate that the number of independent members on the board of directors and the supervisory board's participation positively influence market performance. Despite this, it also reveals that the concentration of ownership brings fundraising for other companies' acquisitions, risk reduction concerning information asymmetry between investing powers. Practical implications: This paper advances a comparative institutional perspective to explain capital market choice by firms making an IPO in a foreign market. This paper finds that internal governance characteristics (founder-chief executive officer, executive incentives and board independence) and external network characteristics (prestigious underwriters, degree of venture capitalist syndication and board interlocks) are significant predictors of foreign capital market choice by foreign IPO firms. Social implications: While product market choices have been central to strategy formulation for firms in the past, financial markets' integration makes capital markets an equally crucial strategic decision. This paper advances a comparative institutional perspective to explain capital market choice by firms making an IPO in a foreign market. Originality/value: This situation generates value to shareholders and is perceived by the market and, ultimately, generates a direct relationship with the market performance of companies. While product market choices have been central to strategy formulation for firms in the past, financial markets' integration makes capital markets an equally major strategic decision.

This study provides pioneering empirical evidence on board gender diversity and firm performance relationship for the case of large-scale agri-food companies in Russia. While Russia plays an important role in the global food security, its domestic agri-food production is heavily dependent on large scale producers. Our findings suggest a strong positive link between the percentage of female directors in boardrooms and firm performance. Moreover, in line with critical mass theory, boards with three or more female directors have greater impact on firm performance compared to boards with two or less female directors. Further analysis shows that the presence of female directors in the company has a positive impact on firm performance, mainly due to their executive, rather than monitoring effects. The paper shed light on gender diversity of Russian corporate boardrooms and provides empirical recommendations for policy makers as well as corporate executives in Russia. (c) 2019 Tleubayev et al.

High-growth firm is the research object of economic and business studies, because of its important influence on job creation, innovation, and tax revenues increase for the nation. This paper is designed to find some empirical evidence on the role of corporate governance on the firm's growth, thereby providing some policy implications for improving corporate governance activities in practice. Using a sample of 241 listed companies on Vietnam's stock market in the period 2008-2017, divided into 2 groups: high-growth firms and non-high-growth firms and applying a GMM regression with the dependent variable as 3-year compound growth rate, the study finds evidence of factors affecting the growing ability of corporate governance, namely: the ownership structure, the characteristics of the Board of Directors (size, independence, gender, non-executive member, experience), and the characteristics of the CEO (age, educational level, ownership, duality).

Despite the association between the board of directors and firm performance having been examined extensively in the literature, empirical evidence on whether and how boards contribute to firms' long-term success is scarce. Using 14-year panel data of all Australian listed firms, this study examines the effects of board potential and board dynamics, the key factors of board effectiveness, on firms' investment efficiency. We find strong evidence that both board potential and board dynamics are positively associated with firm investment efficiency. The findings support the view that both firms' resources and internal processes that enable boards to mobilize those resources to resolve complex tasks are critical for a firm's long-term success.

Purpose: This paper attempts to examine the activity and involvement of board of directors in internationalization activities of firms in emerging markets, by evaluating the resource provisioning roles of interlocks provided by board of directors, and the frequency of board meetings. We demonstrate that the effectiveness of board involvement is contingent upon the levels of family ownership in firms since family ownership could impact the firm's ability to utilize the presence of different types of board members. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test our hypotheses on a sample of listed Indian companies, extracted from the Prowess database published by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), a database of the financial performance of Indian companies. On a panel of 3,133 firm years of 605 unique Indian firms with foreign investments, over a time period of 2006-2017, the authors apply different estimation techniques. Findings: The results demonstrate that both board meeting frequency and director interlocks are instrumental in supporting internationalization activities in emerging market firms. However, family ownership moderates the role of insider and independent interlocks on internationalization investments in different ways; the authors find that interlocks provided by independent directors support internationalization activities in family firms, whereas those provided by insider directors do not. Further, the study also finds that board meetings are less effective in internationalization of family firms. Practical implications: The authors conclude that family firms aiming at international diversification require to develop more connected and networked independent directors to enable internationalization in firms. While independent director interlocks enhance the international investments, it is also useful to know that board meetings are ineffective in utilizing the resources in family firms. This points to the possibility that family firms should device mechanisms to integrate family meetings with board meetings so that they can utilize the within-family processes to aid in their internationalization decisions. Originality/value: The study contributes to resource dependence theory by understanding its limiting role in family firms. Theoretically, it helps delineate the limiting resource provision role of the insider directors vis-a-vis independent directors. The authors argue that the resource provision role of insider director interlocks does not effectively help in internationalization in comparison to independent director interlocks in family-dominated firms. Consequently, the study shows the limiting role of resource provision and utilization by family-owned firms in comparison to non-family-owned firms. (c) 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Based on the resource dependency theory, this article investigates the relationships among board gender diversity, innovation, and firm performance. Specifically, this article examines the mediating role of innovation, which may explain how board gender diversity is related to firm performance. Using a sample of 120 SBF companies from 2009 to 2012, the results indicate a negative effect of board gender diversity on innovation. In addition, we do not find evidence of a mediating role of innovation within the board gender diversity-firm performance relationship. (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

This article investigates the impact of women directors on financial outcomes--return and risk of Indian companies. It applies fixed and random effects Tobit regressions to examine the effect of female directors on financial outcomes (returns and risk) of the firm, controlling promoters' shareholding, leverage, firm growth and age, board size and board meetings. The study does not find any support to agency and resource dependence theories because the proportion of women directors in most Indian boards is too small to make much impact. However, it has a moderating influence to reduce variations in accounting profits and stock returns. The investors reward also meeting the regulatory quota of woman member on the boards by higher market returns indicating a signalling effect. The study adds an understanding of quota induced women directors' influence on the firm's financial outcomes. However, the regulators should be cautious in mandating induction of women members on the boards as they might be inexperienced or lack the needed grounding to effectively influence board processes.

This article studies the impact of the Board of Directors (BOD) on financial reporting quality (FRQ) in Vietnam listed companies. The research uses FEM, REM and GLS regression models, data collected at energy enterprises listed on the stock market in Vietnam from 2010-2018, with 2162 observations. The research results have found that the BOD size, BOD independence, BOD chairperson cum CEO has a positive impact on FRQ while BOD meeting frequency has a negative impact on FRQ. In addition, the audit quality, the ratio of liabilities has a positive impact on FRQ while company size has a negative impact on FRQ. Further, the percentage of female BOD members does not have an impact on FRQ. Empirical research results serve as a useful basis for enterprises to improve FRQ by considering of factors of the board of director in a more effective manner. (c) 2020, Sciedu Press.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore why different directors feel different levels of accountability toward board tasks. Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs a reflexive three wave data and analysis process culminating in a rich data set of 49 interviews with Australian directors and 15 h of boardroom observations. Findings: Differences in role identification lead directors to perceive their accountability differently resulting in wide variation in levels of firm specific knowledge, eventually affecting their breadth of contribution to board tasks. Research limitations/implications: Researchers should question the application of traditional governance theory (such as agency theory) if it fails to account for individual differences in intrinsic self-interest. Practical implications: Selecting board members for their functional knowledge alone may not always produce optimal outcomes for the board and firm. Board induction processes and ongoing director training are important tools to inform and remind directors of their role and accountabilities on a board. Originality/value: This paper establishes that the strength of directors' identification with either the director role or expert role affects what they feel accountable for, the development of firm specific knowledge and long-term efficacy as a director.

The paper examines the impact of corporate governance (CG) on firm value (FV) of enterprises in Vietnam. We consider the GC issue from the individual aspects of each member of the Board of Directors (BOD). The research uses GLS regression model, data collected at energy enterprises listed on the stock market in Vietnam during the period 2008-2018, with 2937 observations. The research results have found that the size of the BOD has a direct impact on FV, while it is interesting that the Board of Directors' independence has a direct impact on FV when measured by market value, but is in an inverse relation with FV if measured at book value. In addition, BOD chairperson cum CEO has an inverse impact on FV and female BOD members do not have an impact on FV. Further, the research results also prove that an enterprise's size is directly related with its value, whereas financial leverage is inversely related with the enterprise's value. Empirical research results serve as a useful basis for enterprises to increase their value, thus enabling the consideration of factors of the board of director at each enterprise.

Nonprofit boards of directors are responsible for the governance of their organizations. Despite a wide literature on board governance, empirical studies have focused primarily on board characteristics such as board size, frequency of board meetings, or board member characteristics. Building on prior literature, we use qualitative interview and survey data from nonprofit board members and executive directors, respectively, to develop a board coaching framework to better understand how board dynamics, in particular staff support for board activities, can influence overall board performance. Our findings suggest the need to recognize the central role executives and staff play in nonprofit governance. (c) 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The number of women in the boards of directors has increased in a lot of international firms, in recent years, with the help of the gender quotas, but we do not know whether this fact leads to an increase in gender equality. Based on a literature review about gender diversity, business performance, and perceived gender equality, the present research investigates if perceived gender equality is present in the Italian listed companies, which are subjected to mandatory gender quotas, analyzing if differences between men and women exist. Given the fact that almost all Italian listed companies have reached the minimum threshold imposed by the law (20%), we analyze whether and which differences exist in perceived gender equality, between men and women, using a questionnaire based on previous studies in literature review. This paper contributes to expand the empirical studies and literature review emphasizing the relevance of identifying the presence of gender equality in the Italian listed companies to a better understanding of the perceptions within the boards of directors and to the differences between the two genders.

Establishing a corporate governance strategy that promotes the efficient use of organisational resources is instrumental in the economic growth of a country, as well as the successful management of firms. This book reviews existing literature and identifies board structural features as key variables of an effective corporate governance system, establishing a multi-theoretical model that links Board structural characteristics with firm performance. It then, using a comprehensive empirical study of 265 companies listed on the Karachi Stock exchange, tests this conceptual model. This research serves as a significant milestone, reflecting the socio-economic setting of emerging economies, and highlighting the need for the corporate sector in emerging markets to move away from a 'tick-box' culture. It argues that the sector needs to implement corporate governance as a tool to mitigate business risks; appoint and empower non-executive directors to achieve an effective monitoring of management; and establish their own ethical and governance principles, applicable to the Board of Directors. Based on an extensive data base, collected painstakingly over five years, this book offers new insights and conceptual framework for further research in this area. Given the breadth and width of the research, it is a useful source of future reference for students, researchers and policy makers.

This book takes the central issues facing board members today and applies the giving voice to values framework while also providing insights from practicing board members who have faced these issues. It covers such topics as strategic planning and monitoring, director independence, privacy and cyber risk, executive compensation and CEO succession planning. With this book, readers will also grapple with the conflicts of interest that might arise in the director selection process, role of the nominating committee and the compensation committee in order to cultivate more optimal board dynamics. The principles of giving voice to values start by asking a deceptively simple question: 'What if you were going to act on your values-what would you say and do?' The book then provides an overview of the current landscape of corporate governance along with the major rules and director duties applicable to the board of directors. The book's latter chapters contain a series of five scenarios common to the board of directors that are presented as a set of "Board Challenges" involving the tensions often found in board work. In Giving Voice to Values in the Boardroom, the author, Cynthia E. Clark, provides practical strategies for board members and other constituents of corporate governance to deal with these challenges. These cases are designed to help users of the book implement prescripting and action planning. Each case will also have discussion questions about the stakes and stakeholders, common reasons and rationalizations and examples of how firms and governance professionals have handled similar board challenges.

The composition of the boards of directors is a key aspect for the development of companies. The increase of the women presence in the labor market is not translated as a significant increase in the gender diversity of the boards. In this work, the determinants of gender diversity in the boards of Spanish listed companies in the period 2001-2018 have been analyzed. Economic, financial and corporate governance factors have been considered. ROE is found as a determining and positive factor of gender diversity on the Spanish boards. The results show that the implementation of a gender diversity policy by the company, as well as a corporate social responsibility committee positively affect the percentage of women in the boards of directors of the listed firms. Industries show diverse and, sometimes, opposite effects among the factors considered. Our results can help regulators to propose policies and incentives to achieve larger gender diversity in the boards and management positions. (c) 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This paper examines the impact of banks' corporate governance mechanisms in terms of ownership structure, board size and composition on the loan quality in the Tunisian banking sector. To do so we use panel data method and a sample that contains the ten largest banks in Tunisia over the period 2001-2012. Our main findings show that ownership concentration worsens loan quality in the Tunisian banking sector. However, the presence of independent members in the board of directors improves loan quality through better monitoring actions. Our findings also suggest that Tunisian banks with CEO duality manage better their loans. Copyright (c) 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Boards of directors affect corporate strategy and decision-making through monitoring of management and resource provision. Recently, an increasing number of studies have examined the relationships between board characteristics and corporate social responsibility (CSR). These studies have yielded inconsistent findings. This article therefore reports the results of a study applying meta-analytical techniques to a sample of 82 empirical studies to help clarify the relationships between board characteristics and CSR. Although prior research has tended to apply relatively simplistic models investigating the impact of individual board characteristics independently and only directly, we adopt a more complex perspective to shed new light on the board characteristics-CSR nexus. Specifically, we use a meta-analytic path model that accounts for the potential interplay between board characteristics in determining CSR and tests whether the presence of a CSR committee plays a meditating role. Our findings suggest that board size, board independence, and female board representation are partially interrelated with each other and jointly influence CSR directly as well as indirectly via the presence of a CSR committee. In addition, we find that country-level institutional factors act as moderators and that the relationships differ with regard to the specific dimension of CSR (i.e., social, environmental, or aggregate).

The role of business sector in addressing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is increasingly recognised around the world. The SDG 5 Gender Equality has given impetus to actions in many countries in the form of gender equality and gender diversity in businesses. Rapid progress has been made recently in achieving gender representation on corporate boards with voluntary initiatives such as the 30% Club in Australia and other countries. This study differs from previous studies in that it considers the ethical and social dimensions rather an economic angle by examining the association between gender diversity and corporate social responsibility (CSR). The limited prior research with this approach has focused on the US and UK context with emphasis on analysing how female directors with their unique views, perspectives and specific experiences contribute to strategic decision making and for addressing issues that are of concern to society and stakeholders. Continuing in this vein, this study examines the association between gender diversity and positive and negative dimensions of CSR separately. For a sample of constituents of the ASX 300 Index and employing systems Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) methods, this study finds evidence supporting both the token theory and the critical mass theory. Both positive and negative dimensions of CSR are unrelated to gender diversity when there is a token female representation on the boards of directors. However, companies that have improved gender balance undertake more positive CSR activities and reduce negative or controversial activities that hinder CSR. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Investigating a sample of firms from the S&P 500 Index (between 2004 and 2015), the paper addresses the relationship between the representation of Women on Corporate Boards (WOCB) and the Corporate Social Performance (CSP). It adopts the instrumental variable quantile regression panel data (IV-QRPD) model, suggested by Powell (2016), to solve endogeneity and heterogeneity issues. The article shows a strong "threshold effect": the impact of board feminization on CSP is nonlinear and changes along the quantiles of the performance distribution. Highlighting a contextual and multilevel phenomenon, the paper contributes to the CG literature offering main achievements on board's dynamics and inclusiveness. (c) 2020

Boards of directors have recently become more attentive to their stakeholders' concerns, providing more transparent information and adopting more sustainable business strategies. This study investigates the influence of a critical mass of women on boards on the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure score and its three components separately. Using a sample of the FTSE-MIB listed companies in the 2005-2017 period, we show that reaching a critical mass of female board members--going from one or two women to at least three--enhances the level of ESG disclosure. The results also show that the critical mass of female board members has a positive influence on every component of the ESG score, with the highest contribution of women reaching the governance score. These findings provide insights to shareholders and policymakers and suggest that a critical mass of female board members is particularly effective in improving transparency, and it can be seen as a mechanism to transit to stakeholder governance, fostering more sustainable behavior in firms.

Research Question/Issue: We examine the impact of two differing types of employee board representation (i.e., labor board representation and employee shareholder board representations) on environmental, social, and corporate governance components of ESG performance and the moderating role of each type of employee board representation on the relationship between ESG performance and the firm's market value. Research Findings/Insights: Using a propensity score matching approach on a sample of French firms listed in the SBF 120 index from 2007 to 2017, our findings reveal that labor board representatives act in the opposite direction to employee shareholder board representatives by focusing exclusively on improving social performance and reducing environmental and corporate governance performance. The way employees are represented on the board of directors also moderates the corporate ESG-financial performance relationship differently. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Employee directors are not a homogenous group. The differentiation between the two types of employee directors (i.e., labor board representatives and employee shareholder board representatives) brings a deeper understanding of the effect of stakeholders' representation on the board. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results are of interest to governance policymakers because they provide them with a fresh understanding of the key role of employee board representation. A meaningful inference to be drawn from our findings is that employee ownership and the representation of employees on the board as employee shareholders may bring about fundamental changes in employees' attitudes and behavior on the board and may, in this regard, be considered as a credible way of generating social harmony and constructive relationships between employees and shareholders.

Previous research about the effects of board structure and process on the firm financial performance is based on conflicting theoretical perspectives, and empirical results, mostly based on regression analysis, are inconclusive. Building from Complexity Theory and configurational analysis, this study offers clarity to inconclusive previous empirical results about the link among several board features and firm financial performance. From a sample of 295 non-financial firms from Southern Europe for the period 2001-2010, and by using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, findings of this study show that firm financial performance depends on a complex configuration of several board features (board size, board independence, leadership structure and board activity) and several corporate characteristics (firm size, firm leverage and firm age). This paper has implications for academics. Despite different theoretical arguments and inconclusive results of the wide empirical literature addressing the effect of board characteristics on the firm performance, building from Complexity Theory this paper adds to our knowledge because it empirically explores under which circumstances different board features should contribute positively or negatively to firm performance. The results of this study have also implications for policy makers and practitioners by providing some useful hints to the controversial relationship between corporate governance and financial performance. In this sense, general corporate governance recommendations must be rethought. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Prior research suggests that corporate boards and directors play important roles in firm strategy and performance. In this paper, we examine an important yet under-explored avenue and focus on their role in overcoming the multilevel psychic distance (PD) faced by internationalizing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) originating from an emerging market. Analysing Indian Fintech SMEs, using multiple case studies, our findings reveal that boards contribute important network-level resources and knowledge about foreign markets, which in turn assists internationalizing SMEs in mitigating PD. We demonstrate that the human and social capital of boards play important, yet distinctly different, roles in mitigating PD at pre- and post-internationalization phases. At the pre-internationalization phase, directors' prior international and industry experience, as well as board interlocks and prior connections, are most valuable, whereas at the post-entry phase, transnational boards, and those with stronger trust-based personal relationships (i.e. greater depth of social capital, facilitate faster experiential learning. Taken together, our findings contribute novel insights into the mechanisms through which boards affect the outcomes of firms operating, and originating from, extreme institutional environments. Further, we draw implications for research and practice. (c) 2021 The Authors. British Journal of Management published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Academy of Management

The purpose of this research is to synthesise and critically evaluate the extant literature investigating the role of board of directors as a core element of corporate governance in corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance. Adopting a systematic review approach, a sample of 67 studies from 18 highly regarded scholarly journals published between 1992 and 2020 is examined. Distinguishing between two board attributes of director characteristics and board structures, our study uncovers similarities and inconsistencies regarding the effects of various board characteristics and board structures on CSR performance. First, our study reveals that these attributes do not work in isolation but interact with each other and the context in which they are embedded in shaping CSR performance. Additionally, our review identifies substantial variation in conceptualisations, theoretical frameworks, the use of measurements and the contexts across studies providing a basis to offer a comprehensive synthesis of dominant scholarly discourses and an organising lens for future scholarship.

Academic research is generally seen as one of the most important goals of a university, but universities are being called upon simultaneously to assist in building a local entrepreneurial ecosystem and contributing to economic growth. Universities can be the source of startups based on academic research results and thereby influence a given industrial context. This paper investigates the impact of academic entrepreneurship on the economic performance of university spin-offs (USOs) and, in particular, how the composition of the founding team, the diversity of academic ownership, CEO duality, and the presence of women on the board of directors affect USO success. We study these relationships with a cross-sectional sample of 136 firms in southern Italy. Our findings highlight that governance and ownership can influence various indicators that are often used for measuring enterprise success in different ways and that, based on the specific success metrics, managers or policymakers should consider different aspects to better understand a USO's potential for success.

The literature on gender diversity in boards of directors has expanded significantly in recent years, due to the fact that women are increasingly holding higher management positions within the company hierarchy, clearly demonstrating that certain characteristics of women have a positive impact on different areas within the company. The objective of this paper is to analyze scientific articles on the presence of women in boards of directors, based on a literature review, in order to learn about the evolution of this concept over time. The search conducted for this paper produced 300 documents from the Web of Science, with a final total result of 168 documents after passing the initial results through various filters. VOSviewer software was used to analyze the information, which enabled the creation of bibliometric citation, co-citation and co-word maps. The results reveal the most relevant authors and studies on this subject and identify the most current studies, the main topic of which deals with sustainability and corporate social responsibility, in addition to highlighting the characteristics of women that are of vital importance to boards of directors within the current context: empathy, open innovation, concern for the needs of interest groups and a heightened perception of risks.

Does the appointment of more women and ethnic minority directors on corporate boards help combat discriminatory work environments? This empirical study addresses this question by exploring the occurrence of large-scale discrimination lawsuits. Drawing from social identity theory and empathy-based perspectives, we propose that a greater presence of female and minority directors on boards reduces the likelihood of large-scale discrimination lawsuits given their propensity to advocate for underrepresented groups in the workplace. Our analysis of data from 452 US firms from 2010-2015 indicates that a higher proportion of female and minority directors on boards is associated with a lower likelihood of such lawsuits. Specifically, the likelihood of such lawsuits is lower where there are three or more (a critical mass) female and minority directors. "Token" appointments (one or two female or minority directors) do not reduce the occurrence of these lawsuits. Further, the joint presence of minority and female directors on boards significantly reduces the likelihood of such lawsuits. Finally, we found that female CEOs help in reducing the occurrence of such lawsuits when the board has two or more female directors. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of greater gender and ethnic diversity on boards in combating workplace discrimination. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

Purpose: This study aims to elucidate the relationship between women's participation on the board of directors and the company's financial performance in a sample of 45 Colombian companies listed on the Colombia Stock Exchange (CSE) (Bolsa de Valores de Colombia). Design/methodology/approach: Using 50,214 financial records of 45 companies listed on the CSE during 2008-2016, the authors performed panel data regressions to explore the relationship between the measures of gender diversity on boards and the impact on corporate financial performance. Findings: The authors show that the participation and presence of at least one woman on the board of directors are positively associated with firm financial performance as measured by return on equity (ROE), but not as measured by Tobin's Q. This second indicator is positively associated with firm financial performance when there are at least three female directors on boards of 10 or more individuals. Practical implications: The findings also provide evidence supporting the development of managerial and organizational mechanisms that strengthen female presence at the highest level of governance. Originality/value: The study demonstrates that female presence on boards has a positive impact on firms' financial performance, but the degree of diversity impacts differently ROE and Tobin's Q. These findings are based on a study of an emerging economy in Latin America, and data on similar economies are scarce. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: It has been over 20 years since the landmark publication of Mizruchi (1996) and his examination of "what do interlocks do?". Since then, the nature of interlocks and subsequent research on the subject has evolved. This paper aims to revisit the literature on interlocking directorates through a quantitative bibliometric analysis. Design/methodology/approach: This study undertakes a bibliometric analysis of literature citing the Mizruchi (1996) to examine the state of research following up on "what do interlocks do". This study examines 718 publications using keyword and co-word analysis, along with a thematic analysis to revisit the research that has followed Mizruchi's topic of what do interlocks do. Findings: This study finds that the topics of the corporate elite, capitalist economy and corporate governance have remained prominent themes in the field. Research areas that are emerging in the field of interlocking directorates include gender diversity, globalisation and advancing theoretical frameworks. Originality/value: This paper provides a quantitative bibliometric analysis to revisit the extant literature on "what do interlocks do", examining a high number of articles to identify areas which could be developed to advance research in the field.

The current U.S. climate of racial and social injustice has prompted a renewed call for diverse and equitable ways to rethink community philanthropy. Community foundations are vehicles for community philanthropy which offer vast benefits for social improvement and community development. The board of directors ensures these organizations fulfill their mission, making decisions on funding priorities and holding the organization functionally and fiscally responsible. Drawing on constructs of diversity and representative bureaucracy and a case study of Florida community foundations, we suggest that diversity is understood in different ways and the presence of diverse board members may be linked to advancing the interests of diverse communities and in achieving outcomes that assist in the needs of certain social groups. Increased understanding of diversity can improve foundation and philanthropic effectiveness and bring broader social change by promoting equity and social justice among community-based philanthropic organizations.

Using resource dependence theory, we analyze board interlocks, their industry origin, and their relationship to firms' greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Interlocks create connections by having board members from one firm sit on other firms' boards, providing an avenue for sharing information and resources to aid in knowledge transfer and capability development. As firms face challenges for improved GHG emissions performance, they may look to their board members' connections to other firms to acquire needed resources. Using a sample of US Standard & Poor's (S&P) 1500 firms for years 2009 to 2018, we find that firms with a greater number of board interlocks achieve lower GHG emissions intensity. We also find that boards for the best performing companies have interlocks in the same industry, in other industries, and with firms leading in GHG emissions intensity, especially for firms in higher environmentally impacting industries, as they face greater emissions challenges.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the relationship between a diverse set of corporate governance (CG) mechanisms and corporate sustainability disclosure (CSD) in Southeast Asian countries under national stakeholder reform. Design/methodology/approach: Data analysis is based on 171 of the largest companies across six Southeast Asian countries using a 30-item CSD measure. Findings: The authors find that there are wide variations in the levels of CSD across the countries. The findings indicate that board size, board gender diversity, block ownership and the presence of a sustainability committee are significant determinants of CSD. Additionally, whilst more stringent stakeholder governance reform motivates firms to publish more sustainability information, it fails to influence the effectiveness of the board of directors in promoting CSD. Practical implications: Findings of this study highlight the essential role internal governance structure plays in monitoring corporate actions and enabling corporations to reduce their legitimacy gap. The findings further encourage regulators and policymakers to question, with utmost importance, the effectiveness of stakeholder reform in making significant organisational changes. Originality/value: There is a dearth of studies that examine the CG-CSD nexus in relation to specific institutional characteristics. Existing studies mainly focus on a single country with similar institutional environments and thus limiting the ability to understand the "context specificity" of sustainability content development. This paper provides an overview of stakeholder reform in Southeast Asian countries and empirically substantiates the relationship between CG and CSD across six countries undergoing such reforms in the region.

This study contributes simultaneously to research on women board members and competitive dynamics by investigating two unresolved research questions: What is the effect of female directors on the firm's competitive repertoire? Under what conditions is this effect more pronounced? Leveraging the "Awareness-Motivation-Capability" (AMC) framework, we predict that having women on the board of directors should impact the complexity, heterogeneity, and volume of the firm's competitive moves. Relying upon a sample of U.S. pharmaceutical firms for the years 2000 to 2017, we find that adding female directors on the board positively affects the complexity and volume of a firm's competitive moves, but negatively impacts the heterogeneity of competitive actions. In addition, the presence of a female CEO moderates these effects, leading to more complex competitive actions and increased volume. Thus, our study lends a greater understanding of how female board members influence competitive dynamics and shape the strategic direction of the firm. (c) The Author(s) 2019.

This paper examines the impact of the gender and ethnic composition of corporate boards (board of directors and audit committee) on stock liquidity in the context of South Africa. More specifically, we focus on the interaction effects of gender diversity and ethnic diversity on stock liquidity. Using a sample of listed South African firms for the period 2009-2013, we find that firms with more female or black directors on corporate boards are associated with a higher level of stock liquidity. However, the interaction effect indicates that the positive impact of ethnic diversity on stock liquidity is attenuated with the greater presence of gender diversity. These findings are explained through board effectiveness and corporate information flows. (c) 2020 Accounting and Finance Association of Australia and New Zealand

This paper examines the effect of Board of Directors' (BD') roles and composition on exploratory, exploitative and ambidextrous innovations. A quantitative research was operated on Tunisian listed companies. Semistructured interviews were also realised with directors of these firms to discuss the findings. Results of the multiple regression analysis conducted indicate that BD' service role positively influences exploratory, exploitative and ambidextrous innovations. These types of innovation are negatively linked to BD' control role and not significantly associated with BD' strategy role, board independence and gender diversity. This paper sheds light on an innovative and unexplored topic in the literature, as prior studies focused on the effect of BD on innovation rather than on innovation types or even on ambidextrous innovation. This study provides interesting insights for firms that seek to improve their corporate governance. It highlights the BD' key attributes that firms must focus on to innovate.

Purpose: The objective of this paper is to investigate the emergence of corporate political activities (CPAs) in the form of social responsibility in the banking sector in Bangladesh. The use of institutional logics allows the authors to explore not only the motivations underlying this sudden shift in corporate approach towards corporate social reporting (CSR) disclosure but also to investigate whether a logical plurality exists in this new approach. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is based on 21 in-depth interviews with policymakers, regulatory bodies and top management and members of boards of directors in the banking sector. Findings: The findings of this study are both consistent with and different to those of Uddin et al. (2018). While their findings show that Bangladeshi companies engage in CSR activities primarily to demonstrate their allegiance with the ruling political regime driven by notions of traditionalism, this study's findings show the existence of a logical pluralism across industries in the manner they engage with CSR activities and disclosures. In addition to the dominant market logic, the authors also find the co-existence of community and family logics shaping the nature of CSR disclosures made by banking companies in Bangladesh. Originality/value: The authors contribute to the accounting and management literature by providing first-hand evidence of the motivations underlying the emergence of CPAs in the context of a developing country. The adoption of an alternative theoretical framework allows the authors to identify the multiple logics that dictate corporate attitude towards CSR engagement and disclosure.

In 2013, India became the first country in the world to require firms to spend two percent of their average profit on corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. Taking advantage of this unique event, we examine how the mandatory CSR compliance impacts conditional accounting conservatism of Indian firms. We find a positive relation between CSR compliance and conditional accounting conservatism and this relation is stronger for firms that have stronger governance and weaker for family firms. Further, we find that current period accounting conservatism is negatively related to next period CSR spending. Our results are robust to a battery of tests and are consistent with the notion that Indian firms enhance accounting conservatism to decrease earnings to minimize CSR compliance costs. In other words, while policy makers may have intended to use legislation to increase CSR activities by Indian firms, our results suggest that firms use accounting policies and negative accruals strategically to mitigate CSR spending.

Research Question/Issue: Despite the importance of political ties to firm strategy and performance, little is known about why and how firms form political ties. This study examines how firm-specific governance structures function as important determinants of the formation of political ties and how the impact of governance structures evolves during institutional transition of emerging economies. Research Findings/Insights: Our empirical analysis is based on a longitudinal data set involving manually coded political ties of listed firms in Taiwan between 1996 and 2005. We find that business group affiliation and family ownership facilitate the formation of political ties but that such effects diminish as market infrastructures and regulatory institutions develop. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study systematically examines how corporate governance structures affect the formation of political ties. It identifies an overlooked explanation for the dynamics of political ties that resides in the internal governance structures of firms. It contributes to the corporate governance research by demonstrating how governance structures other than the board of directors can provide resources to facilitate strategic actions such as political tie establishment. It also enriches research on corporate governance bundles by showing the interdependence among multilevel governance mechanisms in the context of political tie formation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights for business executives interested in managing interdependence with government. While business group affiliates and family firms are better able to link to politicians, such advantages diminish during institutional transition. Hence, group leaders and family owners should consider other political activities to effectively manage political risks as institutions develop. (c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

We examine the relation between borrowing firms' corporate political transparency and the cost of debt. Using a sample of S&P 500 firms over the 2012-2016 period, we document a significant negative association between firms' corporate political transparency and their cost of debt. We also find that the negative association is more pronounced when the borrowing firms are in less unionized industries and have younger executives (CEOs or board of directors). Our results are robust to a variety of sensitivity tests. (c) 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

This study empirically investigates the role of political connections in corporate environmental spending. It employs a sample of listed Chinese firms from polluting industries within the 2010-2013 period. Our empirical results show that having politicians as directors reduces the magnitude of discharge fees. We also find that such reductions are more pronounced in firms with a higher ratio of politically connected directors (i.e., listed Chinese polluting firms that are privately controlled). This negative relationship is robust to various model specifications (e.g., a sample of polluting firms after addressing the sample selection bias and reverse causality without an increase in new investment). Moreover, we observe that the negative relationship between political connections and discharge fees is stronger in listed Chinese polluting firms located in more polluted regions. Meanwhile, a polluting firm's incentive to engage in environmental protection, measured by firm-level environmental awards (incidents), alleviates (exacerbates) the negative relationship. Finally, the impact of politically connected directors on discharge levies is explicitly driven by having local officials and officials from the home province as directors.

Purpose: This study aims to construct two environmental disclosure indices (EDI), one obtained from the mandatory reporting (annual report) and the other from the voluntary reporting (sustainability report), to compare their evolution. In addition, the authors developed and evaluated a conceptual model that aims to analyse if the two EDI are affected by industry, environmental certification, lucratively and corporate governance attributes. The legitimacy, signalling and voluntary disclosure theories are used to support the theoretical relationship between the company's characteristics, corporate governance and environmental disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: Using the content analysis technique, the authors have developed two indices to assess the level of environmental disclosure in the companies' mandatory and voluntary reporting. In addition, to analyse the determinants of EDI, the authors applied the technique of multiple linear regression using panel data. Findings: Based on Portuguese listed companies (Euronext-Lisbon), the results, from 2015 to 2017, exhibited an increase of 14.6% and 25.8% for the EDI obtained from the annual reports and for EDI obtained from the sustainability reporting, respectively. In addition, the results revealed that the environmental certification, lucratively, number of members on board and number and proportion of women of the board directors tend to affect the annual reporting EDI. Regarding the sustainability reporting EDI, the results showed that the environmental certification, lucratively and proportion of independent members of the board of directors have an impact on it. Research limitations/implications: The study focuses on quantitative rather than qualitative disclosures and it brings some insights to the theoretical field. Practical implications: The results obtained can assist corporate decision-making processes regarding the improvement of environmental disclosure, both on the mandatory annual report and on voluntary sustainability reports. Originality/value: This study brings new perspectives to this topical issue in accounting. Originally, this study is applied to Portuguese listed companies and it shows different trends and determinants of environmental disclosure when included in the annual reporting or sustainability reporting.

Research question: This study investigates how boards of directors perceive their roles in Scottish football clubs. With previous studies focusing on amateur and non-profit sport organisations (primarily in Canada, Australia and New Zealand), this research answers the call for more research into board roles and in other sport contexts. Research methods: A qualitative design is adopted and 24 directors of Scottish football clubs are interviewed. Football club directors are a difficult to access population and this research represents a rare opportunity to understand the perspectives of key sport governance informants. Template analysis is employed. Results and findings: Findings show that perceived board roles fall into five categories: control, service, operations, resource co-optation and strategy. Organisational size was found to influence perceptions of board roles in Scottish clubs, while an apparent alignment of interests between owners and managers, and a subsequent reduction in agency cost, has implications for the control role. An integration of stewardship theory and resource-dependency theory is argued to provide a more holistic understanding of board roles in this context. Implications: The study responds to calls for a multi-theoretical approach to board roles research by developing an integrative stewardship-resource dependency theory. The integrated theory is argued to be useful in framing the complex dynamics of board roles in Scottish football. Future research is encouraged to assess whether the stewardship-resource dependency theory can provide an effective framework for understanding board roles in other sport settings.

Building on the argument that corporate boards are responsible for the creation and leveraging of a firm's intellectual capital (IC), this study empirically examines the relation between boardroom characteristics--namely board size, director independence, leadership structure and gender diversity--and IC efficiency. Additionally, we propose that the family firm (FF) status is a specific condition that moderates the effect of board features on IC efficiency. We test the above propositions using data on 113 nonfinancial firms continuously listed on the Italian stock exchange over the period 2011-2016. The empirical results indicate that (1) IC efficiency is significantly lower in FFs, which challenges previous research claiming that FFs have some performance advantages over non-FFs and (2) that board size and director independence have an opposite effect in FFs and non-FFs (positive and negative, respectively), suggesting that the role of individual board mechanisms as drivers of (or brakes on) IC efficiency is contingent on firm characteristics. This paper extends the empirical literature supporting the link between board composition and IC efficiency, which has been scant and inconclusive. Furthermore, the literature has seldom considered the firm contingencies potentially affecting this relation. Regarding practical implications, our findings indicate that there is no one best way of structuring corporate boards that can fit all firm conditions; specifically, the results call into question conventional 'best practices' of board composition that emphasise director independence, suggesting that this governance mechanism may not have a consistent effect on organisational outcomes such as IC efficiency.

Financial corruption has an extensive adverse impact on corporate stakeholders. Over the last two decades, numerous prescriptions have been offered to improve the governance of US public firms, yet financial corruption is still prevalent. Board of directors' audit committees are typically charged with the responsibility of assuring that the corporation's financial reports satisfy the criterion of accuracy. We propose that a quad-qualified audit committee director can serve as an exemplar corporate overseer of financial reporting and minimize the likelihood of corruption. We predict that by having the qualifications of independence, directorship experience and financial expertise, bandwidth, and stock ownership, the effectiveness of monitoring financial reporting by such a director will be considerably enhanced, thus complementing the benefits of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) enacted in 2002. To test our predictions, we employed a time-lagged, matched-pairs sample of 328 large US corporations (164 financially corrupt firms plus a comparison group of 164 compliant firms). Controlling for covariates, we found that the presence of a quad-qualified audit committee director reduced the likelihood of financial corruption in a public firm by 72%. Combined with the benefits from SOX, having at least one quad-qualified audit committee director decreased the probability of financial corruption by 92%. Our results also show that having just one quad-qualified audit committee director is more effective than the combination of the individual qualifications dispersed among the committee members.

This study explores diversity reporting by New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) listed companies, arguing that diversity goes beyond gender and includes differences in age, ethnicity, sexuality, religious beliefs and physical disability. We argue that gender diversity and deep diversity elements (race, age, sexual orientation, disabilities, ethnicity) have a synergistic relationship and that gender diversity objectives cannot be achieved without attaining diversity objectives in these other elements and vice versa. Designing a 30-item diversity disclosures index, this study undertakes a content analysis of the diversity-related disclosures made by 152 NZX listed companies. Analysing diversity-related disclosures in annual and sustainability reports, we find that the NZX listed companies predominantly relate diversity only to board gender diversity. Deep diversity elements at all organisational levels, however, do not receive much attention, with a few exceptions. Our results highlight that female representation on organisational boards has a positive impact on overall organisational gender and other diversity aspects and vice versa. The results of an emphasis on the totality of diversity have important implications for boards of directors, corporate managers and regulators interested in improving the corporate governance and diversity practices in New Zealand organisations.

Purpose: This study aims to explore corporate governance (CG) practices that can lead to firms' better performance in different organizational life cycles. The authors propose a configurational approach to explore how a set of CG practices combine in bundles to achieve high performance outcomes for firms across their corporate life cycles. Design/methodology/approach: Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis was used to analyze a sample of data of 21 countries and 9 industries. Data referred to the period of 9 years extending from the year 2005 to the year 2013. Findings: This study reveals that there are multiple CG practices that exist through firms that can achieve high firm performance. Moreover, CG practices combine in different ways for firms in their growth, maturity and declining stages. Research limitations/implications: This study demonstrates the value of using a configurational analytical approach to explore both the firm and country-specific CG practices (together) that engage firms to achieve the desired level of performance across the corporate life cycles. Practical implications: The current study draws attention to the policymakers' need to assess the current level of regulatory and competitive development of their countries and form policy accordingly. The approach used in the current research study not only offers the linkages between CG and performance to managers as incentives to comply with regulation but also to view CG-related activity as a strategic move. Social implications: The approach used in the current research study not only offers the linkages between CG and performance to managers as incentives to comply with regulation but also to view CG-related activity as a strategic move. Originality/value: This study broadening the focus of CG studies to include a rigorous explanation of the global CG phenomena and to provide effective solutions for the practitioners. Contribution to Impact: This study demonstrates the value of using a configurational analytical approach to explore both the firm and country-specific CG practices (together) that engage firms to achieve the desired level of performance across the corporate life cycles.

Research Summary: Boards are unlikely to be effective if they do not have sufficient collective expertise to understand, monitor, and address future risks. This begs the question, does the board, in fact, have this expertise? If not, can they reconfigure their expertise to address those risks? Building on agency theory, we analyze the alignment between the board's expertise and the firm's future risks, with the expectation that board composition will change over time to reflect the firm's future risks--strategic reconfiguration. Our results show that misalignment has negative implications for firm performance, misalignment also motivates appropriate board reconfiguration, and that this reconfiguration positively effects firm performance. Managerial Summary: Our study illustrates the need for board expertise to be aligned with firm risks. While there has been increasing pressure for firms to assess their directors' expertise (i.e., skill matrices), simply identifying expertise which is present or absent does not speak to whether that expertise is actually needed (or not) by the firm given the risks faced. We analyze boards' collective expertise, compare that with the risks that firms are facing, and identify the gaps which may detrimentally impact the monitoring ability of the board and cause firm performance to suffer. Consequently, understanding the degree of (mis)alignment is of paramount importance for boards to be effective monitors and positively influence firm performance. (c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

BACKGROUND: This paper examines the effects of a board's diversity on firm financial performance using a sample of 76 companies listed on FTSE100 over the period 2010-2015. This period reflects the years following the financial crisis of 2008 when mounting criticism emerged that weak corporate governance partly explained The Financial Crisis. It is suggested that the Board of Directors' composition may have played a pivotal role in the Crisis and that Boards that better reflect society perform better. OBJECTIVE: This research examines the impact of gender, age, nationality, and presence of independent directors on firm performance. METHODS: Data on board characteristics were collected from Hemscott, as well as information from the companies' annual reports and financial database FAME. Using the Generalized Method of Moments, the data were assessed to examine board diversity and firm financial performance. RESULTS: This study consists of 456 observations from 76 listed FTSE 100 companies during the period 2010-2015. Twenty-four companies were excluded due to missing data that related to directors' attributes after controlling for firm characteristics, board structure, and potential endogeneity issues, the findings support the business case for gender and nationality board diversity. However, no significant associations were found between firm financial performance and board age diversity or board independence. CONCLUSION: This study, although British based, joins a growing global body of evidence that more diverse boards improve firm performance. It is incumbent on practitioners, decision-makers, and politicians to educate and persuade firms' directors of the merits of more diverse boards. (c) 2021 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

The continuous escalation in cybersecurity risk and the frequency of operational IT failures have drawn attention to the importance of the board of directors' monitoring function and responsibility for maximizing IT value-protection. In response, boards have sought to enhance their IT competence levels. We assert that, while higher board IT competence has positive implications in IT value-creation, it could have a negative implication in the IT value-protection context. When firms have a more IT competent board, equity investors' ex-ante expectations of superior oversight of IT by the board are baked into those firms' equity prices. When such firms experience operational IT failures, investors would view their boards as relatively ineffective in IT oversight and adjust more sharply the ex-ante expectations built into equity prices. Using agency-theoretic arguments, we develop this reasoning into a hypothesis that board IT competence is negatively associated with firm market performance post operational IT failures. Our analysis of 107 operational IT failures in public U.S. firms provides support for this hypothesis, even after we address the potential endogeneity of board IT competence. (c) 2021

Corporate governance sits at the intersection of many disciplines, among them law, business, management, finance, and accounting. The point of departure for large portions of this literature concerns the ugliness of greed, ambition, misdemeanors, and malfeasance of corporations, their directors, and those actors who hold shares in them. This essay takes a rather different starting point. Drawing upon insights from a distant field, it uses the discussion of aesthetics in Dewey's treatise on art to ask what motivates directors to act in ways that constitute the attention and engagement that we associate with the effectiveness of boards. Using Dewey's thinking about aesthetic experience, this paper examines the experience of organization boards, both in the literature and in the personal experience of the author. These observations point to need to reflect on motivation when considering both the practice of corporate governance and the policy frameworks in which it operates. (c) 2020, The Author(s).

Scholars endorsing the embeddedness outlook call for directors' greater engagement in the strategic management process. In contrast, scholars endorsing the control outlook argue that directors should focus on fulfilling their fiduciary duty of supervising top executives. Based on the behavioral-agency theory, this paper outlines a conduct outlook on boards. Recognizing the benefits of directors' participation in the strategic management process, we hypothesize that it may boost directors' satisfaction with firm's performance, strategic planning, and strategy. This could lead to cognitive entrenchment and spur inertial tendencies. Structural equations modeling analysis of the data from a survey of 367 Canadian directors supports the hypotheses. These findings add knowledge to latest research on the advantages vs. disadvantages of activist boards. (c) 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

The chapter analyzes female involvement in medium-sized family businesses in Central Italy. The empirical analysis focuses on 233 firms over the period 2007-2014, to understand how female representation in corporate governance has evolved in recent years, and to pinpoint the factors tending to encourage/discourage female involvement in the board of directors. A descriptive analysis was conducted, enabling a fuller understanding of how female involvement in governance roles has evolved over the years. A regression analysis was performed to determine if and how specific governance characteristics - such as family ownership and generational stage - may have a bearing on the female presence on the board. The results confirm that female representation is favorably influenced by a strong family presence in the ownership of the business, while family firms under first-generation control exert a negative influence on female involvement.

We investigate the relationship between gender diversity on corporate boards and environmental performances of firms. Our central focus is the extent to which a country's economic status (developed, developing) can shape such a relationship. We find evidence that gender diversity is positively correlated to environmental performances of firms. Interestingly, this correlation is not only stronger in developing countries but also increasing in gender diversity. These findings have considerable importance in terms of policy. Promotion of gender diversity in developing countries, where abatement costs are the lowest, would improve global environmental quality in a costeffective way. This is best achieved through building institutions and strengthening them. The benefits of such policy go beyond developing countries frontiers, particularly when global environmental problems (pollution, global warming, ozone layer depletion, loss of biodiversity, etc.) are concerned. These benefits can be a leverage for an efficient implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) both as gender diversity stands as a goal by itself and also because it facilitates achieving other environmental-related SDGs.

This study aims at identifying the determinants of gender diversity and nationality diversity in the boards of Vietnamese listed firms. The data are hand-collected from 257 companies listed on the Ho Chi Minh stock exchange (HOSE) and 214 companies listed on the Ha Noi stock exchange (HNX) in the period 2015-2017. The main analyzing methods include Pooled OLS, REM, FEM, and GMM. The research results show that gender diversity is determined by three factors, industry, family firm, and board size. Concerning the determinants of nationality diversity of the board, there is evidence that firm size, foreign ownership, state ownership, and proportion of foreign sales predict the nationality diversity. Based on these results, some administrative implications are proposed to improve the structure of the board, including expanding business scale, promoting exports, limiting the increase in the number of members on the board of directors, reducing state ownership, and increasing foreign ownership.

The board of directors' diversity plays a crucial role in the firm's decision-making process, which includes risk management. This study proposes a multidimensional index to measure board diversity. We use the Standard and Poor's (S&P) 1500 between 1996 and 2013 to analyse the relationship between board diversity and credit risk. We find an inverse and significative relation between board diversity and credit risk, which means that diversity matters in credit risk, and more diversity leads to less credit risk.

Attracting the interest of investors and gaining capital during the initial public offering (IPO) is the most important task that a company faces while going public. Management board diversity is the tool that company use to signal their value. The aim of this study is to analyse the relation between the management board composition and the amount of capital gained by Polish non-financial companies going public on the Warsaw Stock Exchange over the period of 2006-2018. The results of multivariate regression analysis show that larger board size and higher level of board diversity in terms of age are statistically significant and are positively associated with the amount of capital raised in IPO by companies. Still, board gender diversity is not an important factor explaining IPO proceeds. Our study reveals that control variables such as company size and listing delay, but not profitability, are correlated with the dependent variable. Copyright (c) 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Purpose: Several empirical attempts have investigated boardroom processes and their impact on the governing team decision-making. Such attempts, however, have derived in inchoate results opening new methodological debates and leaving the underlying patterns of board processes obscure. This paper aims to shed light on these patterns by empirically examining the interrelation among the three central constructs involved in board decision-making: know-how, demographic diversity and directors' social interactions. Design/methodology/approach: A framework of interrelation among know-how, demographic diversity and social interactions was conceptually built and empirically validated with partial least squares structural equation modelling applied to archival data from a sample of 87 boards of directors of Spanish, German and UK listed companies. Findings: Results unmask the intricacies of behavioural processes involved in know-how-demography relation: demographic diversity contribution to know-how is totally and positively mediated by directors' social interactions. This reveals the power of directors' socialization frequency in determining processes and predicting know-how. Practical implications: The paper offers a new pathway to manage board know-how and to make board diversity effective. It also opens a door to an innovative empirical methodology to make board processes emerge, one that overcomes methodological limitations of previous efforts. Originality/value: This is so far the only study that examines and measures holistically the structural interrelation among the three central constructs determining board decisions and performance: know-how, diversity and social interactions.

Integrating theoretical perspectives on tokenism and perceived preferential selection, we explore whether the relationship between chief executive officers' (CEOs') external board memberships and CEO compensation is gendered. Based on recent pressures to diversify corporate boards, we theorize that female CEOs' memberships on external boards will result in less monetary compensation relative to male CEOs due to concerns of organizational decision-makers that female CEOs generally inhabit token or "symbolic" positions of limited value. Additionally, we present competing hypotheses (i.e., mitigation vs. exacerbation) regarding how this devaluation will be affected by female representation on the board of directors and compensation committee, respectively. Using a panel sample of 12,464 firm-year observations comprising of 1,805 unique firms and 2,782 unique CEOs, the relationship between CEO external board memberships and compensation is indeed weaker for female compared to male CEOs. Furthermore, this devaluation primarily occurred in organizations where there was stronger (vs. weaker) female representation on the board of directors or compensation committee. However, supplemental analyses revealed that this differential devaluation was mitigated when female executives on the board held greater power (i.e., chaired important committees), highlighting the importance of moving beyond mere representation to ensuring influence on boards for female directors.

This study investigates how firm structure, chief executive officer (CEO) power, and federal legislation influence hiring of corporate directors from a diverse background. Combining the value-in-diversity hypothesis and the similarity-attraction paradigm, we examine the impact of economically rational (i.e., business need) and social preference (i.e., similar-to-me bias) drivers of board diversity post-the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). Using a sample of S&P 1500 firms from an eight-year period spanning SOX, we find that SOX is positively correlated with board diversity. Although SOX was not intended to increase board diversity, the changes it put in place have subsequently facilitated more board diversity. Results show that the economically rational predictor (firm operational complexity) had a positive and statistically significant effect on board diversity pre-SOX but that effect disappeared post-SOX. Meanwhile, CEO power, a social preference inhibitor of board diversity, had a negative and statistically significant relationship with board diversity pre-SOX which also disappeared post-SOX. It appears that SOX has mitigated both economically rational drivers to want more diversity as well as social preference drivers to want less diversity. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed. (c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

The goal of corporate spin-offs, as a corporate restructuring technique, is to create better value for both the divesting firm and its subsidiary/division. These corporate transactions lead to the creation of independent, publicly traded entities, which are called spun-off subsidiaries. In this study, we examine the effect of board independence and directors' industry experience on the market performance of spun-off subsidiaries by setting two main hypotheses. Our sample includes 123 completed U.S.-based spin-off events during a 14-year long time frame. According to our empirical analysis, we find support for both hypotheses, which appear to be significant and positive. In addition, our moderation analysis shows that the interaction effect of directors' industry experience and board ownership is positive and significant. Based on the arguments of agency and resource dependence theories, this study contributes to the governance literature by proving the significant importance of board of directors (namely, their independence and industry experience) on the market performance of spun-off subsidiaries after being separated from their corporate parents. From the managerial contributions aspect, this study tells us that if the board is independent and includes directors with the same industry experience, these spun-off subsidiaries will experience positive change in their market performance. Our interaction effect also shows that if board members are offered more shares on the top of their industry experience, the change in market performance will be stronger.

Women director appointments on boards of public listed and/or licensed companies in Malta registered on the Malta Stock Exchange plc only account for 10.7% of all appointees. This is considerably less than the EU average of 33% for board members in STOXX Europe 600 Companies. This paper's main research objective is to assess the current situation in the appointment of women on these boards. Based on the similarity-attraction theory and resource dependency theory, the author investigated the process by which women are appointed on boards and elicited underlying reasons for this gender shortfall. Furthermore, current views on the adoption of gender quotas will be explored. The research methodology was based on a qualitative approach. Two research tools were adopted; the first, an online questionnaire submitted to women directors and the second, in-depth structured interviews conducted with chairpersons, the Maltese regulator, and Women Directors Malta. Thematic findings emerged indicating actual practices adopted by companies in considering women board appointments and shed light on the challenges in promoting gender diversity. The initial and informal process of appointing directors on these Boards was examined. The nomination committee plays a crucial role in identifying potential candidates. The current mode of board selection limits the pool of qualified women candidates. Boards need to cast a wider net in search of relevant skills sets. Women face significant career barriers and challenges to be appointed on Boards. It is claimed that women candidates do not always enjoy a 'high visibility' profile, and some argue that they seem to be under the radar. They may not be networking sufficiently in spheres of influence where the dynamics of boardroom politics pan out. Potential women candidates need to engage with networks that include influential powerbrokers. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of gender quotas as a corrective mechanism intended to address the under-representation of women on boards.

The supervisory role the board of directors is an essential corporate governance control mechanism, particularly in countries where external mechanisms are not well developed. The composition of the board based on gender can affect the quality of this supervisory role and thus the financial performance of the firm. While some national capital market regulators, such as UK, Germany and Australia, have introduced recommendations and disclosure requirements, other countries, such as Norway, Spain and France, have by legislation a minimum requirement of women's participation in a company's board of directors. While the matter of board gender diversity has captured researchers' attention in recent years, most empirical results use US data. The present paper attempts to contribute to the growing literature of non-US studies investigating the link between gender diversity in the board and firm financial performance by focusing on the UK. We use panel data analysis and find that gender diversity--as measured by the percentage of women on the board and according to two indices--has a positive effect on firm value. That means that it is the balance between women and men that UK companies should focus on instead of merely the presence of women since the latter alone does not have any impact on firm performance. Our study also suggests that investors in the UK do not penalize firms which increase their female board membership and that greater gender diversity can generate economic gains.

This study examines whether socially responsible firms carry higher research and development (R&D) intensity and how corporate governance quality influences this investment. Based on a sample of French firms belonging to the SBF 120 index from 2012 to 2016, the results show that firms with higher corporate social and environmental responsibility (CSER) score have greater R&D intensity. These companies try to protect environment and to create positive social impact by the use of new technologies. Moreover, the findings confirm that firms with better corporate governance quality invest more on R&D. Finally, the results reveal that some control variables influence significantly R&D intensity. The findings in this research may be of practical interest to investors, sustainable professionals and modern consumers who are aware of social and environmental concerns and who are trying to keep themselves informed about strategies used by businesses to improve CSER practices.

This article investigates how the board diversity affects firms' carbon emissions reduction and whether environmental innovation moderates this relationship. In addition, the moderating effect of environmental innovation in carbon-intensive versus non-carbon-intensive industries is also examined. Using data of the companies listed on the Standards & Poor's 500 index from 2002 to 2018, the 2SLS regression results indicate a statistically significant negative relationship between board gender diversity and carbon emissions. Environmental innovation amplifies the extent of this relationship. We find evidence that the moderation effect of environmental innovation is more pronounced for carbon-intensive firms than non-carbon-intensive firms. Our findings reinforce various corporate governance initiatives and public policy being undertaken all over the globe to encourage more gender diversity in the board of directors, demonstrating that board diversity enhances better board effectiveness in satisfying the needs of broader groups of stakeholders' interests. The findings could be beneficial for stakeholders and regulators concerned with improving corporate governance mechanisms as well as reducing the carbon footprint. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: Recent regulatory changes in Europe have promoted non-financial reporting practices (e.g., Directive, 2014/95/EU) and gender diversity in decision-making positions. Special attention is devoted to promoting the gender balance on corporate boards as a key mechanism to enhance corporate governance effectiveness and better address multiple stakeholders' needs. With this in mind, this study intends to examine the impact of boardroom gender diversity on Environmental Social Governance (ESG) disclosure practices in the European listed firms' context. Design/methodology/approach: The study applies different panel data models on an extended sample of 1,392 firms from 21 European Union (EU) countries for six years (2014-2019). Findings: Findings allow to spotlight the positive role exerted by the presence of women directors on the boards in enhancing ESG disclosure, both at the overall and specific (individual ESG scores) level. Research limitations/implications: Policymakers and regulators might consider the study's evidence as a stimulus to continue in promoting strategic actions and reforms that foster gender equality and balance in corporate decision-making positions. Practical implications: Creating a heterogeneous and diversified board of directors may support implementing a "sustainable corporate governance" recently claimed by the EC. Originality/value: The study contributes to the literature by disentangling the links between gender diversity and ESG disclosure over a period that covers a long season of European regulations and measures that affected both non-financial reporting practices and the board of directors' composition. Accordingly, it can contribute to enhancing the practical and theoretical understanding of the pivotal role that gender diversity may exert in strengthening corporate governance and, in turn, corporate transparency and accountability behaviours about non-financial issues.

We examine how gender diversity on boards of directors affects investment in research and development (R&D), thereby providing the platform for future ambidexterity of the organization. Using quantitative data from 44 countries, that are exemplified by qualitative data, our findings show that gender diverse boards result in more complex organizational outcomes in regard to R&D investment than assumed originally. Our findings show that gender diverse boards encourage ambidexterity. On the one hand, increased gender diversity has a negative direct effect on R&D. However by positively affecting equity based remuneration, these diversified boards actually encourage indirectly higher R&D investments that are better correlated with the organization goals. Gender diversity on boards, therefore, encourages organizational behavior that increases the chances for higher ambidexterity over time by encouraging exploitative behavior as well as explorative behavior.

Given the mixed evidence that having both women and men in the top management team (TMT) or in the board of directors (BOD) has a significant influence on organizational innovation, we resolve this issue by conceptualizing TMT-BOD gender diversity as part of a multiteam system, that has joint effects which impact organizational innovation. Evidence from the study of both Chinese firms and UK firms confirm our conceptualization by showing an interaction effect between TMT gender diversity and BOD gender diversity such that innovation is greatest when both are high. The positive TMT-BOD gender diversity interaction effect on innovation improves subsequent firm performance particularly in dynamic environments. The findings refine current thinking by going beyond research that tests intra-team TMT or BOD diversity independently and instead considers inter-team diversity across both leadership teams within the strategic leadership upper echelons. In sum, findings show that high levels of TMT and BOD gender diversity result in more organizational innovation, which ultimately improves firm performance. We offer implications for women's inclusion in leadership as well as for research on the upper echelons. (c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Purpose: This study aims to examine the impact of corporate governance attributes, in the form of board characteristics, on risk disclosures provided through integrated reporting (IR). Design/methodology/approach: Drawing upon an agency theory perspective, this study examines the effect of the main corporate governance board characteristics (size, gender diversity, independence and meeting frequency) on the level of risk disclosure provided by a sample of 95 IR adopters from 24 countries for 2018. Findings: The results suggest that firms are slow to realise IR's potential to produce innovations in risk disclosure mechanisms. In addition, certain board characteristics, such as gender diversity, independence of directors and meeting frequency, are positive drivers of the risk disclosure provided via IR. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on risk disclosure provided via IR. Connecting corporate governance mechanisms to IR risk disclosure practices can contribute to enhancing the practical and theoretical understanding of the role that the board of directors may play in stimulating transparency and accountability about risks via an alternative communication tool, IR, to the benefit of both investors and other stakeholders.

Of all actors involved in managing an organizational crisis, strategic leaders play a particularly central role. However, the growing scholarship on the impact of strategic leaders in crisis situations is characterized by a high degree of fragmentation, considerably hindering the generation of parsimonious theory and practically useful insights. To address this issue, we conduct a systematic multidisciplinary literature review that spans the research streams on strategic leadership and organizational crises. For each type of strategic leader--Chief Executive Officer (CEO), top management team, and board of directors--we identify the different applied theoretical lenses and highlight commonalities and differences between studies and their insights. We use our review to derive an integrative conceptual framework that guides future research. Our exploratory review unveils that, while each type of strategic leader plays a significant role in a crisis context, the perspectives taken and the resulting evidence vary: as for the CEO, research focuses on social evaluations--for instance, based on the CEO's appearance--as well as agency-theoretic considerations--particularly, financial incentives. Regarding the top management team, research mostly adopts a managerial and organizational cognition lens, focusing on characteristics such as personality and human capital. Lastly, for the board of directors, agency-theoretic considerations again dominate the scholarly conversation, especially studies of board independence. Overall, we review and organize a rich but patchy research landscape, and we derive ample opportunities for novel theoretical and empirical inquiries into strategic leaders and their role in managing organizational crises.

This exploratory qualitative inquiry examines the perspectives of 26 board members in medium-sized, privately held companies operating in the United Kingdom. The study question investigates how digital technologies (DT) are impacting on board director capabilities. Different board members' experiences from their own perspectives are examined, with attention on capturing the influence of digital technologies on the way that board directors work. Thematic analysis offers a rigorous approach to analysis and enables articulating deeper and meaningful understandings of individual director experiences. Findings presented as a framework, indicate that DT impacts all board directors' capabilities as four major aspects: gathering, interpreting and sharing information; board stewardship; blue-sky strategizing; and scoping predictive strategic priorities. Theoretical contribution is to Resource Dependence Theory (RDT) as an outcome-focused lens, which best explains a firm's interest in digital technological advantage through board contribution and outcomes. In conclusion, practical insights for board members and regulators are highlighted. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: This paper is an empirical study of the effect of the characteristics of the Sharia supervisory board (SSB) on the financial performance of Islamic banks. Design/methodology/approach: Using 42 Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Islamic banks outside the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and non-Islamic countries during the 2011/2018 period, a random-effects generalized lease square method for the regression analyzes is applied. Findings: The obtained results show that the characteristics of the SSB affect the financial performance of Islamic banks. The results also affirm that a large-sized board of directors and the number of SSB meetings improve banking performance while the cross-mandate seems to destroy it. On the other hand, the SSB members' competence and reputation and the proportion of women sitting in SSB have no impact on the financial performance of Islamic banks. Research limitations/implications: This paper gives a comprehensive literature survey on the effect of the characteristics of the SSB on the financial performance of Islamic banks. Practical implications: This study offers insights into the practitioner and Islamic banking regulators interested in enhancing the legitimacy of corporate governance in Islamic financial institutions. Originality/value: This paper is among the few studies that investigate the effect of the characteristics of SSB on the financial performance of Islamic banks in particular in Islamic banks in the MENA region outside the GCC and in non-Islamic countries.

CEOs, boards of directors, and owners are believed to be important actors in affecting environmental innovation. Yet, there is a lack of combined view on the three actors in the literature. This study aims to explore the sources of environmental innovation from the perspective of corporate governance bundles. Considering the interdependent nature of the three, this study proposes a configurational model consisting of CEO (formal and informal) power, board capital (breadth and depth), and ownership (institutional and insider). We undertake a qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) on a sample of 250 dirty firms and discover six sufficient configurations for high environmental innovation. These configurations suggest that there are multiple paths for achieving high environmental innovation. Furthermore, both powerful and weak CEOs can be environmental innovation facilitators if they are accompanied by suitable board archetypes and ownership structure. (c) 2022 The Authors

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relation between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and firm financial performance, and how audit quality moderates this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses panel dataset of 200 French firms listed during 2007-2018 period. The direct and moderating effects were tested by using multiple regression technique. Findings: The authors find that CSR has a positive impact on firm financial performance proxy with return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and Tobin's Q (TQ), suggesting that investment in social activities helps firms to achieve better financial results. The authors also find that the improvement effect of CSR on corporate financial performance is more pronounced for firms audited by Big 4 auditors. Research limitations/implications: One limit of this study is the selection of independent variables. We are limited to one variable, namely CSR engagement. Further studies may consider other independent variables, such as the age of the company, the type of industry, the composition of the board of directors, etc., in order to provide an in-depth analysis of corporate financial performance drivers. Practical implications: The findings have practical implications that may be useful to managers in their management of the firm. They encourage all board members to seriously weigh investing in developing strategies that promote the social behavior components in order to improve overall corporate performance. Originality/value: The research adds to the current literature on CSR by revealing the impact of external auditor quality on the CSR-financial performance relationship. In addition, it investigates not only the overall CSR ratings but also each of CSR dimensions, namely environmental, social and governance. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study examines whether the board of directors' compensation schemes affect stock market valuations for banks in a dual banking system (Islamic and conventional banks). We employ an international sample of 11 countries for the period 2010-2015. Our results show that for the full sample (i.e. irrespective of the bank type), board of directors' compensation has a significant and positive impact on stock market valuations. For different bank types, we find that the positive effect of the board of directors' compensation on market valuations holds only for conventional banks, with insignificant evidence for their Islamic counterparts. We, also, examine the impact of Shari'ah supervisory board's compensation on Islamic banks value. Our results show that investors positively perceived and priced information related to this boards' compensation. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the indirect relationship between board gender diversity and capital structure decisions and to examine whether the capital structure is affected by the type of approach used to promote women's participation in the boardroom. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of French non-financial listed companies over the period 2006-2019, this paper uses structural equations modeling, difference-in-differences using propensity score matching and chow test to highlight these effects. Findings: This paper finds that the relationship between the board gender diversity and the capital structure is mediated through the information transparency channel and firm risk taking channel. Furthermore, the results show that the effect of board gender diversity on capital structure decisions varies through the approach adopted (voluntary, enabling or coercive). Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature in several ways. First, the study is to the knowledge the first to examine whether and how board gender diversity affects capital structure decisions through two mediations channels, namely, the information transparency and the firm risk taking. Second, the study is one of the first to examine whether the capital structure is affected by the type of approach used to promote women's participation in the boardroom: coercive, enabling or voluntary approach.

We examine the relationship between board of director committees tasked with risk management and environmental performance, based on a sample of 1466 firm-year observations from 2007 to 2015. We find that the presence of board committees dedicated only to risk management is associated with better environmental performance. The human capital of risk committees (measured by board tenure, committee tenure, experience, and qualifications) is also positively related to environmental performance. Our findings suggest that the benefits of risk management committees extend to non-financial matters, such as environmental performance. Our findings further suggest that environmental performance is now managed through the regular governance mechanisms within firms. This supports the notion that environmental performance is managed for economic reasons and for the benefit of investors, rather than for the aggrandisement of individual managers. Our findings should be of interest to boards, CEOs, and CFOs who are interested in risk management, as well as to investors, lenders, and auditors who are interested in assessing risk.

This study extends research on the board nationality and gender diversity to a new, unchartered, methodological territory of qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). QCA is based on Boolean algebra and facilitates the application of set-theoretic reasoning to the data analysis. This work adds to the repository of academic studies, which put forward a 'business case' for the board nationality and gender diversity in terms of their positive impact on the board outcomes. Based on the upper echelons theory and the 'value-in-diversity' proposition, we assess the influence of board nationality and gender diversity on board commitment, which is measured with two proxies: the annual number of board meetings and board evaluation. The findings indicate that both board nationality and gender diversity are part of the intermediate solutions for the outcome variable. The impact of both variables on board commitment is typically detected in large firms that are internationalised but not product-diversified, the boards of which tend to be small. These results confirm that the increasing emphasis on ensuring significant board nationality/ethnic and gender diversity in board composition within the regulatory documents on corporate governance represents a step in the right direction.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the direct and indirect relationship between board gender diversity and corporate tax avoidance using corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a mediating variable. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a panel dataset of 200 French firms listed during 2007-2018 period. The direct and indirect effects between board gender diversity (BGD) and tax avoidance were tested by using structural equation model analysis. Findings: The results indicate that the presence of women on corporate boardrooms negatively affects tax avoidance. The greater the proportion of women in boards, the lower the likelihood of tax avoidance practice. In the mediation test, CSR appears to partially mediate the link between women on boards and corporate tax avoidance. Additional analysis shows that the social dimension of CSR produces this mediating effect. Practical implications: The results have practical implications for companies in regulating the composition of their boards. To benefit from diversity, firms have to increase women's percentage in their boards of directors. Also, investors are encouraged to pay attention to the percentage of female directors when investing and purchasing shares. Social implications: This study proved empirically that the higher proportion of female directors significantly reduces the possibility of tax avoidance either directly or indirectly through enhancing CSR performance. The findings show that firms with gender diversified boards are more likely to get involved in CSR for hedging against the potential consequences of aggressive tax avoidance practices. In light of the above results, firms are well-advised to strongly apply the policy encouraging or mandating women as board members to take advantage of their expected benefits. Originality/value: The originality of this paper consists in proposing the establishment of both direct and indirect relationships between BGD and corporate tax avoidance through CSR. Unlike prior studies that have been examining the direct relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and corporate tax avoidance, this study went further to investigate the indirect relationship between these two constructs. This study also differs from prior studies as it examines the effect of BGD on each of constituting pillars of CSR, namely, environmental, social and governance. To date, an extensive part of CSR research has used the combined score of CSR, but the effects on different CSR pillars remain little investigated. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Cyber risk has become one of the greatest threats to firms in recent years. Accordingly, boards of directors must be continually vigilant about this danger. They have a duty to ensure that the companies adopt appropriate cybersecurity measures to manage the risk of cyber fraud. Boards should also ensure that the firm disclose material cyber risk and breaches. We examine how the board's gender composition can influence the extent of such disclosure, based on a sample of the companies listed on the S&P/TSX 60 Index over the period 2014-2018. Results show evidence of a positive association between the presence and level of cybersecurity disclosure and board gender diversity. However, the board must boast a critical mass of at least three women before this positive impact can be observed. Our findings contribute to the debate on the importance of gender diversity by adding the concept of the positive influence of heterogeneity on cyber disclosure. We also augment the literature on the critical mass of women in boardrooms by providing empirical evidence that three or more women constitute the threshold for better governance. Our study has important implications for investors, stakeholders and regulators. If investors wish to increase cybersecurity disclosure, they should ask for more diversified boards. Our findings support regulators in their efforts to increase women's representation on boards by providing empirical evidence of better outcomes with this type of board composition.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to shed light an important limit of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) in pursuit of its substantial purpose, which is to achieve sustainability and contribute to achieving the objectives of United Nation (UN) Agenda 2030; the paper also suggests how to overcome those limits. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a survey of board members of listed and un-listed Italian companies. Data were analysed using an ordered probit model. Findings: The results show that a greater involvement of a board member in the non-financial reporting process is associated with a stronger commitment towards sustainable development. Specifically, the involvement in materiality assessment is positively associated with more proactive behaviours towards sustainability. Research limitations/implications: The use of self-reported assessments on beliefs and behaviours and the application of an online survey are methodology limitations of the study. Regarding theory, the study contributes to the literature on corporate governance and sustainability, integrating upper echelons theory, which focuses on how individual attributes influence a firm's strategies and governance, with research on how leadership practices can have a positive impact on corporate sustainability goals. Practical implications: The paper underscores the opportunity for policymakers to increase the effectiveness of the NFRD through deeper involvement of the board members in the process of non-financial reporting. The results could also be of interest to governance bodies in terms of defining a board's tasks and practices to encourage the adoption of behaviours oriented towards a stronger engagement in sustainable issues. Originality/value: This is the first study to provide evidence of the relationship between individual directors' tasks and behaviours, non-financial reporting and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study highlights some of the limits of the NFRD, even after the public consultation to revise it, and suggests how to overcome these limits. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We examine the effect of dual board governance mechanisms (Shariah supervisory board and regular board of directors) on Islamic banks' liquidity creation. We also investigate whether managerial ability is a channel through which such governance mechanisms influence liquidity creation. Using data for 110 Islamic and conventional banks from 11 countries for the period of 2005-2015, we find that better Shariah supervisory board (SSB) governance increases on-balance sheet liquidity creation but decreases off-balance sheet liquidity creation. This result is robust to an analysis of subsamples, to individual governance attributes, to interactions of dual governance mechanisms, and when controlling for endogeneity issues. Our results reveal that both SSBs and regular boards of directors affect liquidity creation by enhancing managerial ability. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

This paper provides a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of existing international accounting and finance research on the structure, characteristics, and diversity of corporate boards (SCDBs), as well as their effects on the corresponding corporate outcomes. Emphasis is particularly placed on synthesising and expanding current knowledge from both theoretical (i.e., economic and governance, regulatory, resource-oriented, and psychological/sociological) and empirical (i.e., multi-level antecedents of SCDBs and various themes of SCDB-related corporate outcomes) perspectives. Adopting the SLR method, we review 511 articles from 69 journals between the years 1973 and 2020. Our main findings are as follows. First, the majority of the papers in our SLR are descriptive in nature and/or use a single traditional theory (e.g., agency theory), rather than adopting an integrated multi-theoretical approach. Second, studies on the determinants or antecedents of SCDBs are scarce and have tended to focus on firm- and board-level issues rather than on institutional- and individual-level issues. Third, given the absence of cross-country, mixed-methods, and qualitative investigations, current articles in our SLR suffer from methodological constraints, such as inconsistent definition and measurement, insufficient variables, and repetitive quantitative research methods. Finally, opportunities and a future research agenda are explored and outlined. (c) 2022 The Authors

We examine the minutes of Indian banks' board meetings and offer insights into the issues tabled and discussed in bank boards. We find that risk issues account for only 10% of the issues tabled with regulation and compliance accounting for the most (41%), followed by business strategy (31%). Majority of the issues are not deliberated in detail. We interpret the evidence as suggestive of under-investment in risk and over-investment in regulation and compliance by bank boards. (c) 2022

Corporate governance has received substantial scholarly attention for decades, although the focus of this research has by and large been on publicly traded for-profit organizations. However, agency problems are increasingly recognized in nonprofits. As such, we examine the application of corporate governance logic in the context of nonprofits. Our study relies on nearly a decade of data spanning 6853 US-based charities and comprising nearly US$346 billion in total revenue. Our results show that common corporate governance practices--such as independent boards, chief executive officer oversight, and transparency--enhance the degree to which donor contributions are allocated toward a charity's mission. Overall, we assess the broader applicability and benefits of corporate governance and build on literature highlighting links between for-profit and nonprofit organizations. In doing so, we demonstrate the usefulness of governance in this economically and socially consequential context. (c) The Author(s) 2020.

This study contributes to the literature of women on boards of directors by showing how female board representation affects the board's involvement in the strategy of employment downsizing, and whether the downsizing strategy mediates female directors' influence on firm performance. We examine data of Taiwanese 1329 manufacturing firms over the 1996-2017 period and apply dynamic panel methods to deal with the endogeneity problems contained in the mediation model. Evidence on the gross effect of women on boards supports our contention that in Taiwanese socio-cultural context, the cognitive frames and human capital female directors bring to boards can improve the firms' accounting-based performance; however, investors' ingrained bias against women may dilute the positive impact and lead to unfavorable stock market reaction to the firms with female directors. Focusing on the indirect mediating effect, our results indicate that perhaps because female directors' leadership style and core values provide boards with more stakeholder-oriented perspectives, the firms with more women directors tend to implement less downsizing, and such talent-retaining strategy is beneficial to firm performance. This positive indirect effect is investors' bias-free, that is, women on boards can be leveraged for higher accounting returns and stock market valuation through their involvement in downsizing.

We examine the relationship between women directors and corporate social performance (CSP) by considering the contingency effects of home-country culture. Drawing on upper echelons and social role theories, we hypothesize that greater women representation on boards positively affects CSP due to their distinctive expertise, perspectives, and knowledge in this area, which strengthen their firms' attention and resources devoted to it. We then draw on the cultural perspective to explain how national culture moderates this relationship by shaping the salience of women directors' views and boards' openness to them. Based on data for 3175 firms across 38 countries between 2008 and 2015, our multilevel analysis provides support for most of our hypotheses. (c) 2022, Academy of International Business.

Drawing on the resource-based view, this study examines how board composition and board tasks affect the relationship between the firm's global focus and performance in private family firms. Based on a sample of 234 Belgian private family firms, our empirical analyses reveal that nonfamily involvement in the board attenuates the negative relationship between the firm's global focus and performance. Furthermore, our results show that the global focus-performance link turns positive at higher levels of board networking and advisory tasks, whereas board control task has no significant effect. Ultimately, these findings underscore the board of directors as a key governance contingency, highlighting its important role in overcoming the challenges of global expansion in private family firms.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential influence of internal and external corporate governance mechanisms on audit risk in Tunisian companies. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of Tunisian non-financial firms listed on the Tunisian Stock Exchange (TSE) over the periods 2005 to 2010 (pre- 2011 revolution) and 2011 to 2017 (post -2011 revolution), consisting of 371 observations for the whole period, the authors apply the generalized least square (GLS) to test the research hypotheses and model. Findings: The results are consistent with the agency theory suggesting that efficient corporate governance is able to control and reduce a company's agency problem. Evidence reveals that the effectiveness of the director's board/ownership structure and audit quality have the most influence on audit risk before than after the 2011 revolution, although governance mechanisms should play a more active role in encouraging companies to be more transparent in the post-revolution period. Moreover these findings are confirmed when identifying a composite measure of corporate governance. Practical implications: Significant implications are provided for analysts, investors, regulators and academics. First, findings can help Tunisian regulators determine corporate governance disclosure requirements. Second, this research will make investors and stakeholders aware of the fact that minimizing auditor risk will be effective in reducing agency problems in emerging markets like Tunisia. Then, this work can help researchers better understand and realize the corporate governance role in the quality of audit process and financial statements and encourage them to deeply and broadly investigate this issue on other emerging markets. Originality/value: This study stands for an extension of the existing research on corporate governance and audit risk. It fills a research gap in the local context. In fact, the considered data are those of the pre- and post-revolution Tunisian market, mainly in periods of instability. Although emerging markets make up the vast majority of economic activity around the world, they have received limited attention in academic research. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study investigates the board of directors' contribution to opportunity development in high-tech ventures. Based on the dynamic managerial capabilities perspective, we argue that more experienced boards will contribute more to opportunity development. Furthermore, building on the attention-based view, we argue that this effect will be moderated by structural and situational factors that affect board members' attention to the venture's opportunity development process. Using hand-collected data on 179 high-tech ventures in Belgium, we find that board experience has a stronger relationship with the board's contribution to opportunity development when board size decreases, when board tenure increases and when the venture underperforms. These findings offer a contribution to the literature on opportunity development in new ventures and to research on the boards of directors' role in new ventures. They also have important implications for entrepreneurs who are trying to develop opportunities and their stakeholders. Plain English summary While experienced board members have the potential to contribute to opportunity development in high-tech ventures, they often refrain from leveraging this experience due to the structure of the board and the situation of the venture. When high-tech ventures try to develop new opportunities, they mostly rely on the experience of the top management team. As this could limit the range of opportunities they see, bringing in experienced board members may seem a fruitful way of getting new information and a broader perspective. This study indeed shows that, in the context of high-tech ventures, more experienced boards can contribute more to opportunity development. However, even if board members have relevant experience, they are not always motivated to use this experience to the benefit of the venture. In fact, they are less likely to leverage their experience when boards are bigger in size, when board members have spent less time sitting together on the board, and when the venture performs better. The implication of this study is that high-tech ventures should be aware that board members can potentially contribute to opportunity development, but that their actual contribution depends on structural and situational factors that direct board members' attention to opportunity development.

Research on the outcomes of shareholder activism has gained momentum among management scholars in recent years. However, studies focusing on the way shareholder activists affect top managers' cognition are still in its infancy. Thus, this study examines the relationship between shareholder activism and chief executive officers' (CEOs') future focus on the basis of signaling theory. By applying a contingency view and considering various characteristics of proposals by activists as pivotal moderators, it intends to reveal the conditions under which activists stimulate CEOs' future focus. Empirical analyses not only confirm that shareholder activism shapes CEOs' future focus but also reveal that this effect is stronger when shareholder proposals are written in an analytical and powerful tone, contain more adverbs and verbs, and trigger CEOs' cognition by highlighting negativity. Conversely, more self-related proposals reduce activists' positive impact. Supplemental analyses indicate that the relationship between shareholder activism and CEOs' future focus may vary under the different characteristics of the boards of directors. Generally, the study provides an innovative and more 'humanized' perspective on the literature being among the first to examine the impact of shareholder activism on CEOs' future focus based on signaling theory. By exploring communication characteristics, the study also applies a relatively novel lens in management research. Moreover, it offers valuable practical implications for shareholders (proposals as effective means to increase interest alignment between shareholders and top-level executives), CEOs (proposals as an impetus to become more aware of future events), and boards of directors (proposals as an important governance tool).

Building on agency and resource dependence theories, we study the relationship between the value of initial public offerings and the extent of board independence, which we find to be an inverted U-shape: beyond a certain threshold, board independence becomes excessive. Consistent with agency theory, the inverted U-shaped relationship is more pronounced when ownership and control rights are separated. Consistent with resource dependence theory, the inverted U-shaped relationship is more pronounced in companies with higher industry diversification and less pronounced when the roles of the CEO and president of the board of directors are separated.

The boards of directors of state-owned enterprises and state institutions in South Korea is the subject of this research. These boards have not received significant attention in previous studies, despite their distinctive features and control role. The focus is on gender diversity with reference to task-related variables such as insider/outsider, tenure, and occupation. The extent of the board's monitoring was measured following the rates of revision and rejection of management plans in the board's minutes. The idea is to assess decision-making as a measure of the effectiveness of the boards. Based on longitudinal data on state-owned enterprises and state institutions in South Korea, gender diversity was positively associated with the extent of the board's monitoring. Understanding of the positive impact of gender diversity was enhanced with the inclusion of task-related diversity variables in the model. Tenure and occupation diversity were positively associated with the extent of the board's monitoring. It is proposed that the various diversity factors specific to organizational context be examined to improve understanding of diversity. (c) 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Purpose: This study investigates the relation between the board of directors' attributes and corporate social performance. The authors examine three board of directors: characteristics, size, independence and gender diversity, and how they interact with industry to affect corporate social performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a multivariate approach to analyze and compare the effects of governance variables on two aspects of corporate social performance, its environmental and social dimensions. Findings: Based on a sample of 983 firm-year observations, our main findings indicate that board independence, size and gender diversity each has a different impact on the environmental and social dimensions of performance, but that industrial sector moderates these effects. In particular, our results show that board member independence is positively associated with the environmental dimension of the performance of all the sample industries, but only has a positive association with the social dimension when the firms are in industries other than those that are environmentally sensitive. For these latter industries, board independence is negatively associated with the social dimension. Board size is positively associated with the environmental dimension for environmentally sensitive industries only and with the social dimension for all the industries examined, with a stronger positive effect on the latter in regard to environmentally sensitive industries. Research limitations/implications: Women directors appear to raise social and environmental concerns within the board, as evidenced by their positive effect on the firms' social and environmental performance, with a stronger impact on the former. Practical implications: Regulators can promote changes to the way Canadian companies select directors for the purpose of achieving sustainable performance while investors will be better informed about the impact of some of the board attributes on the environmental and social dimension of performance. Originality/value: This study provides a portrait of the impact of governance attributes on the environmental and social dimension of performance of Canadian companies. Given the increasing interest in gender diversity in recent years, this study provides new evidence on the benefits of female board members for the two non-financial dimensions of performance.

With the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in company activities, discussions on how to use AI in company management have emerged. Although AI is not legally recognised as a director in company law, there are examples of robot directors such as Vital, which have managed to get a seat in the corporate boardroom. Today, AI is on the verge of playing an important role in corporate governance. However, whether it has a seat on the board of directors or an important role in decision making is still a hot topic. Another critical discussion in the field of corporate governance in recent years is board diversity, which aims to improve the corporate decision-making process and create efficiency. This article attempts to anticipate the potential impact of AI on corporate board diversity policies and regulations. Therefore, this article seeks to examine the effects of the inevitable use of AI in the corporate decision-making process on corporate board gender diversity discussions and regulations under three possibilities: AI as a board member, AI as an enabler to assist a decision maker or AI being used to help decision making such as selecting board members.

Research that links boards in general and interlocks in particular with internationalization activities of emerging market multinationals (EMNEs) has recently garnered significant attention. However, a focused examination of the impact of the interlocks of different types of directors on the nature of EMNE internationalization strategy is missing. To address this gap, we use an integrated agency-resource dependence perspective to distinguish board interlocks provided by inside directors from those provided by independent directors to demonstrate their impact on exploratory and exploitative internationalization. We test our hypotheses on 1996 observations of Indian firms between 2011 and 2017. Our results show that while inside director interlocks promote exploitative strategies over exploratory internationalization strategies, independent director interlocks deter exploitative internationalization. Furthermore, these preferences are contingent upon the R&D intensity of the firm. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd

Firm leaders expect their chief marketing officers (CMOs) to have significant impact on firm performance, and boards of directors (boards) consider marketing-related issues critical board-level priorities. Despite the importance of marketers and marketing to firm outcomes, boards do not appear to value CMOs at the strategy-setting level of the firm as they rarely include CMOs in board discussions and deliberations. The disconnect between the importance of marketing and the marginalization of marketers at the board level prompts the following question: How and in what ways may boards impact CMO performance? This research includes two reviews of the extant literature (from 1984 through 2021): (1) board impact on CMOs, and (2) board impact on the satisfaction, performance, and outcomes of the broader top management team (TMT), including chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief operating officers, chief technology officers, and chief strategy officers. We find that only four articles investigate the impact of boards on any functional TMT member's performance and that none specifically consider how the board may impact CMO satisfaction, performance, and outcomes. Given the lack of research, we create a conceptual framework that links board characteristics to CMO outcomes and develop a research agenda with over 50 questions as the basis to develop scholarship. Importantly, this research highlights the paucity of insight regarding board-level influence on any functional TMT member, including the CMO. Consequently, the model and research agenda can benefit multiple disciplines including marketing, finance, information technology, operations, management, and human resources.

We investigate trends and determinants of board gender and age diversities using a sample of 8,590 firms for 20 years. Gender diversity and the average age of boards increased, while age diversity decreased in this period. We find that larger, older firms tend to have more gender diversity but less age diversity. More board independence is related to higher gender diversity, while more firm complexity is associated with less age diversity. For younger (older) boards, more female directors are associated with less (more) age diversity. We also find that female directors in older boards generate value for the firm. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

This research examines the impact of board gender diversity on CSR disclosure for Tunisian listed banks during the period 2012-2017. Data for CSR disclosure are collected using the content analysis of the annual reports of the banks. To measure the level of CSR disclosure, we used the grid adopted by Branco and Rodrigues (Corporate Communications: An International Journal 11:232-248, 2006, Journal of Business Ethics 83:685-701, 2008). The results show that board gender diversity affects positively the level of CSR disclosure. This implies that the female representation in the board of directors promotes CSR disclosure by listed Tunisian banks. Furthermore, the level of CSR disclosure is affected positively by the bank size and negatively by the directors independence. The paper contributes to the literature on best practices in corporate governance for financial institutions in emerging markets. The results have implications for banks and policy makers in Tunisia. For banks, it shows the relevance of female representation on boards of directors to meet the CSR reporting needs of the users of annual reports. Policy makers can enforce the presence of women in top management position and more specifically on the boards of directors when drafting corporate governance regulations.

This study provides an empirical investigation of the impact of Corporate Governance (CG) attributes on the environmental and social aspects of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The dependent variables considered for the description of the environmental and social aspects of CSR were determined using the Refinitiv approach, and through the lens of agency, stakeholder, and resource dependency theories. The independent variables were selected based on the literature and involve eight CG attributes, namely: CSR committee, CEO duality, board meeting attendance, board meetings frequency, non-executive board members, board gender diversity, board specific skills, and board experience. The employed methodology was evaluated through a sample of dependent and independent variable data of 313 companies across the European region excluding companies from the Eurozone for the period of 2006-2020. A suite of machine learning models was employed for capturing the most important determinants of the environmental and social aspects of CSR. The results reveal that three main corporate governance attributes may have a significant impact on a company's environmental and social performance. These attributes involve more female directors and directors with low board experience in board positions, and finally, the existence of CSR committees. The derived findings provide significant implications for corporate directors, socially responsible investors, policymakers, and regulators that intend to promote CSR initiatives and strategies.

There have recently been many calls to explore corporate governance in emerging economies, as these countries have distinctive characteristics such as a weaker institutional environment and the dominating influence of controlling shareholders. The literature has revealed that, in such institutional settings, there is the risk that powerful insiders maximize their own benefits at the expense of minorities and firm performance. This study advances our knowledge of corporate governance in emerging economies by exploring the moderating impact of quad-qualified directors - i.e., directors with independence, expertise, bandwidth, and motivation - on the relationship between dominant-owner CEOs and firm performance. We tested our hypotheses on a large cross-sectional sample of Indian listed firms. Our results show that dominant-owner CEOs undermine company performance, but quad-qualified directors may improve board monitoring and consequently attenuate their negative influence. Our findings support the soundness of the quad-qualified model for boards of directors, and contribute to the growing literature investigating which directors' attributes may have a significant impact on board monitoring and firm performance.

This study aims to identify the board of directors' characteristics affecting commercial banks' performance in Vietnam. The paper is based on the data collected over eleven years (2010-2020) for a set of 35 Vietnamese commercial banks listed on the stock market. The author explores the board of director characteristics affecting banks' performance in Vietnam on the platform of the quantitative regression method-System Generalised Method of Moments. The paper concludes that the statistically significant factors that involve the BOD<apos;>s characteristics affect banks' performance, namely board size, nationality diversity and board of directors' advanced education. The author also demonstrates the influence of ownership structures on those banks' performances. The results reveal that banks are owned and controlled by the government, and ownership concentration can improve and increase their performance. The author clarifies the role of the ownership concentration factor in the relationship to a bank<apos;>s performance. Significantly, commercial banks, which have their shareholders own over 5% of shares, namely institutions, the government, and members of the board of directors, can improve their performance because these shareholders have strict mechanisms to monitor and control the bank<apos;>s activities to minimize risks and increase the commercial bank<apos;>s performance.

In this article we investigate the effect of the presence of women on the board of directors and in executive positions on the risk and profitability of75 banks in ten ASEAN countries during the period of 2002-2018.We find that banks with more women in executive positions show higher capital risk, i.e., Z-score and capital ratio. However, the women-led banks have higher market to book ratios and they are more profitable in terms of return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). Furthermore, our findings shed light on the relationship between gender diversity and financial decision-making in the company by highlighting that the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) banks with more executives' women are more risky and have higher profits than the men-led banks. We also find that the proportion of women on the board standing as a director or a chair reduces performance in ROA and ROE. Bank performance measured by market-to-book (PB), is the lowest when there are females on the board. This highlights the gender differences in investment behavior and the women's needs in banks at Asian region. Given that bank performance has a direct effect on the stability of the financial system as well as on economic growth in the country, it is essential for the regulatory authorities to assess variety of sources which can improve performance and governance in (ASEAN) banks.

We study the dynamics of a major design choice in the governance of ventures: whether to distribute power at the top of the venture between a separate CEO and board chair. We propose that ventures are more likely to combine (separate) their CEO and chair positions when operational performance is poor (strong), demonstrating behavior in line with the threat rigidity thesis. Paradoxically, however, ventures would most benefit from a separate CEO and board chair when operational performance is poor. Empirical analysis of data from the Australian mining industry offers general support for our theory, with some interesting nuances. We discuss the implications of our findings for emerging conversations in the literatures on venture boards, boards of directors, and entrepreneurship. (c) 2022 The Authors

This paper explores the sociology of gender pay equality in leadership positions. Using a large compensation dataset, we examine the impact of gender pay inequality among directors and executives on firm performance. Based on a triangulation research design, quantitative outcomes are supplemented with semi-structured interviews to study compensation expectations, negotiation skills and gender differences in teamwork on boards of directors. The findings show that remuneration transparency is becoming the norm. However, compensation inequalities still exist and undermine performance. The results indicate that diversity targets or specific policies regarding equality and equity of opportunity are insufficient if they are not supported by a cultural understanding and the application of equitable policies and procedures throughout the organisation.

Purpose: Prior studies provide mixed evidence on the association of board busyness and firm productivity. Thus, this paper empirically analyzes how board busyness affects firm productivity. Design/methodology/approach: To measure board busyness, this paper computes the percentage of directors on a board who sit on three or more boards. Furthermore, to calculate firm productivity, the paper employs data envelopment analysis. Findings: Findings demonstrate that the association of board busyness and firm productivity (association) is generally negative and statistically significant but economically insignificant. In this respect, the findings reveal that the association is negative (positive) and both statistically and economically significant for firms having higher monitoring (advising) needs. Moreover, the findings demonstrate that regulatory oversight (1) weakens the general negative association; (2) changes the direction of association from negative to positive, for firms having higher monitoring needs; and (3) does not influence the association, for firms having higher advising needs. Originality/value: Taken together, the findings indicate that the association of board busyness and firm productivity is conditional to monitoring/advising needs and regulatory oversight. As such, the findings enrich the current debates on the association. Furthermore, the findings offer novel perspectives to enrich the regulatory frameworks of countries which are constraining multiple directorships. (c) 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Board director independence is critical to achieving and maintaining control to address the agency theory-based issue of interest misalignment between the principal (the organization) and the executives (agent). However, theoretical and empirical research and strategic risk considerations have brought into question the role or relevance that director independence plays in these control task and agency theory domains. We ask, using a quantitative survey method, whether board activity-based applications of independence may be associated with the service task of the board, namely its resource dependence mission. Our findings suggest that the resource dependence duty of the board may be positively associated with some autonomous activities, and yet other activities might be driven primarily by normative practices. Based on this, we suggest that a theoretical scope beyond and greater than agency theory may be needed when reassessing the role of director independence.

Purpose: This study aims to examine whether the age and tenure of the chair of the board of directors are related to research and development (R&D) investment in China. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses A-share manufacturing firms that traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange between 2009 and 2018. This study uses OLS regressions, controls for self-selection bias, and uses an instrumental variable to alleviate the concern of endogeneity. Findings: This study finds that chair tenure has a negative relationship with R&D investment. This study does not find a significant relationship between chair age and R&D investment. Originality/value: This study contributes to corporate governance and strategic management literature by highlighting chair tenure as a new factor affecting R&D investments. It also adds a significant contribution to the limited literature on the chair's role in strategic decisions. Moreover, companies that are eager to strengthen corporate governance and maintain sustained innovation may reconsider the chair tenure. Given that many proposals for board governance reform explicitly stress the importance of limiting board tenure, this study contributes to policymakers by providing evidence in support of these proposals.

Gender diversity on the board of directors can influence companies' voluntary disclosure such as their environmental, social and governance disclosure (ESG). A growing body of literature suggests that most of the work of the board occurs in committees, which are smaller working groups within the board. In a smaller working group, even a small number of women can represent a higher proportion of the group. Therefore, the influence of gender diversity on a board's decisions can be more prevalent in committees, since women's ideas and opinions can have more of an impact in smaller working groups. By being on committees, women have the chance to actively contribute to board tasks and decisions. This study investigates the relationship between the gender diversity of the board and its main committees and the ESG disclosure of Canadian-listed companies. The results indicate a positive and significant relationship between female representation on the board and committees and ESG disclosure. Using a structural equation model, the results suggest that there is a joint influence on ESG disclosure of gender diversity at the board level and at the committee. level. In addition, the study demonstrates that for ESG disclosure, the influence of female representation on committees is higher than the influence of female representation on the board. This study shows that by being on committees, women can better contribute to board decisions and that the influence of board gender diversity is not limited to female representation on the board but also comes from female representation on committees.

Many studies on the impact of boards of directors on corporate social responsibility have focused on the human capital of board members (i.e., structures and characteristics). However, the relational capital of board members (i.e., board interlock centrality) has yet to be fully explored. This study examines the extent to which board members are connected in their networks (i.e., board interlock centrality) on corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance in the restaurant industry. It also recognizes the moderating role of board effectiveness on the relationship between board centrality and CSR performance. On the basis of organization legitimacy theory and resource dependence theory, this study found that high-centrality boards increase positive CSR performance. The effect is more substantial when a firm has more standing board committees. The theories view firms as components of the larger social environment, and their performance depends on their ability to procure crucial resources from other firms through mutual exchange. No significant link was found between negative CSR performance and the moderating effect of board committees. (c) The Author(s) 2022.

The research subject focuses on gender diversity on boards and its impact on managerial performance and governance efficiency. Women presence on board can shed the light on cognitive and informational skills that can be beneficial for boards and the company itself. The literature review has elaborated determinants that deal with the research statement. A qualitative approach has been adopted. A semi-guided interview technique was adopted in order to seize seven women directors' perceptions. The data was treated was Nvivo software. The findings interpretation and discussion led for the establishment of five research propositions that centres on women contribution on managerial performance and governance efficiency.

This study examines the relationship between board political influence and corporate social responsibility (CSR) in Jordan. To achieve this objective, an index from 36-items was created by the researchers to measure the CSR activities of these companies. Using a panel dataset of 210 firm-year observations of industrial firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange over a four-year period (2014-2018), the findings showed significantly improved positive CSR activities by boards with greater political influence, also that implementation of CSR activities was strongly enhanced by external block holder presence on the board, whereas insider ownership showed mixed results and CEO ownership appeared negative; however, director ownership was highly positive and significant under both CSR measures. Furthermore, board independence had a negative impact on corporate CSR. The findings of the present study expand our understanding of the relationship between political influence and CSR activities, using various theories to explain particular theoretical associations.

Women's representation on corporate boards has recently drawn increasing attention. This study aims to investigate the moderator role of females on the board of directors on the relationship between earnings quality (EQ) and stock price informativeness. This research uses secondary data obtained from the Sahra database with the span of 158 active firms on the Tehran Stock Exchange from 2017 to 2021. Findings indicated that the presence of female directors on the board had a favorable impact on the correlation between EQ and pricing informativeness. That is, firms with more female board members have a greater association between EQ and stock price informativeness. The practical application of this research relates to female CEOs' monitoring roles, thereby enhancing the quality of financial reporting. (c) 2022, Institute of Economic Sciences.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the relationship between board demographic diversity and human rights reporting for a sample of large Western European companies. Design/methodology/approach: Grounded on resource dependence theory, the authors hypothesize that greater gender, age and nationality diversities will translate into enhanced levels of human rights reporting. The authors use ordinal logistic regression analysis to analyze the association between these types of board diversity and such reporting. Findings: The findings suggest that the companies in the sample attribute little importance to the reporting of information pertaining to the issue of human rights. They also suggest that only the diversity of nations represented in the board of directors is significant in explaining this type of reporting. Research limitations/implications: The sample includes only large companies from Western Europe and the analysis covers only one year. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study provides the first empirical analysis of factors influencing human rights reporting conducted on a multiple-country setting. It is also the first investigating the association between boards of directors' demographic diversity and such reporting.

In this study, I examine the effectiveness of a national board gender diversity disclosure requirement, which is, arguably, on the "soft" end of the continuum of boardroom interventions. Using a panel dataset of 1847 hand-collected corporate disclosures from 2015 to 2018, I perform a post-event, historical trend analysis of the efficacy of Canada's 2014 intervention. I find evidence of real progress in the 4 years following intervention against several benchmarks. Specifically, improvements in critical mass are documented, with the proportion of boards with three of more women reaching 18.8% in 2018. Tokenism remains an issue with very little change in the number of Canadian boards with only one woman. Further analyses using a sorting methodology and panel regression analysis reveal that progress toward board gender diversity is achieved by those with board gender targets, board seat renewal policies, and written board diversity policies. In addition, I find that larger companies achieve greater progress and that progress is clustered by industry. (c) 2022 W. Michael Hoffman Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University.

Recently, regulators and investors have shown an increasing interest in the promotion of diversity in the corporate boards of directors. In this paper, we employ data from the Australian bank boards to provide new insights on the diversity-risk nexus, based on a dataset of the Australian banks for the period of 2004 to 2019. We examine board gender diversity from two perspectives across the board and among board leaders. Our results support the context-dependent impact of gender diversity on the board of directors and highlight the beneficial impact on the risk of banks when considering gender diversity and the presence of a dominant gender group in the boardroom.

Research Summary: We investigate the relationship between outside board members (OBMs) and short- versus long-term strategic orientation of new ventures in the startup phase. Owing to their smallness and newness, a short-term orientation may be more desirable. Using a dataset of 170 Belgian new ventures in the startup phase, we find a positive association between the proportion of OBMs and a short- rather than long-term strategic orientation, attributed by our interviewees to concern for firm survival. This association is stronger in new ventures operating in highly competitive environments, and where the founding team performed few pre-startup activities. Greater focus on the short-term may be beneficial in the long run, as a positive association is found between a high relative short-term orientation and ventures' growth. Managerial Summary: New ventures in the startup phase should primarily focus on short-term issues: get a better understanding of who are the customers and try to validate the business model. This article reveals that the board of directors plays a pivotal role in influencing the extent to which startups have a short-term strategic orientation. Specifically, it explains how OBMs provide advice, monitor the startup's progress, and guide entrepreneurs on key short-term priorities. This strategic role of OBMs is more pronounced in new ventures where the entrepreneurial team is less prepared at founding and in firms operating in highly competitive environments. Importantly, our paper provides evidence that a short-term orientation in the startup phase does not jeopardize future venture growth in the scale-up phase. (c) 2022 Strategic Management Society.

Purpose: This study aims to evaluate changes in the presence of women on Spanish boards after the Unified Good Governance Code of Listed Companies (2006) and the Organic Law 3/2007 on Gender Equality, and this study compares the educational background of women and men directors. Also, this study analyses the influence of gender diversity and educational background of women directors on economic performance, corporate social responsibility (CSR) and, ultimately, firm value. In addition, this study explores the differences in board gender composition and its effect on firm value during the crisis and post-crisis periods. Finally, this study analyses the different influence of women directors depending on their typology. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a system of structural equations and a sample of 4,101 directors of 30 Spanish companies listed on IBEX-35 over 2008-2017. Findings: The results show that women's presence on boards has grown since 2008, and they have higher educational background than men. This study finds that women directors improve economic performance and CSR, though results are non-significant for firm value. Women directors with a bachelor's or master's degree increase economic and social performance but reduce firm value. Women directors with business or industry-related studies positively influence CSR but business specialisation negatively affects economic performance and firm value. Originality/value: This study analyses the direct and indirect effect of women directors on firm value, the influence of their educational background and the potential differences arising from the economic situation (crisis) and the type of board position they hold.

Purpose: The relationship between interlocking directorates and firm performance has been increasingly debated, with a focus on whether firm's centrality in interlock networks is associated with performance. The purpose of this study is to examine not only how a firm's position in this network is associated with performance but also how the performance of network partners can impact a firm's performance. This study examines how firms effectively utilise the interlock network to achieve the goal of higher market capitalisation - termed market capitalisation rank (MCR). Design/methodology/approach: The premise of the study is the UK FTSE 350 firms from 2014 to 2018. The paper makes use of a temporal network autocorrelation model to examine how firm characteristics, the structural position in the interlock network and the performance of network partners affect MCR over time. Findings: The analysis indicates that firms with ties (via the interlock network) to firms with high market capitalisation are more likely to enhance their own MCR, highlighting network partners have the opportunity to play a critical role in a firm's dominance strategy to optimise firm value. Originality/value: The value of this research is that it does not only look at the impact of a firm's position in the network on performance, but the impact of the performance of network partners on a firm's market performance as well.

This study examines the relationship between board gender diversity and R&D investments in the UK. Also, the study goes deeper and examines whether the relationship between board gender diversity and R&D investments is affected by the female tenure in the board. Using a sample from the UK FTSE350 index between 2009 and 2018, the findings show that board gender diversity has a positive impact on R&D intensity. Importantly, we find that this relationship is not affected by the tenure of female directors. Therefore, this result alleviates the concern that long female tenure might lead to weak monitoring, thereby adversely impacting the relationship between gender diversity and R&D investments. The findings hold after using different proxies for gender diversity and after controlling for endogeneity. The study injects the literature with up-to-date evidence on the role of female directors in R&D investment in the UK where female representation in the board is still optional. Moreover, the findings of this study contribute to the merits of the tense debate on female representation in the board of directors. In this regard, given that the current regulations in the UK recommend, but do not oblige, board gender diversity, regulatory bodies (e.g., FRC) could take this issue into consideration for future governance reform. Furthermore, companies that are eager to maintain sustained innovation should pay close attention to gender diversity during the process of the directors' appointment. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

Following its 40th anniversary and more than three decades after its introduction to the strategic management literature, agency theory remains the predominant theory of corporate governance. In this paper, we examine affect, an underexplored dimension in principal-agent relationships. Using the CEO-board of directors relationship as a context, we develop a theoretical lens that explains how interpersonal affect underlying relationships between CEOs and directors of boards shapes behavior in ways that deviate from traditional agency theory predictions. We discuss how the incorporation of an affective perspective advances principal-agent research by revising agency theory's assumptions concerning human nature and behavior and suggesting new research directions. By acknowledging a central role of affect, we connect existing behavioral approaches to organizational agency and advance our understanding of socioemotional foundations of principal-agent tensions, problems, and agency costs.

This chapter investigates the role of board of directors in corporate philanthropic activities, a strand of corporate social responsibility. We find that independent boards, female directors, and directors' ownership compensation tend to increase the incidence and level of corporate charitable giving. However, the presence of business experts on the board reduces the probability and the level of charitable giving. We also find that CEO power and bonus plan reduce the propensity of companies to donate to charitable causes but have no effect on the amount donated. Yet CEO ownership tends to be positively related to charitable contributions. CEO tenure, on the other hand, positively affects corporate decisions to contribute to charitable causes as well as the extent of such CSR investment. CEO age and expertise do not exert any influence on the decision to make corporate charitable giving. However, older CEOs negatively affect amount donated. Overall, findings indicate corporate governance quality and CSR-contingent compensation contracts as a way of increasing corporate philanthropy.

Boards of directors play a central role in governing corporate strategic change. We systematically review corporate governance research on strategic change published over the past 40 years, differentiating between strategic change types and board characteristics. We identify three developments: a focus on specific strategic change types, board composition and structure, and North American listed firms as a dominant study context. Yet, our analysis of the literature shows that research on board governance of interrelated strategic changes, on different board roles and behaviour, and on the governance of strategic changes across different contexts remains underdeveloped. To address these research gaps, we suggest three future research avenues: (1) examining how boards govern interrelated changes in a strategic change portfolio and its evolution over time; (2) studying the mediating relationship between board governance (particularly different board roles and behaviour), strategic changes, and corresponding outcomes; and (3) gaining a better understanding of the role of context in board governance of interrelated strategic changes. We contribute to corporate governance research by developing a framework that synthesizes extant research on the relationships between different board governance variables and strategic change types, highlights important research gaps, and outlines several future research directions to address these gaps. Our framework and literature overview serve as analytical tools to examine whether boards are well-designed and prepared to govern multiple and interrelated strategic changes. (c) 2022 The Authors.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of firm financial and operational characteristics on the level of forward-looking information disclosure (FLID) by Egyptian-listed non-financial companies. The present research also aims to investigate the moderating role of gender diversity on the board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: The sample incorporates the non-financial companies included in the EGX 100 of the Egyptian Stock Exchange (ESE), whose reports were available during the study period from 2013 to 2018. The final sample comprises 49 companies with 294 observations. Statistical analysis is performed using multiple regression analysis. Findings: This study found a significant positive impact of return on assets, leverage, company size and age on the level FLID, while external audit firm type and industry were found to impact the level of FLID negatively. Further, the board gender diversity (BGD) is found to have a moderating impact as it strengthens the effect of financial and operational characteristics on the level of FLID. Practical implications: The present study has some implications for Egyptian companies, investors in the Egyptian market and regulators in emerging economies, which include paying more attention to BGD when selecting the board members by companies as well as following up the female representation in all the listed companies by regulators. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the moderating role of BGD and its impact on the level of FLID in emerging markets. This extends the disclosure literature as the present study brings new evidence from an emerging market regarding BGD moderating role as early research concentrated on the direct impact of BGD on the level of FLID.

Purpose: The authors examine whether internal corporate governance mechanisms are effective in curbing cash flow manipulation through real activities, misclassification, and timing. Design/methodology/approach: The sample comprises of firms from an emerging market, India with data for years 2004 through 2015. The authors use the methodology given in Roychowdhury (2006). Findings: The authors find that corporate boards in India play an active role in curbing cash flow manipulation through real activities but fail to control cash flow manipulation through misclassification and timing. Practical implications: The study suggests that corporate boards should pay more attention to the reported cash flow numbers. Regulators can reduce the opportunities available for cash flow misclassification by fixing relevant accounting and governance norms. Auditors can also help by critically focusing on the cash flow classifications presented by management. Originality/value: This study, to the authors' knowledge, is the first study that talks about the role of internal governance in a trade-off between different cash flow manipulation techniques.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted nearly every boardroom in the world. However, neither the extant leadership literature nor the corporate governance literature offers succinct guidance on what constitutes effective board leadership during such a calamity. To address this theoretical and practical need, we develop a moderated mediation model, in which directive leadership from the board chair promotes competitive simplification at the onset of the crisis, which in turn promotes firm financial performance during the crisis. Using survey responses from 120 directors of U.S. public firms in Spring of 2020, combined with firm-level archival data from multiple sources and time periods, we find support for this mediated relationship--but only if the chair is not CEO. If the chair is CEO, we find no evidence of a positive relationship between directive leadership and either competitive simplification or firm financial performance; rather, we find some evidence of a negative relationship. We explore the implications of these findings for the theory and practice of corporate governance and crisis management. (c) The Author(s) 2022.

This study aimed at identifying the effect of board size and board gender diversity on dividend payout and identifying the role of return on assets (ROA) in moderating the effect of size and board gender diversity on dividend payout. The study population consisted of (45) service shareholding companies listed in Amman Stock Exchange (ASE), during the period (2009-2018), using balanced panel data of (36) service companies with (360) observations. The results indicate that the level of female representation in the boards of service companies in Jordan is still low compared to other countries. The results also showed that board size and board gender diversity affect dividend payout. In addition, the return on assets moderates the effect of board size on dividend payout. The results also showed that the return on assets does not moderate the effect of board gender diversity on dividend payout. The study recommends that regulatory bodies should take a step towards encouraging gender diversity in boards to enhance board of directors' effectiveness, through amending legislations that regulate female participation in boards, such as the Jordanian Corporate Governance Code.

This study explores the impact of legal protection level and board characteristics on the structure and the pay-performance sensitivity of CEO compensation. To reach the declared goals, this paper is supported by Mann-Whitney test. Data from 12 European countries for the 2016-2018 period reveals a significant impact of the legal protection level, CEO duality, board size, board independence and the presence of efficient compensation committee have a significant impact on the structure of CEO compensation but not on the pay-performance sensitivity of CEO compensation. In addition, the results show that the presence of women on board of directors has a positive impact on CEO's compensation. Present study contributes to literature in the fields of gender study and corporate governance of the firms. Also, present research has several managerial implications, highlighting the impact of legal protection and board characteristics on CEO compensation. Copyright (c) 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Innovation is a key factor for firms' competitive advantage in the long-term and for their financial success. Scholars highlight the underinvestment problem with respect of R&D investment. This chapter focuses on two relevant variables of corporate governance that influence firms' innovation performance: firm ownership and board of directors. In the first section, the effect of ownership structure on R&D investment is analyzed. More specifically, the chapter will illustrate the effects of family ownership and institutional ownership on innovation investments. The second section explores the main theoretical perspectives investigating the functions of board of directors and the main board tasks. Lastly, three attributes of board structure and their effect on R&D investments are explored. (c) 2022 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.

Despite the increase in the number of studies analysing innovation in family firms over the last decade, there are still a number of critical issues that are far from being resolved. One of these issues is related to the influence of women's presence in corporate governance structures on firms' innovation outcomes. In light of this, the aim of the present chapter is to investigate whether the inclusion of women in private family firms' corporate governance structures, namely, in the general shareholders' meeting, the top management team and board of directors, influences firms' innovation. By applying regression analyses to a sample of 339 Spanish private family firms, the findings reveal that the presence of women in general shareholders' meetings and in top management teams has a negative and significant effect on innovation.

Employee share ownership offers the workforce an opportunity to participate in the growth of their company via two mechanisms: profit sharing and power sharing. Profit sharing has been widely studied in the academic literature. Power sharing, on the other hand, has received little attention--notably in the form of the presence of a director representing the interests of employees who own shares on governance bodies. We study 10 French companies with employee shareholder representation on governance bodies, and our findings reveal the dual nature of the role. On the one hand, the participation of employee shareholders in governance bodies seems to have an influence on the disciplinary, partnership, cognitive and behavioural levels. On the other hand, it can be a source of entrenchment, as tensions that are specific to this little-known mandate reflect tensions within the company itself.

This chapter provides readers some theoretical connections between board busyness and stability of banks. As such, some knowledge about the busyness of the board of directors in the dual banking system (i.e., Islamic versus Conventional banks) will be discussed. This will be followed by the theoretical linkage between Shari'ah governance busyness and banking outcomes. Next, researchers and students will be introduced to some empirical evidence in this field, so that they can better visualise how the theoretical link between board busyness and bank outcomes was empirically examined in academics. Interestingly, this chapter provides researchers and students some good directions for endogeneity problems existing in corporate governance and board busyness research and some suggested methodology that could address such issues.

The objective of this study is to examine the role that the specialized committees, created within the board of directors, and the auditor play in relation to the hiring of a non-financial information assurance service and in relation to the choices of the assurance provider for such non-financial information. Specifically, this study analyses the effect of the independence and specialisation of the audit committee, the existence of a CSR committee, and the reputation of the financial auditor associated with its classification as Big4. The results indicate that those responsible for financial information do not show interest in contracting an assurance service, especially if it is realized by an accountant provider, except that the information is standardised according to the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines and the contracted service is comparable to the financial audit standards, has assurance for a reasonable/high level, and is carried out according to the ISAE3000 standard.

On the basis of the view that the board's evaluation of the CEO is determined by the board decision-making as a group, we adopt the faultline approach to analyze group dynamics in the board. Faultlines can split a board based on the alignment of multiple attributes of individual directors and potentially create subgroups within the board. In this study, we argue that different types of faultlines have distinct effects on board decision-making. Specifically, we predict that demographic faultlines can increase conflicts among directors, hampering the board's ability to decide on CEO dismissal when firm performance is below the aspiration level. On the other hand, information-based faultlines can facilitate exchange of diverse knowledge and elaboration of alternative perspectives, which can improve the board's ability to dismiss a CEO when firm performance is below the aspiration level. Our analysis of S&P 500 boards supports our prediction that board faultlines based on demographic attributes of directors significantly reduce the board's ability to fire the CEO when firm performance is below the aspiration level, whereas faultlines based on information-related attributes magnify the board's ability to dismiss a poor-performing CEO. By demonstrating different effects of faultlines based on heterogenous types of director attributes, this study contributes to the board faultline literature. We also contribute to CEO dismissal research by showing how group dynamics of boards moderates the relationship between firm performance and CEO dismissal. (c) The Author(s) 2022.

Purpose: This paper examines the evolution and determinants of the extent and quality of corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure in a developing country (Mauritius). Design/methodology/approach: CSR disclosures from annual reports of all listed companies were hand-collected for a 12-year period (2007-2018). The extent of disclosure was measured using a dichotomous index (41 items) while the quality of each disclosure item was assessed on a three-point scale. We rely on organisational legitimacy and resource dependence theories to investigate (1) trends in CSR disclosure extent and quality (2) the role of selected board and firm characteristics, namely the business qualifications of board members, extent of cross-directorships and the firm's use of employee volunteering scheme, on CSR disclosure. Findings: CSR disclosure extent, notably in relation to environment and human resources, gradually increased to an overall score of 45%. Comparatively, the quality of disclosures was low, with an average score of 20%. The proportion of business-qualified directors is only positively associated with CSR disclosure extent. The extent of cross-directorships is negatively associated with CSR disclosure quality while employee volunteering is positively associated with disclosure extent and quality. Originality/value: The findings reveal the relatively low quality of information being disclosed, and in spite of CSR and governance reforms, there seems to be limited influence from the board of directors and their networks; prompting a call to foster greater board engagement on CSR matters. The results also highlight the need for a multi-dimensional assessment of CSR disclosure. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This paper examines whether gender diversity (GD) on corporate boards influences financial performance (FP) of Indian firms using System Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) methods by considering panel data of 364 firms during 2017 to 2021, comprising of 1820 firm-year observations. The study reveals that the mere presence of a woman director (WD) on boards makes no difference in financial performance. Presence of WDs as a significant portion of the boards and their active roles in the functioning and governance of companies positively contribute to firms' financial performances and economic value creation. Regarding other governance parameters, the study shows that larger boards do not necessarily improve firm performance. Also, independent directors do not necessarily add value to corporate performance and value creation. While a higher promoter's stake is an important factor for Indian companies to drive corporate performance, firms with separate CEO and chairperson outperform firms with CEO duality. The study also reveals that the covid 19 pandemic has negatively influenced the financial performance and economic profit generation of the Indian firms. This study is important for several reasons. First, this study considers the period (2017-2021) when Indian companies adopted new financial reporting practices (IND-AS) in line with International Financial Reporting System (IFRS), the mandatory quota system of women directors' appointment is implemented and new corporate governance norms are implemented. Hence, our study contributes to the literature by proving meaningful insights on the role of gender diversity and other corporate governance parameters on financial performance of Indian firms in the light of newly adopted accounting and financial reporting practices. Second, few previous India based studies have mostly used pooled OLS or fixed effect models, and did not address the endogeneity problem in different forms like Dynamic Endogeneity, Simultaneity, and Unobserved Heterogeneity. This paper addresses the endogeneity problem appropriately by using the system generalized method of moments (GMM) while modelling the relation between WDs and firms' FP. Therefore, the findings of this study are more reliable and unbiased and can be useful for effective policy making on gender diversity and corporate governance issues. Third, few prior studies which have looked into the role of WDs on FP of Indian firms, have mostly used return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and Tobin's Q as performance parameters. Here, in addition to ROA, ROE and Tobin's Q, we also use economic value added (EVA) as indicators of corporate performance to understand the role of WDs on economic value creation for companies. The EVA is considered as modern technique to measure the economic profit earned by a firm, and it has gained huge popularity among companies as an improved technique for measuring financial performance for companies. To the best of our knowledge, the role of WDs on economic value creation by firms has not been investigated before particularly in the Indian context. This is another unique contribution of this study. Fourth, the Covid 19 pandemic had impacted global economy severely and India was no exception. Financial performances of most Indian firms were negatively impacted due to the nationwide lockdown and uncertainties about production, revenue and earnings. This study considers both the pre and post Covid 19 pandemic period in examining our central research question using a year dummy. Therefore, our study also captures whether the covid 19 pandemic has actually impacted the financial performance of Indian firms, while modelling this relation. This is another valuable and unique contribution of this study to the literature. The findings of this study provide an understanding of how board gender diversity and other governance parameters influence financial performance of Indian firms in an emerging market context. The outcomes are also explained and aligned with the relevant policy implications in the light of recent Indian corporate governance norms and policies. These findings are useful to the companies and policymakers, as they can use these findings while designing effective boards, which can be useful in improving firm performance. Board of directors, investors, regulators, and policymakers can effectively use these findings to understand how gender diverse boards and other corporate governance parameters influence firms' financial performance under the concentrated ownership pattern.

Purpose: This paper aims to examine the impact of corporate governance (CG) on sustainability disclosure (SD) from the perspectives of resource dependence, agency and stakeholder theories in the context of Jordan. Design/methodology/approach: The analyses were based on 405 observations from non-financial firms listed on the Amman Stock Exchange, spanning the period of 2014-2018. The CG that influences SD was examined using panel data regression models. Findings: The results of the current study show a positive and significant relationship between the extent of SG and the audit committee and board of directors' effectiveness. In terms of ownership structure, both institutional and foreign ownerships yielded an insignificant relationship with the extent of SDs. Practical implications: The analyses have implications for practitioners, policymakers, top management and corporate executives. Firms are encouraged to restructure their board of directors to enhance the effectiveness of the board to better monitor and support better SD. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to examine the determinants of SD in Jordan firms. This paper adopted a newly developed global reporting initiative-based reporting index that identifies companies with good sustainability practices. This adds value to the existing sustainability literature. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of human capital related to gender and nationality diversity in boards of directors on the innovation of university spin-offs (USOs) in their entrepreneurial ecosystem. Following the intellectual capital (IC) framework and the resource dependence theory, upper echelons theory and critical mass theory, it hypothesizes that the relationship between board diversity and USOs' firm innovation is non-linear. Design/methodology/approach: To test the research hypotheses empirically, a sample of 827 Italian USOs over the period 2009-2018 was analyzed using zero-inflated Poisson regression modeling. A robustness test was also performed. Findings: Gender obstacles remain in USOs' entrepreneurial ecosystem, with little involvement of women in boards, and the benefits of human capital for firm innovation emerge with increased female representation. Nevertheless, a few foreign-born directors embody valued IC in terms of human capital from an internationally linked entrepreneurial ecosystem, which decreases with more foreign-born directors due to communication costs and coordination problems. Research limitations/implications: The emerging non-linear relationships imply that gender- and nationality-diverse boards in USOs constitute critical human capital factors boosting the devolvement of entrepreneurial processes, in terms of firm innovation, in university entrepreneurial ecosystems. Originality/value: This study contributes significantly to the move from traditional corporate governance analysis through an IC framework, fostering an understanding of the role of human capital and its diversity determinants in spurring firm innovation among USOs considering the university entrepreneurial ecosystem.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of Board of Directors Effectiveness (BODE) on the performance of Malaysian Takaful companies licensed by the Central Bank of Malaysia. In addition, the study investigates the moderating effect of Shariah Committee Quality (SCQ) on the relationship between BODE and companies' performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a sample of 11 Malaysian Takaful companies during the period of 2010-2017. While BDE and SCQ are measured using indices, performance is proxied using ROA and ROE. A panel fixed effect regression analysis is used to test the impact of the BDE on the financial performance of Malaysian Takaful companies and the moderator role of SCQ. Findings: The main finding of this study shows a positive association between BDE and performance. More specifically, boards with a high presence of independent, Muslim and female directors positively contribute to the performance of Malaysian Takaful companies. Another interesting finding is related to the positive moderating effect of SCQ on the relationship between BDE and performance. This result indicates that a high level of SCQ combined with a high level of board effectiveness improve performance. Practical implications: The finding is of great importance to stakeholders and policymakers to improve their board effectiveness and the quality of the Shariah committee to reduce agency costs and to improve the performance of Malaysian Takaful companies. Originality/value: This study adds to the prior literature by investigating for the first time the relationship between BDE and performance and the interaction effect of SCQ on the performance of Malaysian Takaful companies.

Board composition has received increasingly more attention from scholars as an important determinant of environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. Two factors of board composition receive attention as they strongly relate to sustainability issues: gender diversity and board independence. The aim of this study is to test whether the presence of a critical mass of women in boardrooms correlates with firm ESG performance. In addition, we aim to study whether women receiving appointment as executive rather than nonexecutive directors may positively influence ESG performance. Using a sample of Italian companies listed on the Mercato Telematico Azionario during 2003-2019, the empirical results show that a critical mass of at least three female directors is necessary to improve ESG performance and that executive women directors represent a crucial component of board mechanisms, in terms of aligning the needs of stakeholders, since they increase ESG performance. Because the advising and monitoring functions impact firm value, we support the idea that female directors in strategic positions in the boardroom may benefit ESG performance. Thus, we support the idea of increasing women's presence on corporate boards and across executive leadership as a measure and a signal of how firms can respond to ESG challenges.

The current study looked at the impact of board of director characteristics on corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the Pakistani setting. The study further added to the body of knowledge by comparing the impact of board characteristics in family versus non-family businesses in an emerging market. The study's sample consists of 139 non-financial Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) listed firms from 2008 to 2019. The level of CSR among sample firms was assessed using a multidimensional financial approach. The random-effect model was employed to test the study's hypotheses. The findings support the dysfunctional view of the role of the board of directors' in family-owned businesses. Overall, board size and CEO duality have a significant negative impact on CSR, whereas board independence has a significant positive impact. While these findings applied to both family-owned and non-family-owned businesses. It was discovered that among family-owned businesses, boards tend to look after the interests of family members, and thus are less likely to support CSR. The findings of this study will assist regulatory authorities, investors, and financial analysts in understanding CSR practices in Pakistani firms, allowing them to review the role of the board of directors in CSR among family and non-family-owned firms.

The present study examines the relationship between the diverse board of directors and firm performance using a panel data sample of the top 73 EU nonfinancial sustainable firms across 13 countries from 2016 to 2020 based on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI). We specifically examine the impact of structural (board independence) and demographical (age, gender, education, tenure and industry experience) board diversity on firm performance. Drawing on the agency and resource base perspective, the results indicate that firms with a diverse board of directors (structural and demographic) perform significantly better with firm performance. Additionally, when viewed through the lens of stakeholder theory, the findings indicate that environmental, social and governance disclosure (ESG) moderates and partially mediates the relationship between the diverse board of directors and firm performance. We also performed robust checks to validate our results. Diversity contributes to a firm's understanding of its market and, as a result, its overall performance. The current study demonstrates a considerable gap between the theoretical and empirical support for various board indicators (structural and demographic), their relationship to performance, and how ESG acts as an intervening element in increasing firm financial performance.

Purpose: This paper aims to present a catalogue of the influential aspects resulting from a bibliometric meta-analysis of political connection literature. Design/methodology/approach: This study undertakes a bibliometric meta-analysis review of political connections literature, covering 138 research papers from 2000 to 2020 using the visualization of similarities viewer program. Findings: The authors identify six research groups: the value of political connections; political connections and finance; political connections in banks; political connections and debt; management and political connections; and political connections and governance. This study discusses each stream through a cartographic analysis, including co-authorship, countries and time networks. Originality/value: This study makes an important and novel contribution to political connection literature. So far, to the best of the authors' knowledge, it is the only bibliometric study on political connections. This study is the first to use network analysis and community detection to understand social clustering and to identify main research steams in political connection literature.

We explore the extent to which board political connections shape the firm's disclosure behavior. We focus on the disclosure of non-GAAP earnings measures and argue that board political connections reduce the firm's propensity to report non-GAAP earnings through two mechanisms: the reduction in capital market pressure (insulating effect) and the concerns about public scrutiny (constraining effect). Our theory is tested and supported by an analysis of U.S.-listed firms in the period 2003-2019. We further exploit the variation in firms' media exposure to identify the primary mechanism underlying this disclosure strategy and find that the constraining effect plays a more important role than the insulating effect in driving the financial reporting behavior of politically connected firms.

Meta-analytic results show that board gender diversity is modestly associated with firm performance, but there is notable heterogeneity among findings. Board gender diversity allows access to women's perspectives, potentially helping boards, but diversity can also trigger biases that exclude women directors, such that boards do not integrate meaningful perspectives. Addressing this problem, we leverage the categorization-elaboration model, contact theory, and critical mass theory to build new theory as to how men directors can serve as allies to women directors to better leverage diverse perspectives. We empirically test how considerations that reduce out-group categorization and bias against women moderate the board gender diversity-firm performance relationship. Our results show that gender diverse boards perform better with more formal contact among men and women director colleagues, and that gender diverse boards with more men directors who only have prior experience working with token-women, perform worse. Our work helps explain how and why board gender diversity can improve or detract from firm performance. This extends the literature by illustrating the important consequences that occur when firms do (or do not) have men directors who are likely to be allies of gender diversity.

Purpose: Cybersecurity disclosure (CSD) provides users with valuable information and significant insights about a firm's susceptibility to cyber risk and its management. It is argued that the board of directors, with its oversight role, should be vigilant in managing cyber risk and disclosures. This study aims to measure the extent of CSD of the banking companies and examines the association between the characteristics of board composition (i.e. board size, board independence and gender diversity) and CSD. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted automated content analysis to find out the extent of CSD in the listed commercial banks of an emerging country, Bangladesh, where CSD is voluntary. Further, multiple linear regression is applied to determine the relationship between board composition and CSD. Findings: The findings reveal an increasing trend of CSD over the sample period (2014-2020). The study confirms a significant positive relationship between board independence and CSD. The study also demonstrates that the higher presence of female directors on the board is associated with higher CSD. However, no consistently significant relationship is found between board size and CSD. Research limitations: The study is based on listed banking companies only. Hence, the results can not be generalised to companies in other sectors. Also, it is important to acknowledge that we focused on the quantity (not the quality) of CSD contained in annual reports. Practical implications: The study provides an overall understanding of current trends of CSD in the Banking sector of a developing country. Regulators may use our findings to understand the current level of CSD and assess the need for issuing guidance in this regard. The association between board composition and CSD has implications both for banks when selecting board members and policymakers when establishing requirements concerning board composition under corporate governance guidelines. Originality/value: This is one of the very few studies in the context of an emerging economy where CSD is voluntary. The paper contributes to a narrow stream of research investigating CSD and its association with board composition. Notably, it contributes to understanding how board composition is associated with CSD in the banking industry, which is highly exposed to cyber risk. (c) 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

For several decades, the boards of directors have been relatively homogeneous groups consisting of white old men (the so-called 'good-old boys'). This static and apparently immutable feature has been changed recently, as social movements and the evolution of corporate law and good governance codes promoted an increasing diversity in the boardroom. In parallel with the diffusion of more diverse boards, leadership and governance scholars have started to analyze the consequences of board diversity. Based on the idea that members' diversity increases group experiences and viewpoints, most scholars argued that higher board diversity positively affects board decisions and firm outcomes. However, despite the soundness of this perspective and the number of previous studies, the empirical evidence provides only partial, mixed and inconclusive findings. Building on these premises, we did a systematic and interdisciplinary literature review aimed at taking stock of our understanding of board diversity's antecedents and consequences. Our analysis and critical assessment of 184 studies synthesizes major results, identifies main gaps, and highlights important avenues for further research. Finally, we outline several ways to overcome current (theoretical and methodological) barriers and further advance research on board diversity. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

In recent decades, there has been a growing demand for companies to take responsibility for the adverse social and environmental effects caused by their activities. As a result, they are no longer only accountable for their economic performance but also their corporate social responsibility. An important pillar of corporate social responsibility is gender diversity in the company as a whole and on the board of directors in particular. The hospital sector, whose activity in itself requires social responsibility, was later than other sectors in its disclosure. This research aims to analyze the influence of corporate social responsibility, together with gender diversity on boards of directors and the COVID-19 pandemic, on the profitability of Spanish private hospitals. In addition, this research studies the dissemination of COVID-19 throughout the Spanish territory, relating wealth and risk. For this purpose, data corresponding to the period 2017-2020 were analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis, cluster analysis, and factor analysis. The results show that those socially responsible hospitals show higher profitability, but no causal relationship has been established. Gender diversity negatively influences the profitability of the private hospital sector, although it can be considered non-significant. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the profitability of hospitals, causing a sharp drop. The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic was mainly influenced by the population density of the territories but also by public health investment, showing a greater propensity to control the pandemic in those regions that allocate more funds to health care.

Endowed with significant firm-specific knowledge, inside directors can contribute to the decision-making processes of the boardroom. However, regulatory changes, focusing primarily on the monitoring function of the boards, have driven inside directors out of the boardroom. This article argues that suppliers with firm- and industry-specific knowledge are uniquely positioned to fill a critical void in boardrooms. It also suggests that the value of having a supplier on the board (SOTB) is influenced by environmental contingencies faced by a firm: operational efficiency, diversification, and demand uncertainty. Using an objective measure of supplier presence in the boardroom, the authors find that a supplier's presence enhances firm performance. They also find that the value of an SOTB in enhancing performance is greater in firms with lower operational efficiency and higher demand uncertainty and, is lower in firms with higher diversification. These results are robust to potential endogeneity issues, alternative estimation methods, and measures of moderator and outcome variables. (c) 2022 Production and Operations Management Society.

Recently, companies in the energy sector have faced multiple financial and environmental risks. This finding demonstrates the need for energy companies to disclose risk information. However, academic attention on risk disclosure (RD) remains limited. Through manual content analysis and a regression model, this study examines the effect of the features of the board of directors and audit committee on the RD level in sustainability reports. The empirical findings reveal that the size and independence of the board of directors and the size of the audit committee positively affect the RD level. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd

George Floyd's murder caused many firms to reveal how exposed they are to racial diversity issues. We examine investor and firm behaviors after this socially significant event to provide evidence on the valuation effects of the exposure and ensuing corporate responses. We develop a text-based measure of a firm's exposure to racial diversity issues from conference call transcripts and find that, after the murder of George Floyd, firms with diversity exposure experience a stock price decrease of approximately 0.7% around the date of the conference call. We provide evidence that this effect is attributable to race-related exposure and not gender-related exposure. Initiatives taken by firms mitigate the negative market reaction. We document that firms with racial diversity exposure respond by appointing Black directors. The stock market views appointments of Black directors more favorably after George Floyd's murder, except when they are perceived as symbolic. We also find that firms with greater exposure to racial diversity are more likely to establish diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) departments, appoint DEI leaders, specify diversity goals, increase supply chain diversity, and donate to racial justice causes. Our paper provides evidence that exposure to racial diversity issues adversely affects firm value, and companies address the exposure by taking actions.

This paper examines the impact of corporate governance mechanisms on Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) disclosure in the utilities sector. We collected data from the Eikon Refinitiv database on 265 worldwide organisations operating in the utility sector during the 2011-2019 period. Findings evidence that board independence and the existence of a specific Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)/sustainability committee constitute positive drivers of utilities' overall ESG disclosure levels. Also, board size positively influences environmental and social disclosure. The study would encourage utilities to define their internal corporate governance mechanisms carefully, devoting primary attention to an accurate selection of the board of directors members.

Based on resource dependence theory we argue for an influence of business groups (BGs) on the board composition of constituent offshore financial multinational enterprises (FMNEs). Using a unique sample of 171 Caribbean FMNEs in an inter-island BG setting, we find BGs' control in constituent firms to be indicative of the importance of the internal financing and intermediation within the group network. This control leads to a higher proportion of lawyers hired to the boards of directors in BG-constituent firms and supports the argument that lawyers provide skills in complex offshore regulatory frameworks that facilitate BGs' optimal tax management. Furthermore, we observe that an increased adoption of shareholder rights governance by BG-constituent firms is associated with increased engagement with outside resource providers, increased potential conflicts of interest and hence a need for hiring more lawyers. Our interpretation is that offshore FMNEs have a need for more lawyers, whose legal skill is critical to the competitive advantage of FMNEs. (c) 2022 The Authors

Although the gender composition of corporate boards and the contribution of female directors to corporate governance have been previously analysed, few studies have investigated the factors that may help contribute to increasing the still scarce presence of women on boards. Therefore, using three-stage least squares (3SLS) estimation on a data panel comprising the 100 largest companies in the world according to the 2019 Fortune Global 500 ranking, including data on (re)election proposals for corporate board members, this research aims to analyse the influence of the number of men's nominations, board interlocks, director tenure, geographical area, the sector to which the firms belong, and the relevance of firms on women's nominations for boards of directors. The results show the factors that facilitate the presence of women on boards. In addition, the different influences that remain in the election of female and male directors when considering factors related to the experience, expertise, and networks of directors or the visibility of firms can also be observed. This study contributes to the knowledge of gender diversity on boards, shedding light on the factors that might lead to gender-balanced boards. It could also help companies and policymakers design strategies to build more egalitarian boards. (c) 2023 The Author(s)

Purpose: The existing literature involving director compensation has been concentrating on its absolute or intrinsic values. Although the relevant studies have generated mixed findings, research in other fields suggests that the power of an incentive may be determined by its value relative to the chosen referencing standard more than its absolute value. This study aims to investigate how relative director pay affects corporate investment efficiency. Design/methodology/approach: This study takes a fresh theoretical viewpoint by framing the investigation using the dimensional comparison theory and proposing that a directorship also presents a relative value that may influence the board's performance. Ordinary least squared regressions and two-stage system generalised method of moments are used to analyse 14,267 firm-year observations. Findings: The empirical results suggest that the relative director pay is a better estimate of the power of the incentive than the absolute pay. A positive association between the relative director pay and investment efficiency is evident, while the absolute pay has no significant effect on investment decisions. Director overcompensation, however, will cancel out the positive effect of director compensation on investment efficiency. Firms with relatively lower unexpected investment (UI) level benefit the most from an increase in the relative director pay, while neither absolute nor relative director pay affects investment choices in firms with a high UI level because of significantly more overcompensation. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first attempt to investigate the effect of relative director pay. It is also the first to examine the role of dimensional comparison in strategic decisions which is the single untended comparison framework in the director pay design. The current director pay structure has emphasised social and temporal equality by standardising the pay structure and vesting the equity-based pay over a long period. Yet it ignores the fact that people decide their commitment level by comparing the reward with an internal referent too. The findings speak to the dimensional comparison theory in that the inequality emanated from dimensional or internal comparison may be accentuated by the perceived equality in other comparison frameworks, driving the different performances in the roles one assumes.

In this chapter, the impact of board gender diversity on overall firm risk was investigated. Drawing on social identity theory, upper echelons theory, and agency theory, a hypothesis of a negative link between gender diversity on the board of directors and firm risk has been put forward. Using a panel data regression on a sample of large Tunisian companies listed on the Tunis Stock Exchange (BVMT) over the period 2016-2020, the author was able to provide empirical evidences supporting the existence of a significant negative impact of the percentage of women on boards of directors on stock return volatility as global firm risk proxy.

Purpose: This study intends to test the relationship between banks' board diversity, detected with age and gender characteristics, and banks' social performance. The resource dependence theory posits that board diversity is a strategic tool able to enrich the board of directors by expanding skills and the number of links with stakeholders, which have a strategic role in achieving a competitive advantage and sustainable goals, especially in the banking sector. Design/methodology/approach: The research hypotheses are tested using a sample of 46 European banks observed from 2009 to 2017. The gender and age diversity data of bank board members are hand-collected from banks' social reports. Findings: The empirical results show that bank social performance is positively influenced by board gender and age diversity. Thus, the human capital determined by a higher bank's board diversity constitutes an essential resource for adopting more sustainable business models. Originality/value: This paper analyses the association between board diversity and social performance, providing empirical evidence for the European banking sector in the period after the 2008 global financial crisis. The banking literature provides scarce evidence on the topic; however, the empirical results claim the strategic importance of the appointment of directors to the banks' boards to balance corporate strategy with social and environmental issues generating a positive impact on sustainable growth.

Recently, many firms that have caused direct pollution to the environment have begun to think about the necessity of environmental management. As buildings have played an important role in environmental issues, the real estate industry can no longer ignore demands for environmental management. Research on environmental management has mainly focused on its financial implications. However, there has been no consensus in the literature about the relationship between environmental management and firm performance. By comparing portfolios of environmentally certified properties of 19 lodging Real Estate Investment Trusts, this study explores the relationship between environmental management and firm performance, while taking into account the moderating role of outside board of directors. The relationship between environmental management and firm performance appeared to have mixed results, but this study found a positive moderating effect of outside board of directors. This study provides new insights into the hospitality and the real estate literature from a corporate governance perspective. (c) The Author(s) 2021.

China is facing an acute portable water problem and presents a picture of severe supply constraints. Thus, China 's water crisis offers attractive business opportunities for foreign water companies as well as domestic private water companies. Hence, the private sector participation in the Chinese water sector is a hot topic. This chapter investigates the impact of gender diversity on board of directors on the financial performance of the Chinese private water companies using ordinary least squares ( OLS ) and unbalanced panel ( random effects ) regression models, which are estimated as the baseline approach on a sample of 19 Chinese private water companies for the period of 2010-2017. The OLS and random effects results show that number of women on board (WB), percent of women on board (%WB), number of female executives (FE), and percent of female executives (%FE) affect the Chinese water companies' financial performance. The results of this chapter are important for researchers, regulators, and policymakers to benefit from policies that encourage board varieties at an individual water company level.

We study the impact of gender diversity in corporate boards on firm value by exploiting a natural experiment setting in India where the government mandated firms to appoint at least one female director on their boards. We find a significantly positive market reaction when firms comply with the mandate but only when they appoint qualified female directors who are not related to promoters. Moreover, market reward is higher for firms headquartered in states with severe gender bias. We show how regulatory intervention mitigates frictions related to gender bias to improve firm value through greater gender diversity when firms respond appropriately. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Despite increasing attention to gender diversity on corporate boards, we have only limited understanding of what occurs within the boardroom when women are present. Prior empirical research has used various theories to infer how board gender diversity may influence firm outcomes, but without identifying the theoretical mechanisms underlying women directors' influence on the board. To address this gap, we conducted interviews with women and men who have collectively served as directors with over 200 publicly listed companies in the United States and Europe. While prior research has suggested that the diverse cognitive perspectives women directors bring influence board decision-making, our study reveals novel insights as to the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, we contribute to the board gender diversity literature with the finding that women behave in ways contrary to existing board norms. By coming to board meetings highly prepared, being willing to acknowledge that they do not know something, asking questions, and getting things on the table, women impact the dialogue and interactions in the boardroom. Thus, our study sheds light on how the presence of women influences board dynamics, which has implications for corporate governance. Our findings also challenge prevailing gender theories as to how women are likely to behave, in that we do not find that women conform to gender stereotypes. Yet, we also find impediments to women directors' ability to gain influence, in that men directors may not always acknowledge them or afford them respect as equal board members.

This study investigates the association between a CEO's political ideology and Corporate Environmental Performance. Although previous research has established a strong association between a CEO's political ideology and overall performance on Corporate Social Responsibility, little research has examined how it relates to a firm's environmental impact. Utilizing data on CEO political donations, this study shows that a CEO's liberalism generally has a positive effect on a firm's environmental performance. However, this relationship can be influenced by the political conservatism of the board of directors. Furthermore, liberal CEOs are inclined to prioritize environmental strength and minimize environmental concerns. This research provides insight into the intricate dynamics of how a CEO's political ideology, as well as that of the board of directors, can influence a firm's environmental performance.

The present work aimed to shed light on the effect of board gender diversity (BGD) on real earnings management (REM) as well as the moderating role of auditor reputation in the association between BGD and REM using panel data of 1162 French non-financial firm-year observations from the SBF120 index during the period 2005-2019. Our findings show that BGD is negatively related to REM. Furthermore, we found that this relationship is more prominent in firms with higher auditor reputation mainly because highly reputable auditors aim to preserve their image and are more likely to detect earnings management activities.

The article focuses on the implications of women directors for strategic disclosure by exploring their influence on the quality of business plan in terms of information comprehensiveness. To this aim, by using hand-collected data and combining content analysis with OLS regression, it examines a sample of publicly listed non-financial Italian firms. Findings show that, while the presence of a critical mass of women on board negatively influences the quality of business plan, women CFOs positively affect such strategic planning tool. Therefore, by showing that women directors influence the quality of one of the most effective strategic planning and communication tools, the study extends the research on the role of women for the strategic decision-making process and outcomes. It also enriches the literature on the determinants of the business plan and strategic disclosure by exploring how women directors prompt the related quality. Following the recent increasing attention of policy-makers towards the necessity to foster the women's involvement in company activity that has been also strongly pushed by the socio-economical COVID-19 consequences, the article informs firms and practitioners about the beneficial implications of appointing women in apical positions for the level of company strategic disclosure quality.

Purpose: One of the most active areas of study in the field of corporate governance, board interlocks is a phenomenon that is both pervasive and perplexing. This paper aims to examine and integrate the empirical research on board interlocks to fill the void left by the lack of a recent review. Design/methodology/approach: The bibliometric analysis methodology, which emphasizes methodological rigor and transparency, was used to analyze the board interlocks literature. Eighty publications published since 2000 were chosen as the subject of this research because they reveal the key contributions to the field of board interlocks. Additionally, their clustering pattern is also identified. Findings: The authors classify various studies conducted on board interlocks into three clusters: "Social Capitalization", "Antecedents and Outcomes" and "Corporate Governance". Originality/value: This literature review helps better comprehend the board interlocks literature by pointing out several areas of study that, if pursued, would add to the existing body of knowledge and open future research directions.

Research summary: Drawing on research about power and faultlines, we identify the subgroup of directors in the board who share the same social identities with the CEO (i.e., CEO subgroup) and develop a concept of CEO subgroup power. We examine how CEO subgroup power affects the board's decision to dismiss the CEO, particularly when the firm experiences a performance decline. Using data from S&P 500 boards from 1998 to 2018, we find that powerful CEO subgroups reduce the risk of CEO dismissal and that the negative effect of CEO subgroup power on CEO dismissal is magnified when the firm experiences a decline in performance. Managerial summary: Why do some boards fire the CEO when the firm is performing well, while others retain the CEO despite poor performance? We believe that looking into power dynamics among directors may help answer this question. Using data from S&P 500 boards from 1998 to 2018, we investigate how the risk of CEO dismissal varies by the power of the subgroup within the board that consists of directors who share the same social identities with the CEO (i.e., CEO subgroup). The results reveal that a powerful CEO subgroup can reduce the CEO dismissal risk and that this effect becomes stronger when the firm goes through a performance decline.

Based on agency and asymmetric information theories, the objective of this paper is to investigate whether the transparency on corporate governance is determined by strategies followed by the board of directors (liquidity, investment, capital structure, innovation and board composition impact on the corporate governance transparency). The study sample is composed by 826 observations from Latin American firms during the period 2004-2010 (128 unique firms). A two-way cluster standard errors and GMM methods have been adopted to perform the econometric analysis. Results suggest that corporate governance disclosure is attributable to changes on firm's decisions made by the board with respect to financial aspects and innovation. However, the impact upon transparency of board composition with regards to female directors, independence and size of boards are attributable to industry and/or country effects. Although the main limitation of the study is focused on the period of analysis, the results provide important implications for the business sector, demonstrating that the board composition and the financial and innovation strategies adopted by the board encourage greater corporate transparency, thus increasing confidence in the markets.

Purpose: The paper aims to investigate the impact of political connections and board ethnicity on the value relevance of earnings and book value in Mauritius. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on a sample of 541 Mauritian-listed firm-year observations for 2001-2016. Financial and board diversity data have been collected using the listed firms' annual reports and from reports published by the Stock Exchange of Mauritius. Political connection data was derived from the directory of Chief of State and Cabinet members. The research hypotheses were empirically tested using a modified Ohlson (1995) price model. Findings: This study shows that political connections negatively impact the value relevance of earnings and book value. The authors find that firms with Franco-Mauritian directors will constrain political connections' negative impact. The authors find contrasting results for Indo-Mauritian directors since they form an integral part of the government in Mauritius. Originality/value: This study contributes to the scarce accounting literature in Mauritius. Firstly, no study has investigated the relationship between the value relevance of accounting information and political connections in Mauritius. Secondly, Mauritius's capital market is dominated by a non-indigenous ethnic group, Franco-Mauritians, who remain the economic elite. Hence, Mauritius presents an opportunity to bring forth another important aspect in the capital market and corporate governance; diversity on the board of directors. Therefore, the study extends to the political connections and board diversity literature. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Purpose: This study examines the association between internal corporate governance mechanisms (i.e. board of directors and audit committee) and the information value of bank earnings. The authors comparatively assess this association across different bank types, Islamic versus conventional banks. The authors also investigate the mediating effect of Shariah governance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors utilize a unique and an international sample of 723 bank-year observations representing 100 listed banks from 16 countries during the period 2007-2015. The authors investigate the characteristics of the board of directors and audit committee (i.e. size and independence) and employ three core analyses for earnings informativeness (i.e. earnings persistence, cash flow predictability and reliability of loan loss provisions). Additional analyses address Shariah supervisory boards' (SSBs') size, financial expertise and multiple outside directorships. The authors use the random-effect Generalised Least Squares (GLS) estimation technique and provide several robustness checks and sensitivities. Findings: The authors find that, on average, having large and independent boards (and audit committees) increases the informativeness of reported earnings for banks. Conditional on bank type, our results report strong evidence for differential effects across the two alternative banking systems. In Islamic banks, large and independent board of directors (and audit committees) is positively associated with all measures of information value. There is insignificant evidence for conventional banks. However, SSBs show no significant effect on the reported earnings' informativeness. Originality/value: This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, that empirically and comparatively assesses the information value of reported earnings in association with effective internal governance while recognizing the institutional characteristics of different bank types. The authors offer new insights to policymakers, investors and other stakeholders located within countries operating on a dual banking system. The results could help regulators to improve their rules/guidance related to double-layer governance and financial reporting quality. (c) 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

We analyze the impact of women on corporate boards of directors on product quality. We innovate firstly by integrating the broad but fragmented research on the topic, offering a first simultaneously testing of a larger set of variables identified to be significant in earlier studies. Second, we add alternative indicators of female representation in board of directors as a potential determinant of product quality. Third, we use evaluation scores of goods by the nonprofit foundation "Stiftung Warentest" as a quality indicator, thus adding to a regionally diversified evidence. We find a significant positive effect of female board directors on product quality. (c) 2023, The Author(s).

Purpose: The empirical study aims to examine the impact of board diversity with respect to gender and nationality on firm performance in an emerging economy. This research further splits the sample into family and non-family domains and investigates the diversity-performance nexus in isolation. Design/methodology/approach: The sample consists of 183 listed companies in Bangladesh over the period 2007 to 2017. This study employed the generalised method of moments (GMM) technique to address the possible endogeneity issue in the governance-performance connection. To underscore the strength of diversity, three distinctive assessment measures were used: percentage representation of females and foreign directors, the Blau index and the Shannon index. Findings: The results for the full sample models reveal that board heterogeneity regarding both female and foreign directors positively and significantly influences firm performance as measured by return on assets (ROA). Further to this, female directors in family-owned businesses have a positive association with profitability, whereas foreign nationals demonstrate a significant positive association with performance in non-family firms. Additionally, at least three women directors are needed to make a positive difference in profitability; however, a sole director with foreign nationality is capable of demonstrating a similar impact on performance. Practical implications: The findings are significant for policymakers and organisations that advocate diversity on corporate boards of directors, and the minimum number of diverse board members needs to be considered depending on the identity to bring about a significant change in organisational outcome. Therefore, the findings of this study may be applied to other emerging economies with similar institutional characteristics. Originality/value: This study reinforces the existing stock of knowledge on the impact of board diversity on the profitability of firms, especially in the context of an emerging economy - Bangladesh. Irrespective of the given backdrop, this study finds that both gender and nationality diversity in the case of Bangladesh is found to have a positive and significant effect on financial performance with respect to all the diversity metrics, i.e. the proportionate number of female and foreign directors on the boards, the Blau index and the Shannon index.

Purpose: Do women contribute to performance of companies on which they serve as board of directors? Many prior studies examine this issue, but no consensus is reached on the benefits of women taking on leadership positions. The present study considers this thorny issue from a slightly different perspective. Does the association between gender diversity and business performance vary across sectors and economic cycles? Design/methodology/approach: The sample for this study was derived from the firms included in the S&P Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) 300 Index, and the study period of 2004-2016 allowed authors to consider the effects of different sectors as well as different economic cycles on the relationship between gender diversity of boards and business performance. The authors consider the Australian context, which is somewhat unique from the other Western countries, as quotas on boards of directors are not made mandatory and the corporate governance practices are principle-based rather than rule-based. Findings: Employing panel data models, at the aggregate level, the authors find no evidence of board gender diversity impacting business performance. Consideration of sectoral differences and economic cycles in the empirical analyses yielded additional insights. In particular, gender diversity has a beneficial association with performance for businesses in the services and financial sectors after the changes to corporate governance guidelines relating to diversity in 2010. These economic benefits, however, are not evidenced in the resources sector. Research limitations/implications: These findings offer support for critical mass and resource dependence theories. Practical implications: The findings of this study have implications for inclusion and diversity policies of businesses and the society. Specifically, the findings offer support for gender diversity of corporate boards of directors. Originality/value: This study highlights that women bring their unique skills and experiences to create economic value in sectors where they traditionally have more experience and opportunities.

Drivers of environmentally conscious firm behaviour have gained increasing attention over past decades. The Board of Directors holds a central role in corporate decision-making, and previous empirical evidence suggests that its characteristics could influence corporate environmental performance. This paper contributes to the literature with the first evidence of the influence certain board characteristics have on whether a firm ultimately supports one or more environmental SDGs. Our focus is on board size, gender diversity, board independence and CEO duality. Logistic and fractional regressions on 4417 globally listed firms highlight that board size, the share of female directors, and the share of independent directors are significant drivers of support for environmental SDGs. The results and insights revealed in this study should be helpful to policymakers, investors and corporations in evaluating the effectiveness of corporate governance characteristics and fostering corporate contributions to the 2030 Agenda.

Our paper analyses the characteristics of the boards of directors of the best performing listed Italian banks during the last global financial crisis (from 2008 to 2015). Through a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), the study identifies three different board configurations (archetypes) that these banks adopted: a committee-based board, a gender diversity-based board, and a large size-based board. Although different in some of their characteristics, these configurations share the rationale of favouring the advisory services that the board can provide to managers in their decision-making activities. These services, in turn, are particularly valuable in a time of high risk and uncertainty for banks. With its results, the paper contributes to the literature on the relationship between board characteristics and organisational performance and to a better understanding of the configurations that can best serve when firms' decision-making, for various reasons, becomes particularly complex and can benefit from board support. Our results also contribute to further detail the governance characteristics of banks in the Italian context. Copyright (c) 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

How private firms can overcome their unique governance challenges remains an important but understudied topic. Using novel data on more than 28,000 private firms in India from 1988 to 2017, we examine whether private firms can improve their survival prospects by having board interlocks with public firms and, specifically, interlocks whereby a public firm director subsequently joins the private firm's board. In our data, we found a U-shaped relationship between the number of incoming board interlocks and the probability of private firm exit. We also found that board interlocks formed by public firm directors of public firms audited by Big Four companies improve private firms' survival more than other interlocks, consistent with the notion that such interlocks improve monitoring at private firms. Overall, our study points toward the importance of considering the role of incoming board interlocks when explaining private firm survival. (c) The Author(s) 2023.

Purpose: This paper aims to analyze the thematic content of research addressing the relation between board of directors (BoD) and business transformation (BT) to obtain better understanding of status and to derive future areas of study. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews literature through a bibliometric analysis based on co-occurrence of articles published in Web of Science Core Collection (tm) (WoS) between 1990 and 2022, identifying key concepts, setting network of relations and identifying the strategic importance of clusters of concepts. Findings and implications are discussed, future lines of research are presented and limitations are noted. Findings: Thematic research on boards addressing transformation shifted from the analysis of individuals' traits to an organizational approach with majority of research centered on the role of boards under different theories and the consequences of strategic changes on firm's performance. Further research is around gender diversity, sustainability and the moderating role of ownership structure and business culture. Research limitations/implications: Some limitations are also noted. This analysis considered articles indexed by WoS for Q1+Q2 publications as source of literature, while including others such as Scopus would increase knowledge base. Also, to identify main streams of research, the authors considered keywords with cumulative occurrence spanning from 30% to 40% while increasing this percentage would add terms that might improve precision to the connections among keywords. Other techniques could have been used such as co-citation or bibliographic coupling, although the authors find these as better suited to investigate the basic structure behind the foundational knowledge of the topic while the authors' intention was to understand the positioning of study fields regarding the degree of research progress. Practical implications: This paper presents some practical implications for future researchers. Those who wish to leverage previous evidence to address new research questions might look into principal themes covering BoD dynamics and composition to exert CG, and the relation between strategic decisions and performance measured by different variables. Those who wish to position their research as new findings to shed light on dilemmas, might find opportunities in the fields of climate change-sustainability, R&D for growth and innovation under the perspective of intangible assets. Originality/value: This paper, is the first to the best of the authors' knowledge, to identify research clusters for the intersection of boards and transformation and to determine their stage of development.

Rationale/Purpose: The Australian Football League's (AFL) governance structure is largely unique in the context of professional sports leagues, yet it has rarely been studied. This paper analyses the various components of the AFL's "Independent Commission" governance structure and draws comparisons with European football's "club-run" leagues. Method: This is a primarily conceptual paper that involves documentary analysis of constitutional documents and governance reports relating to the AFL. Findings: The AFL's governance structure is characterised by a Commission of independent members that, in stark contrast to European football, has near complete powers to run the league through the CEO. While the AFL is "owned" by its clubs, they have limited constitutional power to influence decision-making, but are able to hold the Commission accountable through their ability to elect and remove its members. A policy of "active engagement" exists within the AFL with the intention of promoting harmony between key stakeholders. Research Contribution: This paper contributes to sport governance research by presenting new insight on how the AFL's distinctive governance structure works from a constitutional perspective and highlights the efficiencies the structure (or elements thereof) may yield in other league contexts. Practical Implications: The paper provides practitioners across the sport industry with an in-depth look at an under-researched and seemingly effective league governance structure, which can inform their debates on sport governance reform.

Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the impact of family governance, including founder directors and their ties to family members on the board, on the social performance of microfinance institutions (MFIs), a special kind of social enterprise with dual objectives. Research Findings/Insights: Using a dataset of 735 MFIs operating in Bangladesh from 2007 to 2017, we find that founder directors and board members with family ties to the founder have an adverse impact on MFIs' social performance. These findings hold when we perform several robustness tests and endogeneity tests. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We contribute to the corporate governance literature on MFIs and social enterprises in two ways. First, our findings suggest that, when MFIs are confronted with dual performance objectives, founder directors may "trade off" social outcomes in favor of economic outcomes and therefore adversely affect MFIs' social performance. Second, our findings extend the literature by showing that the presence of board members with family ties to founder directors also adversely affects MFIs' social performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study suggests that MFIs' board composition influences their governance and ability to oversee their social and financial performance effectively. If MFIs' social performance is a major concern of national policy makers, then regulation should be put in place to limit board recruitment with family ties. (c) 2023 The Authors.

This study investigated the diversity of the BOD and explored its impact on corporate governance through quantitative empirical analysis. This study uniquely adopted Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporate Governance 100 Index (TWSE CG 100 Index) as the measurement of corporate governance performance. Five highly related indicators, i.e. gender, independence, education, legal, finance or accounting profession, and seniority to measure board diversity, which could be efficient variables on predicting the firms' likelihood being listed in the TWSE CG 100 Index, were used as independent variables. The results showed that board independence and the seniority of directors have a positive impact on corporate governance. This study made several important contributions. First, this study shed light on the conflicting evidence on the relationship between board diversity and firm corporate governance performance for the Taiwan economy. Second, this paper uniquely adopted TWSE CG 100 Index, and the findings can contribute to giving investors predictions about the quality of corporate governance and can serve as an incentive for corporates to enhance superior corporate governance. Furthermore, this study can contribute to practice by providing optimization suggestions for BOD composition and nomination. At last, this paper demonstrated policy justifications and implications for Taiwan government. (c) 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Purpose: Firm performance has become a thriving research field. However, a review of previous studies shows that the answers to several fundamental questions remain vague and require further investigation. Thus, the purpose of this study is twofold. The first is to determine the extent of the involvement of political connections (PCs) in Pakistani-listed companies, and the second is to examine the association between PCs and firm financial performance with director efficacy's moderating role. Design/methodology/approach: A data set of 221 non-financial companies listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange for 10 years (2008-2017) was analysed using panel-corrected standard error regression. Additionally, the authors address endogeneity issue by using Hackman two-stage estimation and lagged variables regression. Findings: The study found that PCs negatively affected the firm's financial performance, and director efficacy as a moderator strengthened this relationship. The result is consistent with the political economy theory that argues that an unstable political system and a weak judicial system will strongly affect investors and their rights. Practical implications: The impact of political influence on the corporate sector remains a concern for policymakers, regulators, investors, financial experts, auditors and academic researchers. This study's findings are that an effective board of directors can strengthen the company's best practices by controlling political connectedness to protect all the interested parties, particularly investors, and restore their confidence. Therefore, the results of this study can assist all stakeholders when a PCs exists to make the right decisions. Originality/value: The study extends the literature in terms of theoretical contribution that uses an integrative approach to combine political economy theory, agency theory and resource dependence theory to address the moderating role of director efficacy with an association between PCs and firm financial performance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no extant research has investigated the association between PCs and firm financial performance using five aspects of PCs, along with moderator director efficacy.

Research Question/Issue: Information processing, agency, and resource dependence perspectives provide diverging predictions regarding the relationship between board interlocks and firm performance, which are rooted in different perspectives on the roles of boards of directors. This study argues that these various approaches are reconcilable when considering the nature of board committees to which the interlocked directors are assigned. Research Findings/Insights: We test our hypotheses on a sample of 5133 firm-year observations in India. Our analyses support our hypotheses. The results show that interlocks between audit committees, whose primary function relates to providing financial oversight and ensuring compliance, are negatively related to firm performance. In contrast, interlocks between nomination and remuneration committees of Indian firms, which provide them with access to resources such as human capital and information on appropriate incentive structures, are positively related to performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study clarifies the relationship between board committee interlocks and firm performance by taking a multi-theoretical perspective. Our analysis suggests that information processing, agency, and resource dependence theories complement one another in explaining the effect of interlocks on firm performance. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results show that it is not board interlocks per se that are detrimental to firm performance; in fact, appointing well-connected directors with experience in serving on other boards might be beneficial for firms. However, firms should not assign specific monitoring-intensive tasks such as auditing to directors who also serve on other firms' audit committees. Our findings suggest that these directors should have greater independence and focus. (c) 2023 The Authors. Corporate Governance: An International Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

This study investigates the firms' CSR disclosure by considering the joint effects of board gender diversity and secrecy culture in an international setting. Building on a sample of 14,185 firm-year observations from 43 countries during 2010-2019, this study shows that while board gender diversity and CSR disclosure are positively associated, countries' secrecy levels negatively affect CSR disclosure. However, we provide evidence that the higher female representation on the board of directors significantly attenuates the restrictive role of secrecy culture on the CSR disclosure level. In other words, the suppressive effect of national secrecy on CSR disclosure weakens firms with higher gender diversity on the board of directors. Our results are robust to several sensitivity checks and endogeneity problems. This study suggests that the reducing effects of national secrecy culture on firms' CSR disclosure level can be attenuated by utilizing internal governance mechanisms such as board gender diversity.

Purpose: Are board ties among competitors harmful to customers? The prevalent assumption on board ties among competitors is that they harm customer benefits. This study examines the mechanism by which board ties with competitors result in an outcome conducive to customers. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 79 savings banks in South Korea, we investigate the extent of banks' board ties with other banks and their engagement in a project financing (PF) consortium from 2014 to 2020. The generalised least square was adopted to test the hypotheses. We also performed several supplemental analyses to further support our results. Findings/results: Savings banks with greater board ties with rivals provided more financial opportunities to their customers by forming PF consortia more actively with other banks. Furthermore, the positive impact of board ties on banks' participation in a PF consortium increases, especially when the proportion of external shareholders is smaller or when savings banks are family firms. Practical implications: Outside directors can not only play the role of monitoring the management but also serve as assistants who can help banks provide financial services (or products) that banks could not provide individually. Originality/value: While prior studies have clearly recognised the negative impacts on customers of board-friendship ties among rivals, little attention has been paid to the potential mechanism by which board ties among competing firms can benefit customers. This study challenges the dominant assumption by demonstrating that savings banks with greater board ties with other banks provide more financial opportunities to their economically weak customers. Contribution: Finally, this study contributes to the family business literature by providing insight into how the unique characteristics of family firms in strategic choices make outside directors contribute as assistants than supervisors.

In one of the most influential studies on family firm internationalization, Sciascia et al. (2012) advance a curvilinear relationship between family ownership and firm internationalization. We replicate their study adopting a three-step approach. First, we use the same measures on a different sample to test the generalizability of their findings. Second, we change the independent variable and hypothesize a negative relationship between family involvement in the board of directors and firm internationalization. Third, we introduce and measure the moderating role of firm age and firm size in this relationship. Our study advances the family firm internationalization literature both theoretically and methodologically. Theoretically, we show that it is not so much family ownership per se, but the influence the family obtains through board directorship that affects the family firm internationalization strategy. In addition, we show that this effect is moderated by firm age and size. Methodologically, our study is an important step forward toward increasingly transparent and replicable family business research. (c) 2023, The Author(s).

Purpose: This study aims to examine the link between boards and audit committees and firm performance in Kuwaiti listed firms in the context of recent and extensive corporate governance regulatory reform. Design/methodology/approach: Panel data regression analysis with fixed effects and clustered standard errors of firm performance for 61-97 listed industrial and services firms in Kuwait over a seven-year period. The dependent variables are the returns on assets and equity, the debt-to-equity ratio and leverage and Tobin's Q and the independent variables comprise board of directors and audit committee characteristics, including size, the number of meetings and the numbers of independent and outside board and expert committee members. Firm size, subsidiary status and cash flow serve as control variables. Findings: Mixed results with respect to the characteristics of the board of directors. Board size and independent and outsider board members positively relate only to Tobin's Q and insiders only to debt to equity. For audit committee characteristics, committee size, independence and expertise positively relate to the return on equity and committee size and expertise only to Tobin's Q. Of the five performance measures considered, board and audit committee characteristics together best determine Tobin's Q. Research limitations/implications: Data from a single country limits generalisability and control variables necessarily limited in a developing market context. Need for qualitative insights into corporate governance reform as a complement to conventional quantitative analysis. In combining accounting and market information, Tobin's Q appears best able to recognise the performance benefits of good corporate governance in terms of internal organisational change. Practical implications: The recent corporate governance code and guidelines reforms exert a mixed impact on firm performance, with audit committees, not boards, of most influence. But recent reforms implied most change to boards of directors. One suggestion is that non-market reform may have been unneeded given existing market pressure on listed firms and firms anticipating regulatory change. Social implications: Kuwait's corporate governance reforms codified corporate governance practices already in place among many of its firms in pursuit of organisational legitimacy, and while invoking substantial change to audit committees, involved minor change to firm performance, at least in the short term. Some firms may also have delisted in expectation of stronger corporate governance requirements. Regardless, these direct and indirect processes both improved the overall quality of listed firm corporate governance and performance in Kuwait. Originality/value: Seminal analysis of corporate governance reforms in Kuwait, which have rapidly progressed from no corporate governance code and guidelines to an initially voluntary and then compulsory regime. Only known analysis to incorporate both board of directors and audit committee characteristics. Reveals studies of the corporate governance-firm performance relationship may face difficulty in model specification, and empirical significance, given the complexity of corporate governance codes and guidelines, leads in changing firm behaviour and self-selection of firms into and out of regulated markets.

This research recognizes the increasing importance of the preservation of the natural environment for society as well as for the corporate sector. The study adopts a stakeholder-agency theory perspective to examine the influence of characteristics and effectiveness of the board of directors on the environmental disclosures made by the corporate sector. The method of content analysis was adopted for collecting information on board characteristics, board processes, and environmental disclosures made by the sample companies. The extent of environmental disclosure has been measured by using an Environmental Disclosures Index. It was found that a higher proportion of independent directors, the absence of chairman-CEO duality, and the overall board effectiveness had a significant positive influence on the extent of environmental disclosures. However, board diversity represented by female directors on the boards was found to have a statistically insignificant impact on environmental disclosures.

We expect board of director diversity to be reflected in the way directors carry out their monitoring and advisory roles, including succession planning, and to affect the governance of firms. We conceive that the behaviour of family firm boards is influenced by their demographic and cognitive diversity, which can in turn affect how directors perform their roles. We apply upper echelons theory (Hambrick and Mason, 1984) to six family business case studies to highlight how directors act as resource providers for their firms by utilising their personal experiences, judgement, external connections and access to information. We argue that there is a relationship between director diversity (demographic and cognitive), behaviour and roles, including those related to succession planning, that contributes to the ability of family businesses to survive and prosper.

This study examines the link between the political connections and financial performance of companies in Brazil and Canada, taking into account the moderating role of their country institutional factors. The authors use a comparative analysis of the largest listed companies in the two countries between 2010 and 2017 inclusive. There were four main results: (a) no significant difference was noted in the number of politically connected firms, although Brazilian companies were more politically connected on average than Canadian companies; a significant difference was noted between Brazil and Canada in terms of the number of politically connected directors and executive officers; (b) a significant and positive link emerged in both countries between political connections and firm performance, as measured by ROIC and ROA; (c) distinguishing between the political connections of directors and those of officers, a more significant positive association with performance was noticed in the latter; (d) most important, a clear and significant moderating role played by their country institutional factors was not apparent in the relationship between firms' political connections and performance. These latter results are mainly due to the lack of significant difference between the two countries in the number of politically connected firms. Contrary to expectations (and those of previous studies examining multicountry samples), the same effects from corporate political connections were shown in both countries. The study makes two important contributions. First, political connections seem to have become stronger than governance and institutional mechanisms, when it comes to controlling the behaviour of big corporations. Political connections have become so important that they influence the firm's management structure, whatever the institutional context; they seem to transcend governance mechanisms. Second, this study is among the first to demonstrate the need for investigating political connections at different firm levels; it shows the specific effect of political connections through executive officers rather than only through boards of directors, as is usually done.

This paper contributes empirically to the debate on who should nominate new directors: shareholders or the board? While nomination committees composed of incumbent board members are common around the world, the use of nomination committees composed of shareholders (SNBs) is recommended in several Nordic countries. We use the unique case of Finland as a quasi-experiment to examine the relation between the type of nomination procedure and board turnover. We find that firms with SNBs have boards with shorter average tenure, and fewer long-serving directors. We also find evidence suggesting a higher turnover performance sensitivity in the case of SNB firms: the average board tenure is more strongly related to firm performance in the case of SNB firms, and the relation between board tenure and the presence of experienced directors is more related to performance in SNB firms. In all, our results support the claim that SNBs might be useful tools to turn around board structures and tie individual director's performance to company performance.

In this study, I examine the role racial minorities in the boardroom can play in reducing social injustice by promoting more equal access to mortgage credit to minority households. I develop a simple theoretical model that posits directors who are racial minorities provide the credit unions they govern with a perspective that shapes lenders' trust of minority applicants. This trust is shaped by homophily and the tendency of individuals to prefer interactions with similar individuals. Using mortgage loan data from a cross-section of credit unions in the United States from 185,446 applications, I find that credit unions where the majority of board members are minorities are less likely to reject a similarly qualified minority applicant than their counterparts. Governance by minority directors significantly reduces the effects of discrimination faced by minority applicants. The board's effect is strongest in minority neighborhoods and where the homophily is stronger between directors and applicants. (c) The Author(s) 2021.
