A continuous non-limiting soil water supply, or a non-limiting supply from 120 to 180 days after planting, significantly increased (P = 0.01) female flower production of banana cv Robusta compared with continuous soil water stress. Relieving stress after 120 days produced a significantly higher (P = 0.05) average number of female flowers per inflorescence than when adequate water was supplied throughout. Female flower production is positively correlated with the average growth rates at floral initiation and early floral differentiation and with the final pseudostem girth. © 1982, Cambridge University Press.

The yield, plant characteristics (pseudostem height and girth), and relative tolerance to bunch loss of 4 banana varieties (Musa AAA Group, Cavendish subgroup) were studied over 2 crops in the semi-arid subtropics at Carnarvon, Western Australia. The varieties were New Guinea Cavendish, Chinese Cavendish, Hsien.Jen Chiao, and the most widely grown Australian variety, Williams. The marketable yield of Williams was higher (P<0.05) than the mean of the other varieties in the parent crop (70.2 v. 50.7 t/ha) and ratoon 1 crop (65.8 v. 34.4 t/ha). This was the result of lower (P<0.05) bunch loss, about 41% less over the 2 crops, than for the other varieties. Resistance to bunch loss-pseudostem breakage and bunch peduncle snap was not associated with the shorter varieties (New Guinea Cavendish and Chinese Cavendish), but resistance to choke throat was associated with the taller varieties (Williams and Hsien Jen Chiao). © 1992 ASEG.

The influence of windbreak shading was investigated over the plant crop (P) and first ratoon (R1) cycle of bananas cv. Dwarf Cavendish, to quantify its effects on assimilation, phenology and yield in the subtropics. Plants growing under seasonal windbreak shading (late autumn to early spring) were compared with those growing under full sun but under similar windbreak protection. Windbreak shading reduced average photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) by 69%, which in turn reduced photosynthesis rate by 27%, transpiration rate by 38% and stomatal conductance by 40% compared with plants growing in full sun. Pseudostem temperature was 2.1 K lower on plants growing in shade. This led to a reduction in monthly leaf emergence rate and an extended cycle time. An additional extension to cycle time was caused by the extra 3.4 leaves produced before flowering on plants growing under windbreak shading. The decreased photosynthesis of leaves growing in shade was partially compensated for in the P cycle by an extended flowering to harvest interval, resulting in no loss of bunch mass. However, bunch mass was significantly reduced in the R1 cycle, when flower to harvest intervals were similar. The most significant effect of windbreak shading was therefore a cumulative 10.6% extension in cycle time over the two crop cycles. The effect of a longer cycle and reduced bunch mass in the R1, caused by windbreak shading, resulted in an overall reduction of 13% in annual yield per ha, compared with plants growing in full sun.

The absorption of the nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S) by banana (Musa sp.) cv. Prata Anã explants on the basic medium of Murashige & Skoog (1962) supplemented with sucrose (30 g/L) and BAP (3.5 mg/L) were evaluated at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 days after inoculation. The seven treatments were arranged on a completely randomized design with three replicates. The sequence of nutrient absorption by the explants was K > N > Ca ≥ P > Mg ≅ S. The P was the nutrient with the fastest absorption rate and at the 30th day the explants had already absorbed 75% of the P from the medium. The P absorption stopped by the 50th day. The S absorption stopped at the 50th day with 66% of it remaining in the medium. The results suggested a close relationship between these two nutrients. The highest rates of nutrient absorption were observed during the first 20 days of culture. The rhizome, pseudostem and leaves behaved differently to the extraction and accumulation of nutrients.

The absorption of the micronutrients B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn by banana (Musa sp.) cultivar "Prata Anã" explants on the basic medium of Murashige & Skoog supplemented with BAP (3.5 mg/L) and sucrose (30 g/L) were evaluated at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 days after the inoculation. The experiment was arranged on a completely randomized design with three replications. Concentration of the micronutrients in the medium and in dry matter of the whole propagule and in the rhizome, pseudostem and leaves was also evaluated. Absorption of Mn was approximately constant during all the period of the experiment, while the other micronutrients had their higher absorption observed on the first 20 days. At the end of the experiment concentrations of B, Zn, Mn and Cu in the medium were 52, 61, 77 and 78%, respectively. These results point out that it is possible to reduce the concentration of these micronutrients on the basic medium MS for banana explants culture.

The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development. Host plant resistance offers another promising avenue of control. Numerous resistant clones are known, including Yangambi-km 5, Calcutta 4, and Pisang awak. Resistance is most often through antibiosis resulting in egg or larval failure. Banana breeding is a slow and difficult process. Current research is exploring genetic improvement through biotechnology techniques including the introduction of foreign genes. Neem has also shown potential for control of banana weevil. Studies on the use of other botanicals against banana weevil have failed to produce positive results. Chemical control of banana weevil remains a common and effective method for larger scale producers but is beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers. However, the weevil has displayed the ability to develop resistance against a broad range of chemicals. In summary, cultural control remains the most available approach for resource-poor farmers. A combination of several cultural methods is likely to reduce weevil pressure. Among the methods currently under study, microbial control, host plant resistance and neem appear to offer the most promise.

In an attempt to explain the difference in banana (Musa AAA cv. Grand Naine) plants with poor, regular, and good development, their root stratification and spatial distribution was determined in Costa Rican field conditions. Samples were taken from soil blocks at 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm distances from the pseudostem, and at every 15cm depth, from 0 to 120cm in non-flowering plants that were 180-190cm high. The plant development sites did affect the proportion of fresh thick roots (> 5 mm-d) as follows: 49, 63, and 56% in plants with poor, regular, and good development, respectively. The lateral distribution of thick and fine (1 to 5mm-d) roots and root hairs was affected by the horizontal distance from the pseudostem. The total percentage of roots decreased as horizontal distance increased in any plant development. Soil depth affected the distribution of every flesh root type throughout the soil profile. The total fresh root weight in the excavated area (0-90 cm from the pseudostem and 0-120cm depth) was 0.95, 0.9, and 0.76kg, for poor, regular, and good developed plants, respectively. Therefore, the explanation for regular and good plants more likely was the depth of the root system, which reached up to 120cm deep, while in the poor plants the roots reached only 75 cm deep. Additional studies that relate the root stratification with crop yield are encouraged.

Introduction. A project was undertaken to study the nutrient cycling from Musa mother plants to daughter suckers based on the physiological stages of the mother plant. It also reports on the dependency or competition at critical stages of flowering and fruiting and the combinations of different densities and sucker retention at different physiological stages of the mother plant. Materials and methods. A combination of three spacings and five sucker retention phases formed 15 treatments. 32P was given through injection into the mother plant pseudostem. The experiment was carried out over two years, the first being a rain-fed crop and the second being under irrigated conditions. Results. Differential aspects of nutrient cycling were observed between rain-fed and irrigated crops with regard to spacing. In the case of sucker retention phases, in the first year, it was retention at fruit maturity, shooting and flower bud differentiation stages which showed higher radioactivity recovery whereas, in the second year, it was the early phases of retention which showed significantly higher recovery. In the case of interaction effects, in the first year, the highest recovery was found in various combinations of spacing with the stages of bud initiation and shooting and, in the second year, the maximum recovery observed was in the combination of the closest spacing with the stage of flower bud initiation. In both years, recovery was observed in the border row plants. Conclusion. The study confirmed that activity extruded out from the treated plant and was absorbed by the border plants, revealing that nutrient sharing takes place in banana. This result opens up another concept that banana recommendation should not only be at an individual plant level but at block or plot level also. Hastening and improving the efficiency of nutrient cycling to the sucker is suggested as a future line of investigation. © 2002 Cirad/EDP Sciences.

Introduction. A study was done to compare Gruesa, a local dwarf Cavendish selection, with two other cultivars of the Cavendish subgroup in the open air or under greenhouse conditions in two localities of the Canary Islands. Materials and methods. The trials were set up with the cultivars Zelig, Grande Naine and Gruesa in four plots on the northern slope: one outdoors and three under three different greenhouse covers (one with polyethylene lamina and the other two with different types of mesh), and in one outdoor plot on the southern slope of the island of Tenerife. Morphological, phenological and production characteristics were studied over three productive cycles. Results. Significant differences were found in both plant height (Grande Naine > Zelig > Gruesa) and pseudostem thickness (Gruesa > Grande Naine = Zelig). Each cultivar showed a stable [height:thickness] ratio, remaining the same in all trial conditions. Gruesa cycle length was longer than those of the other two cultivars, emitting more leaves until bunch emergency. Gruesa produced the most hands per bunch and the most fingers per hand. In all cultivars, finger length was directly related to pseudostem height. All three cultivars produced well, with fruits very similar in organoleptic traits. A reduction in cycle length and a slight increase in productivity were observed in the northern plot under the polyethylene cover compared with the plots under other covers and outdoors. Conclusion. Gruesa appears more recommendable than Zelig and Grande Naine for open-air plantations in windy localities. © 2005 Cirad/EDP Sciences. All rights reserved.

Sterility has profound effects on the development of reproductive tissues in members of the Musaceae and limits genetic improvement required to deal with new diseases. Ovules of seeded diploid Musa acuminata (AA) and edible triploids (AAA) from the same cytogenetic group, plus edible triploids containing genomes of the M. balbisiana cytogenetic group (AAB, ABB) and the related genus Ensete sp. were studied to determine the effects of sterility on the growth and development of the ovule and its tissues. Specimens were collected from subtropical and Mediterranean environments in Australia. At anthesis, the ovules of triploid plants were 36% larger than the ovules of diploid plants. The diploid ovules ceased growth shortly after the inflorescence emerged from the pseudostem. In contrast, the triploid ovules continued to grow 7-10 days past anthesis, increasing in size by 70%. All ovules of diploid M. acuminata ssp. had an embryo sac at anthesis, against 97% for triploids. At anthesis the embryo sacs in diploid ovules occupied 2.7% of the nucellus compared with 1.5% in triploid ovules. The embryo sacs did not grow between bunch emergence and anthesis, once formed they maintained the same size. Many embryo sacs were not positioned correctly, flush with the nucellar cap. The diploid M. acuminata ssp. had 75% of embryo sacs correctly positioned against 10% in the edible triploids. The proportion of balbisiana genome (B) did not affect ovule or nucellus size or shape, or cell number across the nucellus. It increased the embryo sac presence 96-100% of ovules. The sterile edible triploid bananas have embryo sacs at anthesis but many are incorrectly positioned, which may contribute to their sterility. The balbisiana genome in the edible triploids was associated with a 2.4-fold increase in the number of correctly positioned embryo sacs and this may contribute to the increased fertility associated with the B genome. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of weed management on banana (Musa AAA cv. Grande Naine) parasitic nematodes was evaluated under Costa Rican field conditions with special reference to their spatial distribution and the damage caused to roots of different thickness classes and their relation to yield losses. Root samples were taken at plant harvest, from soil blocks at 0-30,30-60 and 60-90 cm from the pseudostem, and at every 15 cm depth, from 0 to 120 cm. Weed management neither affected the nematode numbers nor their horizontal and vertical distribution and associated root damage. Differences in Radopholus similis (P<0.0001), Helicotylenchus spp. (P=0.0115) and total nematode populations (P<0.0001) were found in roots of different thickness. The average populations in thick, thin and fine roots were for R. similis 270,666 (57%), 120,401 (25%) and 11,313 (2%); for Helicotylenchus spp. 36,094 (7%), 22,508 (5%) and 8,824 (2%); and total nematodes 390,425 (65%), 145,534 (31%) and 21,177 (4%), respectively. No linear correlations were found between bunch weight and the number and density of nematodes or with their damage. Even though, no statistical difference was found in bunch weight, the manual weed control plot yielded 1.4 kg heavier bunches, which might have important implications for sustainable agriculture. The implementation of weed control by hand chopping may improve the physical, chemical and biological soil properties and reduce soil erosion, temperature fluctuations, evaporation rate, and nutrient leaching, and increase water infiltration. As a consequence of the decrease in herbicide applications, soil and air pollution might be reduced. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In order to identify the effect of burrowing nematodes on the shoots (pseudostem and leaves) of banana plants and to determine whether or not shoot characteristics are associated with plant resistance to nematodes two experiments were conducted in controlled conditions within polytunnels. The banana plants were harvested on three occasions for the measurement of root morphology and biomass. Varieties differed in their resistance to nematodes from resistant (Yg Km5, FHIA 17, FHIA 03) and partly resistant (FHIA 01, FHIA 25) to not resistant (FHIA 23, Williams). Nematodes reduced total plant dry weight at the first harvest in Experiment 1 and by an average of 8.8% in Experiment 2, but did not affect leaf area in either experiment. The ratio of above-ground weight to total plant weight was reduced from 75% to 72% in nematode-infected plants compared with the control plants for all varieties tested in Experiment 1, but was only reduced in FHIA 25 and FHIA 23 in Experiment 2. Varieties differed in above-ground growth. The FHIA varieties had greater shoot weights and leaf area than YgKm5 and Williams. Overall, resistance to nematodes was associated with the partitioning of a greater proportion of biomass to the roots than to above-ground parts. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

Field experiments were conducted in Oahu, Hawaii, to investigate the effects of banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) infection on growth and morphology of banana (Musa acuminata). The time interval between aphid inoculation of BBTV and the initial appearance of disease symptoms (i.e. incubation period) was also determined. Plants infected with BBTV showed a significant reduction in petiole size (i.e. length and distance), plant canopy and height, leaf area, pseudostem diameter and chlorophyll content compared with control plants. Growth differences between virus-infected and control plants were not observed until 40-50 days after the plants were inoculated with viruliferous aphids. Other growth parameters such as petiole width and leaf production were not statistically different between infected and control plants. The incubation period of banana bunchy top disease or appearance of symptoms ranged from 25 to 85 days after aphid inoculation. However, PCR assays provided earlier detection of BBTV in banana plants compared with visual symptoms. © 2008 The Authors.

The results of research on the water relations and irrigation need of banana are collated and summarised in an attempt to link fundamental studies on crop physiology to irrigation practices. Background information on the ecology of the banana and crop development processes, with emphasis on root growth and water uptake, is presented, followed by reviews of the influence of water stress on gas exchange (stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration), crop water use, and yield. Emphasis is placed on research that has international relevance and, where appropriate, three geographical areas (the tropics, subtropics and Mediterranean climates) are considered. Although roots can extend to depths of 1.0-1.5 m, the effective depth of rooting is usually taken to be 0-0.40 m, sometimes extending to 0.60 m. Stomatal conductance is a sensitive measure of soil water availability and plant water status, whilst transpiration rates can be limited by dry air (saturation deficits &gt;2.0 kPa). In the subtropics, there are seasonal differences in the crop coefficient (Kc) with values ranging from 0.6 in the winter months to about 1.0 Epan in the summer. It is difficult to draw generic conclusions with wide applicability from the irrigation experiments as they were reported. All the components of marketable yield can be enhanced by irrigation whilst applying insufficient water delays crop development. Annual yield responses to irrigation are variable, but water use efficiencies of 40 kg ha-1 mm-1 (fresh fruit/water applied) have been achieved in the tropics and subtropics (and elsewhere up to 80 kg ha-1 mm-1 with partial replacement of the soil water deficit). To ensure large yields of (marketable) fruit, soil water deficits must be kept low (Ψm &gt;-20 kPa at 0.2 m depth). In the subtropics, this means irrigation intervals should not exceed 2-3 d during the summer. The cooling effect of irrigation with micro-sprinklers on the soil and pseudostem temperatures, compared with drippers, can delay crop development and reduce annual yields by 30%. There is some (limited) evidence that the presence of the B genome contributes to drought tolerance. Yield response factors to irrigation for different growth stages have yet to be confirmed. Opportunities to improve the water productivity of the many, diverse banana cultivars need to be explored further. © Cambridge University Press 2009.

The banana tree demands large quantities of fertilizers to maintain its nutritional requirements and achieve high productivity, but large percentage applied are not available, since it gets lost mainly by fixation, leaching and volatilization. The objective of this study was to evaluate the rate of remobilization and repartition of nutrients in banana tree, cultivar Thap Maeo, cultivated in the Western Amazon. The results showed that the highest proportion of K, Na, Mg, S, B, Cu, Fe and Zn was found in the pseudostem. The remaining flowers represent a strong drain of nutrients. The biomass that comes from the culture residues represents a significant source of nutrients. The nutrient remobilization index was higher with N and K. The inverse was observed with Fe and Mn.

Banana, an important fruit crop, requires high amounts of N-fertilizers for commercial cultivation. This, however, is costly and can be hazardous to the soil environment when used excessively. Biofertilizer is globally accepted as an alternative source of N-fertilizer and can substantially supplement the N requirement while enhancing the uptake of water and mineral nutrients of crop plants. An experiment was conducted to observe the effect of plant growth promoting rhizobacterial inoculation on growth, nutrient uptake of bananas grown under hydroponics condition. The design of the experiment was randomized complete block with five replicates. The following six treatments were imposed: T1 (control; N0-PGPR), T2: (N0+Sp7), T3: (N0+ UPMB10), T4: (N 33%+ Sp7), T5: (N33% + UPMB10), and T 6: (N100%-PGPR). The results showed that inoculation by UPMB10 with minimal fertilizer-N supply increased (P &lt; 0.05) the primary root elongation and secondary root initiation and subsequently increased (P &lt; 0.05) the root biomass. The same treatment also increased (P &lt; 0.05) N concentration in pseudostem and leaves and Ca concentration in roots. The total accumulation of N, P, K, Ca and Mg were increased due to inoculation; a consequence of increased plant growth. Plants with this treatment produced an equivalent total dry matter as those supplied with 100% N. © 2009 Academic Journals.

Under some cultivation conditions, excessive growth of the pseudostem of banana plants can be considered a limiting factor, and thus, the use of growth regulators can constitute a valid alternative. This work aimed to evaluate the action of paclobutrazol on the growth of the pseudostem of banana plants and other characteristics of their development. An experiment was installed with five paclobutrazol doses (0; 0.5; 1.0; 1.5; and 2.0 g of a.i. plant-1) combined with two banana plant cultivars ('Prata Anã' and 'FHIA-01'). Paclobutrazol did not affect the number of days from planting to flowering, total leaf area and leaf emission rate. However, it increased leaf permanence on the plants and sucker number, reduced the foliar area of the leaves emitted after its application and provided an average reduction in pseudostem height of 26%.

To estimate the demand of micronutrients for the banana plants (Musa spp.), it is essential to know the amounts of dry matter and micronutrients accumulated in the plant and exported by the bunch. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accumulation of dry matter and micronutrients by six banana varieties under irrigation. Plants of Grande Naine, Pacovan, Pacovan- Apodi, Prata-Anã, Terrinha and Gross Michel varieties grown in double rows, with a density equivalent to 1,666 plants per hectare were sampled. At harvest four plants of each variety were selected for sampling of mother-plant, which was divided into rhizome, pseudostem, petiole, leaf blade, stalk and fruits. The plant parts were weighed to determine the fresh weight of each part and a sample of about 700 g of each part was collected to determine dry weight and contents of micronutrients. The samples were washed quickly with tap water and later with distilled water and placed in a greenhouse for pre-drying and afterwards conditioned in paper bags were put in an oven of forced circulation of air for obtaining the dry matter and subsequent determination of the contents of B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn. The varieties Pacovan, Prata Anã e Pacovan Apodi accumulated greater amounts of dry matter and micronutrients, when compared to the varieties Grande Naine, Gross Michel e Terrinha, observing the following decreasing order of accumulation and export of micronutrients: Mn > Fe > B > Zn > Cu.

A field experiment was conducted during 2005-07 to find out the relationship between pseudostem cross-sectional area (PCA) with bunch weight, physico-chemical characteristics of banana fruit, dry matter and nutrient content in leaf, pseudostem and fruit of banana. The pseudostem cross-sectional area (321.58, 327.96, 338.31, 344.20, 348.82, 354.14, 365.57, 376.49, 386.18 and 396.70 cm2) were calculated at 30 cm above the ground level. The bunch weight and physico-chemical properties of fruits improved with increasing the pseudostem cross sectional area from 321.58 to 396.70 cm2. Maximum bunch weight (13.22 kg), number of hands and finger (8.2 and 104.65/bunch), TSS (24.97 °Brix), TSS/acid ratio (227.00); leaf, fruit and pseudostem dry matter content (30.50, 27.58 and 9.42% respectively), leaf nutrient content (N-2.21%, P-0.21% and K-2.04% respectively), fruit nutrient (N-1.16%, P-0.079% and K-1.23% respectively) and pseudostem nutrient content (N-0.66%, P-0.042% and K-1.16%) were recorded in plants with maximum pseudostem cross sectional area. Positive and linear relationship were recorded between pseudostem cross-sectional area and bunch weight, number of fingers, TSS and TSS/acid ratio, whereas negative correlation was observed between pseudostem cross-sectional area and fresh and ripe finger weight, peel and pulp weight and fruit acidity. The maximum fresh and ripe finger weight (152.23 and 137.45 g/finger), peel and pulp weight (18.24 and 119.21 g/finger), finger size (14.75 × 4.38 cm) and titratable acidity (0.16%) were recorded with lowest trunk cross-sectional area.

Banana, irrespective of the varieties, respond very well to the applied nutrients and water, especially at the vegetative stage. Although the crop shows vigorous dry matter production in the early stages of growth, the proportion of dry matter partitioning to reproductive growth is inadequate. Most of the dry matter confines to the pseudostem and foliage resulting in poor bunch size, reduced number of fruits and low fruit quality. In the present study, different levels of nutrients were applied to banana 'Robusta' and treatments were as follows: 150:50:150 g NPK plant-1 (M1), 200:50:200 g NPK plant -1 (M2), 250:50:250 g NPK plant-1 (M3) and 300:50:300 g NPK plant-1 (M4) per year as soil application. Bunch treatments comprising spraying of brassinolides 2 ppm (S1), CPPU [1-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-3- phenylurea] 4 ppm (S2), 2,4-D 10 ppm (S3), 0.5% KH2PO4 (S4), 0.5% KNO3 (S5), 0.5% K2SO4 (S6) and dehanding (retaining six hands in a bunch) apart from soil applied nutrients, were also taken up. The experiments conducted in the plant crop revealed that soil application of 300:50:300 g NPK plant-1 and bunch spray of CPPU 4 ppm immediately after last hand opening and 15 days after (M4S2) resulted in heavier bunch (26.2 kg). The estimated fruit yield was 65.50 t/ha in M4S2 with high B:C ratio of 2.62. The improvement in bunch weight and quality parameters might be due to the spraying of chemicals on bunches combined with the increased dose of N and K application. The growth parameters and physiological characters such as soluble protein and chlorophyll content of leaves at the stage of flowering showed significant difference between different levels of fertilizers (M) but not between the bunch spray (S) treatments. However, significant differences were observed in the interaction effects of M and S. Application of 300:50:300 g NPK plant-1 and bunch spray of CPPU 4 ppm immediately after last hand opening and 15 days after (M4S2) resulted in higher TSS (23 °B) and reduced titrable acidity (0.32%), apart from higher bunch weight.

This chapter describes the morphology of the musa plant and discusses the potential benefits of morphological diversity. The East African Highland bananas, also considered as the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, display a very variable pseudostem color, the intensity of which varies with environmental conditions. Thus, in the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, the pseudostem and leaf petioles tend to get darker as altitude increases. Leaf pigmentation and posture may affect photosynthetic efficiency and transpiration rates as described by Brun and Turner, but there are surprisingly not many recent studies relating leaf morphology to photosynthetic efficiency or transpiration of the existing cultivars. Continued elongation of the main stalk of the inflorescence causes the bunch to hang over, the bracts open and fall, disclosing the female flower clusters or hands. The female flowers undergo further development without being pollinated or fertilized. A comprehensive study of the root system of a wider gene pool is required to construct an ideotype target for genetic improvement of plantains and bananas. © 2011 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Musa spp. is one of the most important fruit crops in the world. Production in Mexico is ranked in the eighth place in the world. Nutrient imbalance is one of the main agronomic problems this species has to deal with. Modern fertilization programs must be designed based on nutrient demand by the cultivated plants, and according to their phenological phase. However, no information is available for 'Dominico', one of the most widespread cultivars in Mexico. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate dry mass and macronutrient accumulation and distribution in banana 'Dominico' during the fruit development phase. This is to determine the amount and timing of fertilizer application. Adult plants were randomly selected in a banana orchard established in Atzalán, Veracruz, México. Root, corm, pseudostem, leaves with petiole, and the bunch were sampled at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after inflorescence emergence (WAIE) on these plants. Samples were processed, and biomass accumulation and N, P, K, Ca, and Mg concentration were determined. Pseudostem was the plant part with the highest dry mass and nutrient accumulation. Potassium was the most extracted nutrient by the plant and the fruit. The sequence for total nutrient extraction per plant was: K > Ca > N > Mg > P. Fruit extraction sequence was: K>N>Ca≥P≥Mg. The highest nutrient extraction was detected at 4 WAIE. The quantity of mineral nutrients that would have to be replenished into the soil will be those extracted by the bunches because they are removed from the plantation. It is recommended that fertilizer applications be split up to the 2 WAIE. This is to guarantee nutrient supply by the 4 WAIE so that an optimum fruit and daughter plant development could be achieved.

Banana is one of the most important food items in the Philippines, ranked fourth among food crops after rice, wheat and maize and being first among fruits. High yield of banana plantations requires enormous amount of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.This study was conducted to determine the potential of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and nitrogen fixing bacteria (NFB) biofertilizers as growth promoters and biological control agents against nematodes in tissue-cultured banana var. Lakatan under screen house conditions. Meriplants were inoculated with AMF (Mykovam™) and NFB (Bio-N™) during planting in individual plastic bags filled with sterile soil sand mixture. Plant parasitic nematodes, Radopholus similis and Meloidogyne incognita suspension were poured into the soil, two months after inoculation with biofertilizers at concentrations of 1,000 and 5,000 larvae or eggs per seedling, respectively. Plant height, pseudostem diameter and leaf area were taken every 2 weeks. At fourth month, the plants were harvested and extent of damage due to nematodes and the number of colony forming units of NFB were determined. Results show that AMF and AMF+NFB inoculated seedlings grew better than the control plants. AMF treated plants were taller, had bigger pseudostem diameter, larger leaf area, highest fine, coarse root and total plant dry weights than the control and the other treatments. Growth of plants infectedwith R. similis alone was comparable with M. incognita and the control. M. incognita-infected plants had numerous root galls. Root necrosis were observed only in R. similis-infected plants. AMF reduced root galls by 33% relative to those inoculated with M. incognita. Percent mycorrhizal colonization was not affected by either NFB or the nematodes. The roots of AMF+NFB gave the highest bacterial colony count (8±1.02 × 10 4 ) which was reduced by AMF+NFB+R. similis (5±0.80 × 10 3 ) and the lowest was with AMF+NFB+ M. incognita (5± 0.50 × 10 3 ). This implies that M. incognita and R. similis reduced the NFB bacterial colonies.

The objective of the present study was to estimate the phenotypic correlations between the number of fruits per bunch and 22 characters evaluated in banana (AA) diploid hybrids. The experiment was carried out at Embrapa Cassava and Fruits in randomized blocks with four repetitions and 11 (AA) banana diploid hybrids were evaluated. The following characteristics were evaluated: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of suckers, number of leaves during flowering, plant cycle until emission of the bunch, presence of pollen, bunch and rachis weight, yellow Sigatoka at bunch emission, number of leaves at harvest, yellow Sigatoka at bunch harvest, number of days from emission to harvest, length and diameter of stem, weight of second hand, number of hands and fruits per bunch, pedicellum fragility, length and diameter of fruit and length of pedicellum and presence of seeds. Correlation studies between the number of fruits and the other plant characteristics were carried out. These correlations varied between genotypes; therefore, it was observed that the associations between number of fruits and vegetative characteristics of plants were, in general, non-significant. However, the relationships between the number of fruits per bunch and the other production characteristics were predominantly significant.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the response of irrigated 'Prata Anã' banana (AAB) to soil application of phosphorus, in four production cycles. The experiment was carried out in the semiarid region of the north of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in a clayey Oxisol, with very low available P (4.6 mg dm-3, Mehlich). A randomized complete block design was used, in a 5x4 factorial arrangement, with five doses of triple superphosphate (0, 50, 100, 200, and 300 g P2O5 per plant per year), four production cycles, and four replicates. In the first cycle, the soil application of P increased plant height, pseudostem diameter, weight and number of fruits per bunch of banana; however, banana plants did not respond to P application in the second, third, and fourth cycles. 'Prata Anã' banana, even when grown in soil with low P content, responds to the application of this nutrient only in the first production cycle.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of different water depths on the morphophysiological and yield variables of three Terra-type banana cultivars. A randomized complete block design was used, in a factorial arrangement with 12 treatments and three replicates. Treatments consisted of water depths correspondent to 33, 66, 99, and 120% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc), besides the control without irrigation, and of the cultivars Terra Maranhão, Terrinha, and D'Angola. The morphophysiological variables evaluated were: plant height, pseudostem diameter, leaf area, stomatal conductance, and, during harvest, the number of fingers and hands, and hand weight per bunch. Crop coefficients of the Terra-type banana cultivars were obtained from the best combination of yield and water use efficiency. The consumptive water-use depths of 1,599 mm (1.20 ETc), 922 mm (0.84 ETc), and 940 mm (1.06 ETc) correspond to the maximum yields and water use efficiencies of the cultivars Terra Maranhão, Terrinha, and D'Angola, respectively.

Dessert banana production worldwide is based on just a few highly productive, easy to grow and international market compatible cultivars from the Cavendish sub-group (AAA genome). However, these cultivars are hampered by pests and diseases, which has led to extensive pesticide use. New pest and disease resistant varieties that are productive enough to meet international market demand are now needed to reduce pesticide use and thus the detrimental environmental impact. Hybrid bananas bred by the CIRAD banana breeding program are resistant to many diseases, particularly Sigatoka diseases, but exhibit morphological traits and yield components which differ markedly from those of Cavendish bananas. After an analysis of traits related to plant morphology and yield in 530 banana hybrids, the effects of modifying the level of competition between bunches and suckers through sucker pruning management practices were compared on the new hybrid CIRAD 925 and on a reference variety from the Cavendish sub-group ‘Grande Naine’. Hybrids from the CIRAD banana breeding program tend to have thin stems, small bunches and a short crop cycle. Total sucker pruning until mother plant harvest significantly increased the fruit diameter, first cycle bunch weight, second cycle duration and decreased the plant size. However, the effect on bunch weight was greater for Grande Naine, while the effects on second cycle duration and pseudostem girth were greater for CIRAD 925. The level of apical dominance of the central meristem on suckers seemed to explain the varietal differences in the effects of sucker pruning management. Our results showed that traits related to plant morphology and yield components could be modified by sucker pruning management and that a tailored management of mother-plant/sucker competition could be a way to improve the suitability of new hybrids for the banana industry. © 2016

A field experiment was conducted to assess the nutrient uptake pattern and partitioning of nutrients in Ney Poovan banana (AB) at critical growth stages like 10-leaf stage, 20-leaf stage, shooting stage and harvesting stage. From 10-leaf stage to harvesting, the per cent dry matter (DM) accumulation decreased from 42 to 16 in underground segment and increased from 58 to 84 in above ground segment. The sample was partitioned into root, corm, pseudostem, leaf lamina, petiole, peduncle, bunch and male bud, processed and analysed for macro and micronutrients at different critical growth stages. The nutrient accumulation pattern, with respect to dry matter production was worked out. To produce 37.5 t banana ha-1, about 444 kg N, 69 kg P, 933 kg K, 2.4 kg Cu, 7.3 kg Mn, 3.4 kg Fe and 5.9 kg Zn were taken up by Ney Poovan banana. About 10 to 52% removal occurred through bunch harvest from the total nutrient uptake from the soil and remaining nutrients accumulated in the residual tissues were available for in situ recycling. The data provided opportunity for proper fertiliser scheduling to achieve optimum yield with higher nutrient use efficiency and nutrient budgeting in banana ecosystem was also done. © 2018, Horticulture Society of India.

The severity of Fusarium wilt of bananas has long been classified based on visual assessment of necrosis in rhizome or pseudostem cross-sections. The improved method proposed here uses digital image analysis to quantify the proportion of rhizome tissue that is necrotic. It agrees well with visual classification, but provides greater reproducibility, precision and statistical power. © 2019, Australasian Plant Pathology Society Inc.

A field investigation was carried out to study the influence of potassium on growth, yield and quality of Hill banana var. Sirumalai" at Sirumalai hills in Dindugul district during the year 2016-2018. The experiment was laid out in a randomized block design with nine treatments replicated thrice. The treatments included graded levels of K (@ 390g as control, 450g, 500g, 550g and 600 g/plant) and foliar spray of Sulphate of Potash (SOP @1.5 % twice at 15 days interval after bunch emergence along with four levels of K excluding control). The growth, flowering and quality parameters were periodically observed. In general, increase in graded level of K application has enhanced the growth and yield parameters. Treatments with foliar application of SOP showed significant influence when compared with soil application of K alone. Further, the results revealed that the growth characters viz., pseudostem height, pseudostem girth, number of leaves per plant were favorably enhanced by the combined application of K @ 550 g/plant + SOP foliar spray twice @ 1.5%, which was followed by K @ 600 gm/plant + SOP foliar spray twice @ 1.5%. The yield parameters viz., days to bunch harvest, number of fingers per bunch, number of hands per bunch, weight of second hand per bunch, total number of fingers in second hand per bunch, bunch weight and estimated yield were also found to be influenced by foliar application of K. Among the treatments application of K @ 550 gm/plant + SOP foliar spray twice @ 1.5% recorded the maximum values for all above said characters. The quality parameters viz., middle finger length (cm) and middle finger diameter (cm) of the second hand, TSS and total sugars were also found to be influenced by foliar application of K. The results suggested that application K @ 550 gm/plant + SOP foliar spray @ 1.5% twice at 15 days interval after bunch emergence as the best treatment to increase yield and quality of Hill banana var.

Managing seasonal production variations is sometimes necessary for banana plantations. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a modified pruning, with selection of later successor suckers for the production units, on the growth, harvest time, and bunch weight of 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana plants, when compared to conventional pruning. A completely randomized experimental design was used, with two treatments and ten replicates for the conduction of two experiments, one for each cultivar. The treatments consisted of conventional pruning and modified pruning (selection of later successor suckers). Conventional pruning was carried out maintaining the successor sucker (daughter plant), whose growth was evaluated until the flowering stage. Modified pruning was carried out with the removal of the successor sucker (daughter plant) after the flowering of the mother plant, and the subsequent successor sucker (granddaughter plant) was selected and grown as the daughter plant. The growth of the first and second suckers were quantified at intervals of approximately 60 days and the bunch weight and other production variables were determined. The pruning reduced the height and pseudostem perimeter of the first successor sucker and delayed the harvest time in at least 30 days without reducing bunch weight of both banana cultivars. The mean yields were 26.68 and 50.64 Mg ha-1for the 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana, respectively, regardless of the pruning management used. The second sucker of 'Nanica' banana presented a residual effect of the pruning on plant height, but not on production. The use of the modified pruning is feasible for changing harvest time of both cultivars. However, repeatedly use of this technique for the same production unit is not recommended, since it affects the h eight of the second successor sucker. © 2021 Federal University ofPiauI.

The performance of the crop plant and the 'ratoon' plant (lateral shoot succeeding the harvested main shoot) of 65 medium-sized False Horn plantains (Musa cv. AAB) was studied by measuring vegetative and inflorescence (bunch) parameters. From significant regressions between different parameters it appears that taller pseudostems produce leaves at a faster rate, flower earlier and produce heavier infructescences which need more time to mature. A high yield is determined by vigorous initial growth of the planted sucker (lateral root). Before flowering, there is no sink competition between ratoon and main pseudostem growth, and fast-growing main pseudostems are accompanied by fast-growing ratoons. After flowering, competition occurs between the fructifying inflorescence, a preferential sink and the ratoon. The results indicate that plantain should not be considered as an annual crop. © 1985 Annals of Botany Company.

Plantains (Musa spp., AAB group) are an important food crop and an integral component of the farming systems in the lowland humid forest zone of West and Central Africa. A group of 24 plantain cultivars, representing the major variability in West Africa, was evaluated for nine quantitative characters. The association between growth and yield parameters in this African plantain germplasm was examined to determine if the pattern of quantitative variation in inflorescence and vegetative traits agreed with taxonomic groupings based on inflorescence type and plant size. Phenotypic correlations between these traits were calculated. Giant cultivars were taller, their pseudostem thicker, and they flowered much later than medium-sized cultivars. Giant cultivars produced more foliage, resulting in heavier bunches with more hands and fruits. Groupings that resulted following principal component analysis (PCA) supported conventional taxonomic groupings of plantains. PC A was based mainly on time to flowering, pseudostem height, and number of fruits. The last two traits, in combination with the number of hermaphrodite flowers and the persistence of the male bud, sufficed to group plantain cultivars. © 1995 The New York Botanical Garden.

Musa cultivars (bananas and plantains) are important crops in the humid tropics of Africa, America and Asia. This paper reports the extent of morphological variation of the Musa germplasm maintained in the gene-bank of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in southeastern Nigeria. Qualitative and quantitative descriptors were used to evaluate AA, BB, AB, AAA, AAB, AAAA, AAAB and AABB bananas, AAA and ABB cooking bananas, AAA beer bananas and AAB plantains and a few wild species. Univariate and principal component (PCA) analyses were performed to identify the most important descriptors to characterize and classify Musa germplasm collections. The most important qualitative morphological descriptors were persistence of male bud and hermaphrodite flowers, pigmentation in pseudostem, foliage, petiole and male flower, pseudostem blotching and waxiness, and leaf orientation. Furthermore, the most important quantitative morphological descriptors included pseudostem girth, height of tallest sucker, number of fruits and fruit sizes. These quantitative descriptors have a high heritability (>0.8), high repeatibility (>2.0)and low coefficient of variation (9-15%) with the exception of the height of the tallest sucker. The implications of the germplasm grouping revealed by PCA are briefly discussed in relation to the evolution of the triploid cultivars. This paper also proposes a new scientific nomenclature for the triploid Musa cultivars.

Banana (Musa spp.) is a major semi-perennial fruit crop in Sri Lanka. A study was conducted at the Regional Agricultural Research and Development Centre, Angunakolapelessa to investigate the effect of age on growth and yield of banana cv Mysore ("Embul", AAB group). Thirty-seven "Embul" banana accessions collected from various ecological regions of Sri Lanka were studied in a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replicates. The observations were recorded in three consecutive years. Number of leaves per clump, LAI (leaf area index) and penetration of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to the crop were recorded at 4, 9, 20 and 32 months after planting. Pseudostem height and girth of the crop were investigated at different ages. Number of combs and fruits per comb, fruit maturity period, bunch weight, total fruit weight, average fruit weight and peduncle weight were also measured. Comb weight, fruit circumference, fruit length and diameter were recorded in the second and last combs. Leaf number and LAI increased, while penetration of PAR decreased with the age. Except weight of second comb, fruit length in second comb and fruit diameter in last comb, all other characteristics varied significantly with age of the crop. Fruit maturity period increased with the age of the crop to second year and then decreased, while total fruit weight decreased up to second year and then increased. Number of fruits per comb and bunch weight significantly increased after the second year. Stem height and girth, number of fruits per bunch, weight of the peduncle and length of the male axis consistently increased with the age of the crop investigated up to the third year.

Plantains exhibit great variability in West and Central Africa, which accounts for 60% of world production. Sixteen quantitative characteristics were evaluated in 75 plantain and 18 banana cultivars during several production cycles. The extent of variation in quantitative continuous characteristics and the phenotypic correlations between them were analysed. Index descriptors based on the combination of two characteristics were calculated. Despite the significant (P &lt; 0.05) influence of the environment and the genotype-by-environment interaction, most of the variation was significantly affected by the specific genotype of the Musa accessions. The most productive cultivars were the Cavendish bananas and the giant French plantains (&gt; 30 t ha-1 year-1). Five phenotypic correlations were common to all known taxonomic Musa groups. Short-cycling cultivars showed early flowering, whereas tall cultivars had wide plant girth and many leaves. The number of fruit per bunch was significantly associated with the number of hands (or nodal clusters of fruit). The most important component of yield potential was bunch weight in all Musa cultivars, and days to harvest only in the dessert bananas derived from interspecific crosses of M. acuminata. Index descriptors may be useful for selection of traits that are difficult to score or that show a high coefficient of variation. Short Musa cultivars may be selected by calculating the index of pseudostem condensation. A low value of pseudostem condensation (&lt; 9 cm leaf-1) was characteristic of known dwarf plantain and banana cultivars.

The distribution of roots in banana was determined on a sandy clay loam in Costa Rica. Samples were taken from soil blocks at distances of 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm from the pseudostem, 0 to 120 cm depth at intervals of 15 cm, and from plants that were 120, 150, 180 or 210 cm tall (non-flowering), plus a set from plants with emergent flower stalks. Plant height and the horizontal distance from the pseudostem did not affect the percentage of fresh root weight. In contrast, there was a significant effect of soil depth, and a significant interaction between soil depth x horizontal distance from the pseudostem, on the percentage of fresh root weight. For the three distances from the pseudostem, the percentage of root weight decreased sharply with soil depth. Independently of the distance from the pseudostem, all plants showed the highest root weight in the top 15 cm of soil. More than 65% of the total root weight was found in the upper 30 cm of soil. More than 79% and 88% of the roots were detected in the first 45 and 60 cm of the soil profile at any plant height, respectively. The total fresh root weight in the excavated area (0-90 cm from the pseudostem and 0-120 cm depth) was 1.16, 0.97, 1.14, 1.50, and 1.22 kg in the plant heights of 120, 150, 180 and 210 cm, and plants with emergent flower stalks, respectively. Additional studies of root stratification patterns are necessary for a better understanding of the interaction between cultural practices and crop yield.

Plant height and the horizontal distance from the pseudostem did not affect the percentage of fresh root weight. In contrast, there was a significant (P= 0.0001) effect of soil depth, and also a significant (P= 0.0006) interaction between soil depth and horizontal distance from the pseudostem, on the percentage of fresh root weight. For the three distances from the pseudostem, the percentage of root weight decreased sharply with soil depths. Independently of the distance from the pseudostem, all plants showed the highest root weight in the top 15 cm of the soil (40.1%).

Timing and distribution of attack on East African highland banana (Musa AAAEA) by the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) was studied in a field trial at a farm 25 km NE of Kampala, Uganda. Weevils were released at three densities (5, 20 and 40 females per mat) in 324 m2 banana plots (cv Atwalira) that had been established 18 months earlier and maintained relatively free of weevils. Two weeks after release, entire mats were removed and examined for weevil eggs and first instar larvae. At a density of 20 weevils per mat, oviposition occurred on 25% of plants less than 6 six months old (suckers) with an average of three eggs (range 0-16) per infested plant. At the same time, 85% of flowered plants were attacked with mean oviposition of 15 eggs (range 0-41) per plant. An inverse relationship existed between weevil population density and eggs/female/plant. Five females per mat produced an average of 7.2 eggs per flowered plant, whereas 20 females produced 15 eggs per flowered plant and 40 females produced 12.5 eggs. This suggests the existence of density-dependent factors in weevil oviposition. Over 90% of the oviposition occurred in the base of the pseudostem, with the remaining eggs found in the corm and roots near the soil surface. However, in stands displaying high mat, (a condition in which part of the corm appears above the soil surface) more eggs were found on the corm than pseudostem.

Between 1991 to 1996, more than 50 Musa hybrids and 10 landraces were evaluated under field and screenhouse conditions for virus symptoms resembling those caused by banana streak badnavirus (BSV). The symptoms included chlorotic streaks, leaf deformation, stunting, cigar leaf death, distortion of the peduncle, bunch or fruits, and internal pseudostem necrosis. Immunosorbent electron microscopy (ISEM) of randomly selected plants with one or more of these symptoms confirmed the presence of BSV particles in 15 tropical Musa plantain hybrids (TMPx) and five Musa landraces. Under both field and screenhouse conditions, the incidence of symptomatic plants in the hybrids was significantly higher than in the landraces. The hybrids also generally had a higher concentration of BSV antigens, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). By contrast, most BSV-infected landraces were symptomless and had very low or undetectable amounts of BSV antigens. There was a significant variation in incidence of symptomatic plants between genotypes, experiments and year of observation. These results are discussed in relation to the higher natural BSV incidence observed on some Musa hybrids as compared with their parental genotypes.

Plantain (Musa spp. AAB, French, cv. Essong) was grown on an acid ultisol in southern Cameroon to determine yield response to (1) a hot-water treatment to control nematodes and (2) the application of fertilizer. Observations were made for 42 months. Establishment was unaffected by hot-water treatment or fertilizer. Hot-water treatment reduced nematode infestation to about 30% of that found in untreated plants and increased rhizome survival by 11%. Fertilizer application increased the proportion of bunch-producing plants from 44 to 65% through reduced die-back, toppling and pseudostem breakage during the dry season but had no effect on bunch weight per plant. Fresh bunch yield of the plant-crop was 10.2 Mg ha-1 in unfertilized, untreated, plots; fertilized plots produced 15.3 Mg ha-1 and hot-water treated plots 13 Mg ha-1. Fertilized and hot-water treated plots produced 20.8 Mg ha-1. First ratoon yields were unaffected by fertilizer, but increased due to hot-water treatment from 0.81 to 5.0 Mg ha-1. Plant-crop bunch weight decreased with increasing time between planting and harvest. Mean bunch fresh weight was negatively correlated with an index of root nematode infestation and positively correlated with the number of living roots. For the plant-crop and plant-crop plus ratoon yields, the yield increase due to combined use of fertilizer and hot-water treatment was larger than increases attained by individual measures. Thus combination of hot-water treatment and fertilizer had a synergistic effect on plantain fresh bunch yield, justifying introduction of both measures simultaneously.

The decline in yield of plantain has partly been attributed to inadequate soil moisture and pests, particularly nematodes. The objectives of the study therefore were to determine the effect of mulch from Leucaena leucocephala and Flemingia macrophylla (Willd.) Merr. grown as hedgerows on (i) soil moisture and temperature (ii) growth and yield of plantain and (iii) pathogenic nematode populations. The study was conducted from 1991 to 1994 in Kumasi, Ghana. Treatments comprised of leguminous plants, L. leucocephala and F. macrophylla, and a control (no leguminous plants), arranged in a randomised complete block design with four replications. The leguminous plants were planted in 1991 while the plantain was planted in 1992. Results indicated that the highest biomass yield was produced by F. macrophylla. Mulching with prunings of F. macrophylla resulted in significantly (P < 0.05) higher retention of soil moisture and lower soil temperatures than mulching with prunings of L. leucocephala. Growth of plantain determined by plant height, leaf production, pseudostem girth and yield were significantly greater in F. macrophylla mulched plots than L. leucocephala treatment and control plots where no mulch was applied. Plant parasitic nematodes isolated were Meloidogyne spp., Pratylenchus spp., Paratylenchus spp., Helicotylenchus spp., and Rotylenchus spp. Three years after planting of hedgerows, significantly (P < 0.05) higher populations of Meloidogyne spp. (367 per 100 g soil), Paratylenchus spp. (92 per 100 g soil), Helicotylenchus spp. (8 per 100 g soil), and Rotylenchus spp. (308 per 100 g soil) were associated with L. leucocephala hedgerow than with Flemingia macrophylla hedgerow (42.0, 83.0 per 100 g soil) and the control (74.50, 41.0 per 100 g soil). F. macrophylla has qualities that suppress nematode populations. The results clearly indicated the superiority of Flemingia macrophylla over Leucaena leucocephala as much for plantain production.

Scientific strategies for crop improvement ensue from genetic knowledge gain from the relevant breeding populations. Few genetic studies were undertaken in Musa before the 1990s, despite the importance of the crop in human diet in the tropics. It was believed that genetic studies of most cultivated Musa, a virtually sterile triploid crop, were impossible. This explains the absence, until recently, of inheritance studies in triploid plantain and banana and the lack of genetic markers. Although several characteristics of the Musa crop make genetic analysis difficult, the production of euploid test-cross segregating populations obtained from triploid-diploid crosses has made inheritance studies possible. Thus, plantain and banana genomes have been investigated at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) since 1992. This paper provides insight into the genetics of black sigatoka and banana weevil resistance, pseudostem waxiness, virus susceptibility, apical dominance and suckering behavior, dwarfism, bunch orientation, fruit parthenocarpy, and male fertility. It also discusses the effects of genetic markers, ploidy and the environment on quantitative variation of disease and pest resistance as well as growth parameters of yield. This new knowledge has provided important information to develop IITA's scientific breeding strategy for the genetic improvement of plantain and banana.

The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development. Host plant resistance offers another promising avenue of control. Numerous resistant clones are known, including Yangambi-km 5, Calcutta 4, and Pisang awak. Resistance is most often through antibiosis resulting in egg or larval failure. Banana breeding is a slow and difficult process. Current research is exploring genetic improvement through biotechnology techniques including the introduction of foreign genes. Neem has also shown potential for control of banana weevil. Studies on the use of other botanicals against banana weevil have failed to produce positive results. Chemical control of banana weevil remains a common and effective method for larger scale producers but is beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers. However, the weevil has displayed the ability to develop resistance against a broad range of chemicals. In summary, cultural control remains the most available approach for resource-poor farmers. A combination of several cultural methods is likely to reduce weevil pressure. Among the methods currently under study, microbial control, host plant resistance and neem appear to offer the most promise.

Two cDNAs, designated MWPL1 and MWPL2, encoding putative pectate lyases (Pel; EC 4.2.2.2), which catalyze the cleavage by β-elimination of α-1 → 4-linked galacturonosyl residues of pectins found mostly in middle lamella and primary cell wall in plants, were isolated from ripening fruit of banana (Musa acuminata) and their expressions in fruit during ripening and in response to ethylene were investigated. MWPL1 and MWPL2 encode a single polypeptide of 407 and 454 amino acid residues, respectively. The two cDNAs shared an overall identity of 75% in both nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences. Sequence comparison of MWPL1 and other plant Pels revealed the homology ranging from 76% with zinnia to 48% with ragweed. Southern analysis indicated that MWPL1 might be present as a single copy gene, and there might be up to two copies of MWPL2 in the banana genome. The two cDNAs were expressed differentially and/or spatially in various banana organs, with female flower and fruit tissues showing accumulation of the MWPL2 transcript, which was not detected in root, pseudostem, leaf, male flower and ovary, whereas the MWPL1 transcript was not detectable in all organs tested. In fruit tissue during ripening, although transcripts of both members were not detectable in unripe preclimacteric fruits, they began to accumulate as ripening progressed and the level remained high thereafter in overripe fruits. However, the magnitude of transcript accumulation differed between the two Pel members, with substantially more abundant MWPL2 than MWPL1 in ripening fruit. Similar differential transcript accumulation was also observed between peel and pulp, where the former was markedly higher than the latter. Expression of both Pel members was also affected by exogenous ethylene, whose presence at 5-100 ppm stimulated accumulation of MWPL1 and MWPL2 transcripts in preclimacteric fruit, suggesting that ethylene may play an important regulatory role in regulating Pel expression during fruit ripening of the banana.

In an attempt to explain the difference in banana (Musa AAA cv. Grand Naine) plants with poor, regular, and good development, their root stratification and spatial distribution was determined in Costa Rican field conditions. Samples were taken from soil blocks at 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm distances from the pseudostem, and at every 15cm depth, from 0 to 120cm in non-flowering plants that were 180-190cm high. The plant development sites did affect the proportion of fresh thick roots (> 5 mm-d) as follows: 49, 63, and 56% in plants with poor, regular, and good development, respectively. The lateral distribution of thick and fine (1 to 5mm-d) roots and root hairs was affected by the horizontal distance from the pseudostem. The total percentage of roots decreased as horizontal distance increased in any plant development. Soil depth affected the distribution of every flesh root type throughout the soil profile. The total fresh root weight in the excavated area (0-90 cm from the pseudostem and 0-120cm depth) was 0.95, 0.9, and 0.76kg, for poor, regular, and good developed plants, respectively. Therefore, the explanation for regular and good plants more likely was the depth of the root system, which reached up to 120cm deep, while in the poor plants the roots reached only 75 cm deep. Additional studies that relate the root stratification with crop yield are encouraged.

An experiment was established to characterize twenty-seven locally selected and introduced plantain clones. The clones were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Twenty morphological descriptors were used to obtain information of the plant, bunch and individual fruits at bunch-emergence and at harvest. The clones were first organized into two main groups on the basis of their genomic constitution: true plantain (Musa AAB) and cooking banana (Musa ABB, AAAB). Within the second group, we included three Musa AAB clones that are considered distinctive cooking bananas because the M. acuminata species responsible for the donation of the A genome had its origin in the Pacific and not in Asia. In each main group the clones were subdivided into true-horn, false-horn and French on the basis of bunch phenotype. Clones in these three subgroups were further subdivided into tall and dwarf, depending on the height of the pseudostem. After the clones were organized into this classification, statistical comparisons were made between or among those corresponding to the same subdivision, utilizing the data obtained from the plant, bunch and individual fruit traits. This scheme is easy to implement in the field, provides for the clustering and separation of clones regardless of their geographical origin and common names, and offers the opportunity for agronomists and horticulturists to learn about the economic potential of the clones from the outset. The application of this scheme will allow the number of plantain accessions in the TARS collection to be reduced from 27 to 20 clones.

The spatial location of the banana (Musa AAA) root parasitic nematodes within three root parts considering two root thickness was determined in three commercial farm management systems, which differ in weed and nematode management. Roots in each farm management system were classified in thick (>5 mm-d) and thin (1 ≤ 5 mm-d) roots. From each root type, the epidermis, the cortical parenchyma (CP) and the vascular cylinder (VC) were separated by fingernail, and nematodes were extracted by maceration of each root part. Independent of the farm management system, and for either root thickness, highest numbers of Radopholus similis per gram of root was found in the CP, followed by the epidermis and VC. The highest number of Helicotylencus spp., Pratylenchus spp. and the total nematode population per gram of root was found in the epidermis. Considering the number of nematodes per root part, the highest number of R. similis and total nematodes was located in the CP, while Helicotylenchus spp. and Pratylenchus spp. were concentrated in the epidermis. These patterns were approximately reproduced in the two root thickness and in the three farm management systems. This behavior suggests that injection of systemic nematicides into the plant pseudostem to replace the granular applications on surface soil might be promissory. © 2004 Elsevier SAS.

Banana and plantains rank fourth among the most important food crops of the world, and India holds the position of the largest producer. A study was undertaken to evaluate the potential yield of new synthetic banana hybrids based on bunch weight and fruit quality. It also assessed the nematode damage, Sigatoka leaf spot disease and parthenocarpy stability. Materials and methods. Thirteen new hybrids and eleven parental bananas of dessert type were used and evaluated in the first vegetative generation. Plant growth parameters, viz., pseudostem height and girth, number of leaves, and suckers per plant were measured at the flowering stage and the damage of roots by nematode and intensity of the Sigatoka leaf spot disease were assessed at the harvest stage. The content of total soluble solids, and reducing, non-reducing and total sugars in the fruit was estimated. Results. All the hybrids exhibited parthenocarpy and there was no reversion from parthenocarpy to non-parthenocarpy. The plant height and girth and the leaf number varied among the hybrids significantly. The maximum bunch weight was recorded for H-212 (ABB) which showed a regular suckering habit, very high content of total soluble solids and reducing sugars, and more leaves without leaf spot infection than the other hybrids; moreover, H-212 is a female sterile dessert-type banana and it is tolerant to nematode and resistant to Sigatoka. The reproduction factor of Radopholus similis on H-211 (AA), H-213 (ABB) and H-02-01 (AA) was significantly lower than on H-203 (AA), H-209 (ABB) and H-205 (AA). Conclusions. Our studies distinguished one triploid ABB hybrid H-212 with high yield and fruit quality, and no sanitary problems; it can be released for commercial cultivation to banana growers. © 2004 Cirad/EDP Sciences.

The effect of weed management on banana (Musa AAA cv. Grande Naine) parasitic nematodes was evaluated under Costa Rican field conditions with special reference to their spatial distribution and the damage caused to roots of different thickness classes and their relation to yield losses. Root samples were taken at plant harvest, from soil blocks at 0-30,30-60 and 60-90 cm from the pseudostem, and at every 15 cm depth, from 0 to 120 cm. Weed management neither affected the nematode numbers nor their horizontal and vertical distribution and associated root damage. Differences in Radopholus similis (P<0.0001), Helicotylenchus spp. (P=0.0115) and total nematode populations (P<0.0001) were found in roots of different thickness. The average populations in thick, thin and fine roots were for R. similis 270,666 (57%), 120,401 (25%) and 11,313 (2%); for Helicotylenchus spp. 36,094 (7%), 22,508 (5%) and 8,824 (2%); and total nematodes 390,425 (65%), 145,534 (31%) and 21,177 (4%), respectively. No linear correlations were found between bunch weight and the number and density of nematodes or with their damage. Even though, no statistical difference was found in bunch weight, the manual weed control plot yielded 1.4 kg heavier bunches, which might have important implications for sustainable agriculture. The implementation of weed control by hand chopping may improve the physical, chemical and biological soil properties and reduce soil erosion, temperature fluctuations, evaporation rate, and nutrient leaching, and increase water infiltration. As a consequence of the decrease in herbicide applications, soil and air pollution might be reduced. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study was conducted to evaluate yield performance of micro-propagated (MPd) East African cooking banana (Musa AAA East Africa) cv. Uganda and cv. Bukoba in the Eastern zone of Tanzania. Plant size of MPd cv. Bukoba was significantly bigger (p<0.05) with pseudostem height, girth and height to girth ratio of 425.4, 67.0 cm and 6.4 compared to 370.6, 59.5 cm and 6.1 of the conventionally propagated (CPd) banana, respectively. Moreover, plant crops of MPd cv. Uganda and Bukoba were harvested 29 and 27 days earlier compared to the plant crops of CPd banana, respectively. On the other hand, plant crop of MPd cv. Bukoba produced smaller (p<0.05) bunches and fruits weighing 14.4 kg and 138.5 g compared to 23.9 kg and 146.2 g of the plant crop of CPd banana, respectively. Similarly, ratoon crops of MPd cv. Bukoba produced lower bunch and fruit weight than those of CPd banana. The low bunch yield of the MPd cv. Bukoba could be due to reduction in fruit weight. Plant crop of MPd cv. Uganda produced more uniform fruits in terms of weight, length and girth whereas that of MPd cv. Bukoba produced more uniform fruits in terms of weight and girth. Fruit size uniformity was insignificantly different in subsequent ratoon crops of both cultivars. Further studies are required to determine causes and bases of lower yield in MPd cv.

In order to identify the effect of burrowing nematodes on the shoots (pseudostem and leaves) of banana plants and to determine whether or not shoot characteristics are associated with plant resistance to nematodes two experiments were conducted in controlled conditions within polytunnels. The banana plants were harvested on three occasions for the measurement of root morphology and biomass. Varieties differed in their resistance to nematodes from resistant (Yg Km5, FHIA 17, FHIA 03) and partly resistant (FHIA 01, FHIA 25) to not resistant (FHIA 23, Williams). Nematodes reduced total plant dry weight at the first harvest in Experiment 1 and by an average of 8.8% in Experiment 2, but did not affect leaf area in either experiment. The ratio of above-ground weight to total plant weight was reduced from 75% to 72% in nematode-infected plants compared with the control plants for all varieties tested in Experiment 1, but was only reduced in FHIA 25 and FHIA 23 in Experiment 2. Varieties differed in above-ground growth. The FHIA varieties had greater shoot weights and leaf area than YgKm5 and Williams. Overall, resistance to nematodes was associated with the partitioning of a greater proportion of biomass to the roots than to above-ground parts. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

A genome-wide tagging strategy was followed for the isolation and characterization of novel banana promoters. Embryogenic cell suspensions were transformed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing a promoterless, codonoptimized luciferase (Iuc+) gene next to the right T-DNA border. Around 16,000 transgenic cell colonies were screened two months after transformation at room temperature for baseline luciferase activity and positive colonies were removed. The remaining cell cultures were re-screened in real-time at 26°C followed by a gradual decrease to 8°C. The baseline activation frequency was 0.98%, while the frequency of lowtemperature luciferase activity was 0.61% in the same population of cell cultures. Transgenic colonies responsive to low temperature were regenerated to plantlets with the expression pattern monitored during different regeneration stages. Enhanced, repressed or stable expression patterns were observed and high luciferase activity was restricted to specific organs including the root, meristematic region and pseudostem. DNA gel blot analyses revealed the presence of multiple T-DNA inserts averaging 3.2 (range 1 to 5) in five independent lines tested. Banana DNA sequences flanking the right and left T-DNA border were cloned via TAIL-PCR and inverse PCR. However, some lines contained in the T-DNA flanks vector backbone parts, tandem repeats and sequences derived from the enhanced CaMV 35S promoter with part of the selectable marker gene neo from the tagging construct. RT-PCR analysis was performed to identify and confirm in lines with multiple inserts the sequence that activated luciferase expression. Confirmed sequences are currently fused to the uidA reporter gene and back-transformed to cell suspensions in order to confirm their promoter activity.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlations between vegetative and productive characteristics of banana tree (Musa spp) cv Prata-Anã (genomic group AAB) differently managed from the conventional system. The experiment was carried out in an orchard with five years old banana plants spaced by 3,5 x 2,0 m, in the Fazendas Reunidas FFL Ltda., at Cristais Paulista, São Paulo, Brazil. The experiment was a split plot under a completely randomized design with three replicates, being the main treatments constituted by: M1 - daughter-plant without the mother-plant whose stem was cut after flowering; M2 - daughter-plant and mother- plant conventionally managed until harvest. The sub plots were constituted by twelve periods of selection of the daughter-plants (February 2002 to January 2003). The pseudostem diameter and the bunch weight of all plants and the vegetative period of the daughter-plants were evaluated. The statistical analysis showed a positive correlation between the stem diameter of the daughter-plants and mother-plants. The stem diameter of the mother-plant was positive correlated with its bunch weight. However the stem diameter of the daughter-plant not was correlated with its bunch weight. The vegetative cycle and the pseudostem diameter of the daughter-plants were negatively correlated. The Plant management (M1 and M2) and the selection of periods daughter-plant did not affected the correlations evaluated in this study.

An agronomic study was conducted to evaluate three Musa hybrids (BITA-3 - cooking banana, FHIA-21 and CRBP-39- both hybrid plantains) with five hundred farmers in the two Assin districts in the Central region of Ghana. At harvest sensory evaluation was carried out on the three hybrids for use as fufu, ampesi and ripe fried plantain to access their acceptability at four locations in the two districts. The results showed that there was no significant difference (p<0.05) between the numbers of leaves at flowering among the hybrids across the locations. The hybrids showed superiority over the local check in terms of number of functional leaves from flowering to harvest. All the hybrids (FHIA-21, CRBP 39, BITA-3 and FHIA-25) exhibited stable performance in yield and growth characteristics across the locations. FHIA-25 was however late maturing (18-20 months) whereas BITA-3 was early maturing (10-12 months). Nevertheless, the bunch weight (40-50 kg) of FHIA-25 could be said to have compensated for the long crop cycle. Daughter sucker production by FHIA-25 was also low (two daughter suckers at flowering). BITA-3 was roboust and sturdy with pseudostem girth of 60 cm carrying an average bunch weight of 25 kg. All the hybrids were resistant to the black Sigatoka disease. These results suggested that the performance of the hybrids was not influenced by the seasons or locations. It implies that under good management practices, farmers would be assured of good yields irrespective of time or season of planting so long as there is adequate supply of moisture. The results of the sensory evaluation indicated that there were no significant differences (p<0.01) between FHIA-21 and CRBP-39 and the local Apantu across the location, across the parameters and the recipes assessed. FHIA-21 and CRBP-39 were the most prefened and compared favourably with the local triploids (Apantu and Apem) with BITA-3 the least preferred. The hybrids were accepted for ripe fried plantain at stages 3 and 4 of ripening. Beyond these stages of ripening, the hybrids could only be used for other processed food recipes. © 2008 Academic Journals Inc.

World production of bananas, estimated at 106 million tons (Lescot 2006), ranks fourth in agricultural production. Bananas make up the largest production of fruits and the largest international trade, more than apple, orange, grape and melon. Bananas are cultivated in more than 120 countries in tropical and subtropical zones on 5 continents. Banana products represent an essential food resource and have an important socioeconomic and ecological role. Current varieties are generally seedless triploid clones either of the single genome A from the species Musa acuminata (group AAA) or of both genomes A and B from species M. acuminata and Musa balbisiana (groups AAB and ABB). More rarely, diploid varieties (AA and AB) and tetraploid clones are encountered. There are two major channels of banana production: those cultivated for export and those reserved for local markets. The main banana varieties cultivated for export, known as Grande Naine, Poyo and Williams, belong to the monospecific triploid bananas (AAA) of the Cavendish sub-group. They differ from each other only in somatic mutations such as plant height or bunch and fruit shape. Their production relies on an intensive monoculture of the agro-industrial type, without rotation, and a high quantity of inputs. Banana cultivation for local consumption is based on a large number of varieties adapted to different conditions of production as well as the varied uses and tastes of consumers. Diploid bananas, close to the ancestral wild forms, are still cultivated in Southeast Asia. In other regions, triploid clones belonging to different sub-groups Plantain, Silk, Lujugira, Gros Michel, Pisang Awak are the most widely distributed. Bananas have many uses. They are not only consumed as fresh fruits but also cooked, like plantains. They are processed in various ways, into chips, fries, fritters, purees, jams, ketchup and alcohol (banana wine and beer have a very significant production in East Africa). The daily per capita consumption of bananas from 30 g to over 500 g in some East African countries. Apart from the fruit, other parts of the plant are also used: the pseudostem is used for its fibres and as floaters (Musa textilis or abacá) in the Philippines, and the leaves are used to make shelters or roofs or as wraps for cooking. In Thailand, the floral buds of particular varieties (Pisang Awak) are used in various culinary preparations. Some varieties are also considered to have medicinal properties. Cultivated throughout the world, bananas are threatened by several diseases and pests (Stover and Simmonds 1987; Jones 1999) that need to be taken into account for banana improvement. Various major fungal diseases are constraints in industrial production and, to a lesser degree, in local production. For example, Sigatoka disease (SD) due to Mycosphaerella musicola and black leaf streak disease (BLSD) caused by M. fijiensis result in production losses in large industrial plantations and necessitate costly pest control measures to be adopted. In certain production zones, Fusarium wilt due to the soil fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense prevents the cultivation of susceptible varieties like the Gros Michel types. Great constraints are also exerted by the nematodes Radopholus similis and several representatives of the genus pratylenchus and by the black weevil of banana, Cosmopolites sordidus. Also, viral diseases are spreading. Those of greatest concern are due to BBTV (banana bunchy top virus), CMV (cucumber mosaic virus), BSV (banana streak virus) and BBMV (banana bract mosaic virus). Chemical control measures used in intensive cultivation are not available to small banana farmers in developing countries. Furthermore, for some diseases, there is no effective chemical control. Genetic improvement has thus been focused mainly on obtaining varieties resistant to principal pests and diseases. Breeding bananas through hybridisation, which began in the 1920s, is currently being pursued at seven research centres. FHIA in Honduras is breeding banana for export as well as the cooking types (Rowe 1984). EMBRAPA-CNPMF in Brazil (Dantas et al. 1993), NRCB and TNAU in India (Sathiamoorthy et al. 2000; Krishnamoorthy and Kumar 2004) aim at breeding local types of dessert and cooking bananas. CARBAP (Jenny et al. 2003) in Cameroon and IITA (Tenkouano and Swennen 2004) in Nigeria are conducting research on plantain and banana breeding in Africa. These six research centres are mainly interested in developing new tetraploid varieties by crossing triploid varieties and wild or improved diploid clones with resistance to diseases. Some secondary triploids derived from crosses between these new tetraploid varieties and other diploid clones were also obtained. In the French West Indies, CIRAD has conceived another crossing strategy aimed at the development of triploid varieties directly from diploid plant material (Bakry et al. 2001). Since the 1980s, apart from these conventional breeding approaches, other groups have focused on mutagenesis as at IAEA (Roux 2004) in Austria or on the selection of somaclonal variants as at TBRI (Hwang and Ko 1990) in Taiwan. These technologies appeared as a result of the development of in vitro culture techniques designed for rapid industrial multiplication of micro-propagated banana plants. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

The results of research on the water relations and irrigation need of banana are collated and summarised in an attempt to link fundamental studies on crop physiology to irrigation practices. Background information on the ecology of the banana and crop development processes, with emphasis on root growth and water uptake, is presented, followed by reviews of the influence of water stress on gas exchange (stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration), crop water use, and yield. Emphasis is placed on research that has international relevance and, where appropriate, three geographical areas (the tropics, subtropics and Mediterranean climates) are considered. Although roots can extend to depths of 1.0-1.5 m, the effective depth of rooting is usually taken to be 0-0.40 m, sometimes extending to 0.60 m. Stomatal conductance is a sensitive measure of soil water availability and plant water status, whilst transpiration rates can be limited by dry air (saturation deficits &gt;2.0 kPa). In the subtropics, there are seasonal differences in the crop coefficient (Kc) with values ranging from 0.6 in the winter months to about 1.0 Epan in the summer. It is difficult to draw generic conclusions with wide applicability from the irrigation experiments as they were reported. All the components of marketable yield can be enhanced by irrigation whilst applying insufficient water delays crop development. Annual yield responses to irrigation are variable, but water use efficiencies of 40 kg ha-1 mm-1 (fresh fruit/water applied) have been achieved in the tropics and subtropics (and elsewhere up to 80 kg ha-1 mm-1 with partial replacement of the soil water deficit). To ensure large yields of (marketable) fruit, soil water deficits must be kept low (Ψm &gt;-20 kPa at 0.2 m depth). In the subtropics, this means irrigation intervals should not exceed 2-3 d during the summer. The cooling effect of irrigation with micro-sprinklers on the soil and pseudostem temperatures, compared with drippers, can delay crop development and reduce annual yields by 30%. There is some (limited) evidence that the presence of the B genome contributes to drought tolerance. Yield response factors to irrigation for different growth stages have yet to be confirmed. Opportunities to improve the water productivity of the many, diverse banana cultivars need to be explored further. © Cambridge University Press 2009.

Purpose of review: This article reviews some of the versatile postharvest uses of plantains and other components of plantain plants. Findings: Plantain belongs to the Musacace family and is cultivated in over 120 countries. Many African, Asian and Latin American countries depend primarily on the plantain plant for sustainability. Mature plantains are consumed as a staple on cooking, while overripe fruit is consumed in raw form. Plantains are rich in iron, potassium, ascorbic acid and vitamin A, and are a very good source of starch, which has various uses, such as in functional foods and edible films. In addition to plantains being used for food, the waste material such as the peel, pseudo-stem, pith, male bud and leaves, have also been used as food and feed, as well as for other special purposes in most of the plantain-growing parts of the world. Directions for future research: A plantain-based diet can be designed for diabetic people based on its low glycaemic index. Moreover, due to its high starch content and cheaper cost, it has the potential to be added to other fruit-based juices and beverages as starch filler. Further research can be done on deflavouring of plantain, which might overwhelm other fruit based beverages when added as a filler. Since most of the parts of the plantain plant have some or other therapeutic value, further research can be done to extract the phytochemicals for potential drug development.

The use of banana plants in the historical iron production industries of several pre-colonial kingdoms of southern and western Uganda has been documented by the presence of banana pseudostem impressions preserved in slag, a waste product of smelting. An investigation into the selection and use of plants within these technologies was undertaken in 2003 in southern Uganda, implementing a new methodology to record the archaeobotanical in formation contained within the slag. Non-destructive casts of plant impressions were made on-site using a polyvinyl-siloxane dental gel. These were then taken to London for further examination, and the casts were identifed to the level of plant family, enabling quantitative and qualitative analysis. More recently, archaeometallurgical research in western Uganda in 2007 also revealed the repeated presence of these banana pseudostem impressions in iron smelting slag, confrming that this was an unusual, yet international aspect of these localized iron production techologies.

Field performance of two IITA plantain hybrids ('PITA-1', 'PITA-4') were assessed at two locations in Ghana alongside two local landraces (False Horn 'Brodeyuo', Intermediate French 'Oniaba') and a hybrid cultivar 'Apem Hemaa' ('FHIA-21'). The objective of the study was to identify high yielding and disease resistant hybrids for growers in Ghana. The hybrids were evaluated for their agronomic performance and yield, tolerance to Black Sigatoka disease, number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest, crop cycle, plant height and pseudostem girth. The results showed that the hybrids were tolerant/resistant to the Black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) disease with high number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest. This characteristic of the hybrids was an important feature that could fit well into the smallholder cropping system. The crop cycles were comparable to that of 'False Horn' plantains. The yield performance of the hybrids was better compared to the landraces. The number of hands per bunch produced by the hybrids was also higher than those of the landraces except the intermediate French plantain ('Oniaba'). The finger lengths of the IITA hybrids were however shorter compared to the landraces and this could hinder their acceptance by consumers.

Nutrient potassium is critical in plantain (Musa species cv. AAB) nutrition. It plays a key role in the vegetative growth and bunch development. Application of 300 kg muriate of potash (K20) per hectare was beneficial in the plant crop, while a higher rate (400 kg K20/ha) enhanced growth and favorable yield components (number of hands and fingers/bunch, finger mass, girth and length). Plants fertilized with 400 kg K20/ha were tallest (3.5m), had largest pseudostem girth (56-58cm) with highest (11-12) number of functional leaves at flowering and attained flowering stage after 9 mouths of vegetative growth. Bunch mass, bunch yield/ha and yield components were significantly (P = 0.05) highest at 300 kg k 20/ha in plant crop and at 400 kg K20/ha in ratoon crop. Heaviest bunches were 8.8 and 9.8 kg/plant in plant and ratoon crops, respectively, giving the respective corresponding bunch yields of 14.66 and 16.33 tonnes/ha. Application of 400 kg K20/ha appeared adequate for sustainable production of false horn plantain in the high rainforest zone of Cross River State. © 2009 Trop. Agric. (Trinidad).

Use of biotechnology techniques combined with mutagenesis in Musa spp. allows genetic variability to be increased to improve important agronomic characters. Damage caused to Musa plantations by strong winds and tropical hurricanes makes it necessary to select clones with reduced height and better resistance to wind. The objective of this study is to develop mutant clones of FHIA-21 (Musa AAAB) with reduced height, a good agronomical trait. Multiple buds obtained by in vitro culture were subjected to gamma radiation from 60Co sources at dose of 25 Gy. Irradiated buds were multiplied, elongated, rooted, and then planted (10,000 plants) in the field. In the clonal study, 98 mutant clones with lower pseudostem height compared with the original cultivar were selected. Four mutants with reduced height at bunch emergency were selected (IBP 14-23, IBP 17-13, IBP 24-14, and IBP 47-4). Mutants IBP 24-14 and IBP 47-4 showed poor agronomical features, reduced foliar area, and resulted of no commercial value. The results indicated that mutant IBP 14-23 retains the character of resistance to black sigatoka from its parent FHIA-21, combined with important agronomical traits during the third culture cycle, making it a promising cultivar material, representing 0. 01% selection efficiency. This is the first report of improvement for height reduction of the tetraploid hybrid FHIA-21 through physical mutagenesis. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

This chapter describes the morphology of the musa plant and discusses the potential benefits of morphological diversity. The East African Highland bananas, also considered as the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, display a very variable pseudostem color, the intensity of which varies with environmental conditions. Thus, in the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, the pseudostem and leaf petioles tend to get darker as altitude increases. Leaf pigmentation and posture may affect photosynthetic efficiency and transpiration rates as described by Brun and Turner, but there are surprisingly not many recent studies relating leaf morphology to photosynthetic efficiency or transpiration of the existing cultivars. Continued elongation of the main stalk of the inflorescence causes the bunch to hang over, the bracts open and fall, disclosing the female flower clusters or hands. The female flowers undergo further development without being pollinated or fertilized. A comprehensive study of the root system of a wider gene pool is required to construct an ideotype target for genetic improvement of plantains and bananas. © 2011 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

The conventional breeding programme at the Banana Research Station, Kannara, India has produced two dessert banana hybrids, 'BRS-1', ['Agniswar' (AAB) × 'Pisang Lilin' (AA)] and 'BRS-2', ['Vannan' (AAB) × 'Pisang Lilin'], which have been developed and released for cultivation in Kerala. These hybrids are very resistant to Sigatoka leaf spot, a trait inherited from the male parent. Current breeding strategies are focused on the improvement of 'Nendran' (AAB), the commercial French plantain cultivar of the state, for higher productivity, dwarf stature and resistance to Sigatoka leaf spot, weevil borers and nematodes utilizing wild/natural/bred diploids. Though limited by low levels of female fertility, development of plantain hybrids resistant to black leaf streak based on triploid/diploid crosses has been reported. Female-fertile clones of 'Nendran' identified in the genebank were pollinated with the wild Musa acuminata ssp. burmannicoides 'Calcutta-4', highly resistant to Sigatoka leaf spot. Low seed set and germination reduced the recovery of hybrids for evaluation. One hybrid progeny resulting from the cross ['Nendran' clone 'Chengalikodan' × 'Calcutta 4'] with close resemblance to the female parent recorded a plant height of 360 cm, pseudostem girth of 62 cm and 12 leaves at shooting. It registered a bunch weight of 13 kg with 8 hands and 90 fruits. Unlike its susceptible female parent, the hybrid displayed very high resistance to Sigatoka leaf spot, imparted by the male parent. Being male- and female-fertile, the hybrid is being back-crossed with 'Nendran' and crossed with selected diploids. Embryo culture is being standardised to improve the recovery of hybrid progeny.

This study aimed to determine the effect of silicon (Si) in reducing the symptoms of Fusarium wilt, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), on banana plants. Banana seedlings of Grand Nain (resistant) and Maçã (susceptible) were grown in plastic trays amended with 0 (-Si) or 0.39 g Si (+Si) per kg of soil and inoculated with Foc at 60 days after transplanting. The Si concentration in the roots and rhizome-pseudostem significantly increased by 30.26 and 58.82%, respectively, for the +Si treatment compared with -Si treatment. The Si concentration in the roots and rhizome-pseudostem of Grand Nain plants was, respectively, 11.57 and 37.04% greater than that found in Maçã. The +Si plants showed a reduction of 12.37, 49.81, 51.87 and 20.39%, respectively, for the area under reflex leaf symptoms progress curve, the area under root symptoms progress curve, the area under disease progress curve and the area under asymptomatic fungal colonization of tissue progress curve compared with -Si plants. The area under darkening of rhizome-pseudostem progress curve (AUDRPPC) of Maçã significantly increased by 15.98% for the -Si treatment in comparison with the +Si treatment. For the +Si treatment, the AUDRPPC of the plants from the Maçã cultivar significantly decreased by 20.59% in comparison with the plants from the Grand Nain cultivar. The area under relative lesion length progress curve (AURLLPC) of the plants from the Maçã cultivar significantly decreased by 41.54% for the +Si treatment in comparison with the -Si treatment. There was no significant difference between the -Si and +Si treatments in the AUDRPPC and AURLLPC of Grand Nain. For the +Si treatment, the AURLLPC of Grand Nain significantly decreased by 9.23% in comparison with Maçã. There was no significant difference between the Grand Nain and Maçã for the AUDRPPC and AURLLPC in the -Si treatment. The findings of this study show that supplying Si to banana plants, especially to a susceptible cultivar to Foc, had a great potential in reducing the intensity of Fusarium wilt and may play a key role in disease management when banana plants are cultivated in Si-deficient soils infested by this pathogen. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

The physicochemical properties of plantain (Musa paradisiaca) and banana (Musa sapientum) pseudostem wastes have been determined. It was found that the average moisture content for both samples were very high while the concentrations of solubles in both cold and hot water were moderate, the concentrations of the solubles of the pulverized pseudostems in 1:2v/v ethanol-benzene solution mixture were higher than those of 18% NaOH. The mineral elements detected in the leaf-fold and the core of both Musa paradisiaca and Musa sapientum pseudostem wastes were Na, K, Cr, Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu, and P. Pb was present in trace concentrations in only the banana leaf-folds. The phytochemical composition in mg/100g for the plantain and banana pseudostem wastes were: oxalates (66.28±2.01, 41.56±2.55); phytates (3.78±0.05, 3.23±0.33); tannins (7.99±0.26, 6.55±0.33); and cyanogenic glycosides (1.47±0.14, 1.44±0.33) respectively. Flavonoids, saponins and alkaloids were present in both varieties, but steroids were absent. The values of lignin ranged between 2.28 and 7.30% pseudostems, the carbohydrate between 39.71 and 62.21 mg/100g for plantain and 42.13 and 93.82 mg/100g for banana pseudostems while the pentosan content for both ranged between 6.67 and 11.73 mg/100g. Generally, plantain, pseudostems waste contains higher values of the phytochemicals than the banana pseudostems except the pentosen content; both contain high amount of carbohydrate which can be exploited for the preparation of pulp for paper making and for production of cellulose derivatives and sugar.

The objective of this study was to examine the molecular and phenotypic variability of 'Prata Anã' banana clones cultivated in northern Minas Gerais State. For the phenotypic and molecular characterization, the clones were collected from five properties. The morphological characterization of 20 clones was accomplished through a qualitative evaluation of 74 descriptors. For the molecular evaluations, 45 clones were collected, and 14 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA primers were used. Among the 74 morphological descriptors evaluated in the 20 'Prata Anã' banana tree clones, 53 descriptors presented in the same homogeneous class for all clones. The presence of anthocyanin in the pseudostem (ANT) and the shape (BUS) and flexion (FLX) of the bunch clearly differentiated the 'Prata Anã' banana clones from the commercial cultivar. A total of 176 bands were produced from the molecular analysis using the 14 RAPD primers; there were 116 monomorphic and 60 polymorphic bands, with an average polymorphism percentage of 52.2%. The amplification using the OPP 14 primer resulted in the greatest percentage of polymorphic bands at 88%. The dendrogram indicated that each of the 45 'Prata Anã' clones that were evaluated using RAPD markers clustered with the commercial 'Prata Anã' cultivar.

Banana is one of the most important food items in the Philippines, ranked fourth among food crops after rice, wheat and maize and being first among fruits. High yield of banana plantations requires enormous amount of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.This study was conducted to determine the potential of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and nitrogen fixing bacteria (NFB) biofertilizers as growth promoters and biological control agents against nematodes in tissue-cultured banana var. Lakatan under screen house conditions. Meriplants were inoculated with AMF (Mykovam™) and NFB (Bio-N™) during planting in individual plastic bags filled with sterile soil sand mixture. Plant parasitic nematodes, Radopholus similis and Meloidogyne incognita suspension were poured into the soil, two months after inoculation with biofertilizers at concentrations of 1,000 and 5,000 larvae or eggs per seedling, respectively. Plant height, pseudostem diameter and leaf area were taken every 2 weeks. At fourth month, the plants were harvested and extent of damage due to nematodes and the number of colony forming units of NFB were determined. Results show that AMF and AMF+NFB inoculated seedlings grew better than the control plants. AMF treated plants were taller, had bigger pseudostem diameter, larger leaf area, highest fine, coarse root and total plant dry weights than the control and the other treatments. Growth of plants infectedwith R. similis alone was comparable with M. incognita and the control. M. incognita-infected plants had numerous root galls. Root necrosis were observed only in R. similis-infected plants. AMF reduced root galls by 33% relative to those inoculated with M. incognita. Percent mycorrhizal colonization was not affected by either NFB or the nematodes. The roots of AMF+NFB gave the highest bacterial colony count (8±1.02 × 10 4 ) which was reduced by AMF+NFB+R. similis (5±0.80 × 10 3 ) and the lowest was with AMF+NFB+ M. incognita (5± 0.50 × 10 3 ). This implies that M. incognita and R. similis reduced the NFB bacterial colonies.

The need for more efficient nutrient use in adverse conditions, such as droughts, facilitated the development of new alternatives for fertilizer application, such as direct insertion into the vascular system of the pseudostem of harvested banana plants (Musa AAA Simmonds), considering the plant interconnection between the mother plant and the sucker in succession. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of fertilizer insertion into the pseudostem of banana plants compared to the conventional soil fertilization system. The study was conducted at two locations (north and center of Urabá region), setting different rates of fertilizer treatments (75, 100 and 125% of the commercial rate) inserted at different heights (0.6 m and 0.9 m) with a soil application of fertilizers as a control treatment. Biometric (height, pseudostem diameter, number of leaves), physiological (specific leaf area and specific leaf weight), and production variables were evaluated in the plants. According to the results, it was evident that the 0.9 m insertion height of the fertilizer was better than 0.6 m and the soil application. Although no significant differences were found between doses of fertilizer, we observed a trend of better performance for plants in treatments of 75% and 100% fertilizer dose inserted at 0.9 m.

Micropropagated banana plantlets represent a good planting material to establish new growing areas or replace old plantations. The plantlets are devoid of pathogens but also of beneficial root inhabitants (e.g., endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [AMF]) that may help plants withstand stresses. Mycorrhization of banana is usually conducted at the hardening/post-hardening phases. Only a few studies have reported their application in vitro, and none have investigated the subsequent impact on ex vitro acclimatization. Here, we report for the first time the effects of in vitro mycorrhization of banana plantlets on growth following transfer to soil. Banana plantlets were pre-mycorrhized under autotrophic conditions. During in vitro culture, heavy root colonization of the banana plantlets was observed. At 5 and 7 wk after transfer to a peat–sand soil substrate, the root system remained highly colonized. The growth (pseudostem height) and biomass were significantly higher than those of control plants grown on media without AMF. The mean shoot dry weight of the pre-mycorrhized plants at 5 wk after transplanting was 66.7 and 34.6% greater than those of non-mycorrhized plantlets grown on modified Strullu-Romand (MSR) and Murashige and Skoog (MS) media, respectively, and was also greater at week 7 (by 64.7 and 40%, respectively). In vitro mycorrhization under autotrophic culture conditions thus represents a promising tool for the pre-adaptation of micropropagated banana plantlets to ex vitro conditions. © 2015, The Society for In Vitro Biology.

Dessert banana production worldwide is based on just a few highly productive, easy to grow and international market compatible cultivars from the Cavendish sub-group (AAA genome). However, these cultivars are hampered by pests and diseases, which has led to extensive pesticide use. New pest and disease resistant varieties that are productive enough to meet international market demand are now needed to reduce pesticide use and thus the detrimental environmental impact. Hybrid bananas bred by the CIRAD banana breeding program are resistant to many diseases, particularly Sigatoka diseases, but exhibit morphological traits and yield components which differ markedly from those of Cavendish bananas. After an analysis of traits related to plant morphology and yield in 530 banana hybrids, the effects of modifying the level of competition between bunches and suckers through sucker pruning management practices were compared on the new hybrid CIRAD 925 and on a reference variety from the Cavendish sub-group ‘Grande Naine’. Hybrids from the CIRAD banana breeding program tend to have thin stems, small bunches and a short crop cycle. Total sucker pruning until mother plant harvest significantly increased the fruit diameter, first cycle bunch weight, second cycle duration and decreased the plant size. However, the effect on bunch weight was greater for Grande Naine, while the effects on second cycle duration and pseudostem girth were greater for CIRAD 925. The level of apical dominance of the central meristem on suckers seemed to explain the varietal differences in the effects of sucker pruning management. Our results showed that traits related to plant morphology and yield components could be modified by sucker pruning management and that a tailored management of mother-plant/sucker competition could be a way to improve the suitability of new hybrids for the banana industry. © 2016

Being one of the important tropical and subtropical fruit trees, banana (Musa.spp.) belongs to the family Musaceae and the order Scitaminae with two genera, Musa and Ensete. In a field survey, research team has discovered a potential banana mutant strain ‘HD-1’ with a sound economic value. The results of the finding are as follows: based on Simmonds’ classification, the pseudostem of banana strain ‘HD-1’ is relatively short and purplish red; its upright outward petiole groove has red edges and wraps its pseudostem loosely. Its ploidy is 3×, AAA type. Karyotype analysis shows that the number of chromosomes is 33, the karyotype formula is 2n=3x=33=2L + 3 M2 + 4 M1 + 2 S, ‘HD-1’ is classified as ‘1B’ type. With the help of ISSR molecular markers, we find thatbanana 'HD-1' has the closest relationship with Pubei and Tianbao dwarf banana; the similarity coefficient is 0.81. In an artificial simulation tests of cold, drought and salt resistance environment changes of physiological and biochemical indexes indicate that ‘HD-1’ exhibits stronger defense capability than Brazil banana. By way of inoculation with injury of root dipping method, we respectively treat two kinds of banana seedlings inoculated Banana Fusarium wilt race 4 small species. The results show that their resistance evaluation scores are 3 and 4, disease levels are ‘susceptible’ and ‘high sensitivity’ respectively. We conclude that ‘HD-1’ has stronger resistance ability toFusarium wilt than Brazil banana. © 2016, Pakistan Botanical Society. All rights reserved.

Ethnopharmacological relevance Musa acuminata, the wild species of banana is a plant of the tropical and subtropical regions. Over the past few decades, the health benefits of M. acuminata have received much attention. All parts of the plant including fruits, peel, pseudostem, corm, flowers, leaves, sap and roots have found their use in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. Literature review have indicated use of M. acuminata in the treatment of various diseases such as fever, cough, bronchitis, dysentery, allergic infections, sexually transmitted infections, and some of the non-communicable diseases. The reported pharmacological activities of M. acuminata include antioxidant, antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, hypolipidemic, anticancer, and antimicrobial especially anti-HIV activity. This review presents information on the phytochemicals and pharmacological studies to validate the traditional use of different parts of M. acuminata in various diseases and ailments. A comprehensive assessment of the biological activities of M. acuminata extracts is included and possible mechanisms and phytochemicals involved have also been correlated to provide effective intervention strategies for preventing or managing diseases. Materials and methods A literature search was performed on M. acuminata using ethnobotanical textbooks, published articles in peer-reviewed journals, local magazines, unpublished materials, and scientific databases such as Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. The Plant List, Promusa, Musalit, the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) databases were used to validate the scientific names and also provide information on the subspecies and cultivars of M. acuminata. Result and discussion The edible part of M. acuminata provides energy, vitamins and minerals. All other parts of the plant have been used in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. The rich diversity of phytochemicals present in them probably contributes to their beneficial effects, and validates the role of M. acuminata plant parts used by various tribes and ethnic groups across the geographical areas of the world. Conclusion This review presents information on phytochemicals and pharmacological activities of M. acuminata plant parts. Pharmacological studies support the traditional uses of the plant, and probably validate the uses of M. acuminata by the indigenous people to treat and heal many infections and diseases. Some studies on animal models have been carried out, which also provide evidence of efficacy of the M. acuminata plant as a therapeutic agent. These observations suggest that M. acuminata plant parts possesses pluripharmacological properties, and can be used in designing potent therapeutic agents. However, individual bioactive constituent(s) from different parts of this plant need further investigations to confirm various pharmacological claims, and to explore the potential of M. acuminata in the development of drugs and use in functional foods. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd

This work focused on the morphological characterization of plantain cultivars collected in the period 2005–2014 in 280 villages across 9 provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo. These cultivars were established in two field collections at the University of Kisangani.Existing descriptors were adapted to better differentiate their variation to address better the taxonomic handicap and the synonymy handicap to improve future research on plantains.Most of the collected cultivars were French plantains (64 out of 98), followed by False Horn (23) and Horn (10) plantains. The bunch type was the main striking difference which allows the quick separation of plantain cultivars into three main types. Other striking differences within plantain were the size of the pseudostem (giant, medium-sized and small-sized) and the bunch orientation (which was generally pendulous or sub-horizontal, and rarely horizontal and erect). These three descriptors were considered as main descriptors. Other descriptors (pseudostem colour, immature fruit peel colour, fruit shape, fruit apex, fruit position, number of hands, fruit size, number of fingers per hand and flower relicts at the fruit apex) allowed the differentiation of one cultivar from another within the same main group of bunch type, pseudostem size or bunch orientation. These descriptors are considered as secondary descriptors. Rare descriptors allowed to differentiate one cultivar from all the others in the subgroup. This approach makes the cultivar description logical and faster because it moves from general to particular characteristics, and it offers a platform for reflections on the Pan-African scale of plantain diversity © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents the morphological classification of 19 Musa species and cultivars. Fifteen morphological characters for Musa acuminata and M. balbisiana and 50 morphological characters adapted from International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plant (UPOV) codes were employed to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship between both banana species. Analyses of genetic similarity based on all of these morphological characters suggested that bananas with A-genomes were in the same cluster. Moreover, a genetic similarity coefficient of 0.36 was obtained between M. acuminata and M. balbisiana in the analysis with the 15 morphological characters for both species, and 0.47 in the analysis with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) of the 15 morphological characters suggested that PCI and PC2 together explained 78.6% of the total variance. A PCA with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that PCI explained 80.6% of the total variance, for which the main variables were pseudostem length, leaf blade length, and peduncle length. PCA of the 15 morphological characters showed that 'Pei Chiao', 'Giant Cavendish', and 'Dwarf Cavendish' were proximal in the PCA scatterplot. Notably, the PCA of 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that 'Pei Chiao' and 'Giant Cavendish' were near each other in the PCA scatterplot, suggesting that they are phylogenetically related. The PCA of M. itinerans var.formosana with 15 morphological descriptors showed that this variant is phylogenetically distant from M. acuminata and M. balbisiana accessions. In summary, the findings may contribute to the classification and breeding of banana germplasm. © 2018 Kyushu University. All rights reserved.

Background: Inflorescence dichotomy in Musa species is a rare developmental event which leads to the production of multiple bunches on a single pseudostem at fruiting. In spite of its fascinating attraction and seductive appeal, little is known about the cytogenetic basis and molecular mechanisms that could be ascribed to this phenomenon. To bridge this gap in information, an integrative approach using cytological fingerprinting and DNA ploidy level profiling (based on chromosome counting and flow cytometry) were assayed on five inflorescence dichotomous plantain varieties and a single-bunching cultivar that served as control. This was done to assess the number and behaviour of chromosomes on the one hand and single nucleotide polymorphisms identified during analysis of nucleotide variations on the other. Results: Chromosomes stained with aceto-orcein were very tiny, compact, metacentric and acrocentric, and differed both in number and ploidy level between the inflorescence dichotomous and single-bunching cultivars. The dichotomous plantains were mainly diploid (2n = 2x = 22) while the single-bunching 'Agbagba' cultivar was consistently a triploid (2n = 3x = 33), as revealed by histological chromosome counting and flow cytometry, implying that there was a high incidence of genomic divergence on account of ploidy variations among the different Musa cultivars. Molecular genotyping using single nucleotide polymorphisms detected on the GTPase-protein binding gene of the leaf tissue gene complex provided further evidence indicating that differences in the number of bunches among the inflorescence dichotomous cultivars could be ascribed to nucleotide diversity that was elicited by changes in amino acid sequences in the genome of the crops. Non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions resulted mainly from transversion (from purine to pyramidine and vice versa), tacitly implying that these changes were crucial and promoted a cascade of reactions in the genome that were, probably, responsible for the non-persistence of the dichotomization event(s) or the reversals in the bunch phenotype detected among the inflorescence dichotomous cultivars. Conclusions: This is the first report of cytogenetic fingerprints and nucleotide diversity detection among single- and multiple-bunching Musa cultivars. A clear distinction between the two groups was found that is indicative of variations both in ploidy level and nucleotide sequences. The pattern of single nucleotide polymorphisms provided profound clues suggesting that there was a high incidence of genomic divergence, due to random and unstable genetic events that were triggered by frequent spontaneous somatic mutations. © 2019 The Author(s).

Ensete ventricosum is a traditional multipurpose crop mainly used as a staple/co-staple food for over 20 million people in Ethiopia. Despite this, scientific information about the crop is scarce. Three types of food, viz., Kocho (fermented product from scraped pseudostem and grated corm), Bulla (dehydrated juice), and Amicho (boiled corm) can be prepared from enset. These products are particularly rich in carbohydrates, minerals, fibres, and phenolics, but poor in proteins. Such meals are usually served with meat and cheese to supplement proteins. As a food crop, it has useful attributes such as foods can be stored for long time, grows in wide range of environments, produces high yield per unit area, and tolerates drought. It has an irreplaceable role as a feed for animals. Enset starch is found to have higher or comparable quality to potato and maize starch and widely used as a tablet binder and disintegrant and also in pharmaceutical gelling, drug loading, and release processes. Moreover, enset shows high genetic diversity within a population which in turn renders resilience and food security against the ever-changing environmental factors and land use dynamics. Therefore, more research attention and funding should be given to magnify and make wider use of the crop. © 2020 Getahun Yemata.

Plantain (Musa spp. AAB genome) is a major staple with an incredibly enormous potential for domestic and global trade that can serve as a vital source of income for many developing countries. The fruits are extraordinarily significant, providing an important and cheap source of dietary energy, vitamins, and several essential minerals to millions of consumers within the humid and sub-humid tropics. As molecular characterization is important for sustainable exploitation of crops, the extent of genetic and agro-morphological differentiation in a large Musa population of 109 accessions was evaluated using 10 microsatellite (SSR) markers and 14 morphotaxonomic descriptors, as a basis for selection of high yielding varieties. Measurement of DNA diversity delineated the plantains into 2 major groups and 8 distinct clusters, each with several sub-clusters. There was equally a very wide diversity detected in morphotaxonomic traits including pseudostem girth, number of bunches per plant, number of hands per bunch, number of fruits per bunch, number of fruits per hand, bunch weight, length of plant cycle, and flowering to harvest interval, which varied significantly (p < 0.05) amongst the accessions. Selection based on cluster analysis using standard morphological data also delineated the cultivars into 8 distinct clusters, with one of these containing samples that were most distant to all others and exhibited a 'double bunching' phenotype at fruiting; tacitly implying the presence of significant variability that symbolizes an excellent opportunity to bring about genetic improvement through selection of improved varieties. Principal component analysis based on morphotaxonomic traits revealed 7 attributes which contributed to 79.95% of total variation that was quite similar to the 71.87% detected using microsatellite fingerprinting. Correlation analysis between selected agronomic traits demonstrated that pseudostem girth was positively associated with bunch weight, number of hands per bunch, number of fruits per bunch, number of fruits per hand, and flowering to harvest interval across all accessions. Collectively, the data in this study suggest that plantain accessions with very unique traits expressing paramount horticultural significance are available within the diverse germplasm evaluated and are currently being collected for future breeding purposes to broaden the genetic base of this important crop. © 2020, Prof. H.S.

This investigation was carried out during the two successive seasons of 2016 and 2017 at the private orchard of the modern agriculture company (PICO), El Behera governorate, Egypt, to study the effect of Nitrogen Fixing Bacteria (NFB) and Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) and different rates of N and P as mineral fertilizers (i.e. 50% and 75% of recommended dose), compared to the standard recommended mineral fertilization on the growth, yield, fruit quality and leaf mineral contents of Williams banana plants. Results showed that T8 (50% bio N + 50% bio. P + 50% mineral N and P) and T7 (100% bio N + 50% bio. P + 50% mineral N and P) enhanced plant growth i.e. pseudostem length and perimeter also, it increased bunch weight and yield and improved most physical parameters (i.e. finger no./hand, finger length, finger weight, pulp weight, pulp weight and pulp ratio) and chemical characters (T.S.S, total sugar % and reducing sugar %), leaf mineral content (N, P, and K) and chlorophyll a and b were also significantly affected by treatments compared to the control during two season of study. The results suggest that, the utilized biofertilizers can partially substitute the amount of mineral fertilizers, leading to cleaner environment. © 2020, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.

The present cultivated enset (Ensete ventricosum) clonal landraces in Ethiopia originated from few wild progenitors. However, enset has a mixed mode of reproduction in which, the wild enset reproduces sexually through seeds, while cultivated enset is generally propagated vegetatively. The objectives of this study were to determine the genetic structure of enset cultivars through genetic analysis of qualitative morphological traits and estimate their genetic variability by evaluating the quantitative agronomic traits data generated from progenies of cultivated and wild enset genotypes. Hence, seeds collected from six cultivated and four wild enset genotypes were used for this study. Data on four qualitative and six quantitative morphological traits were recorded from the progenies of the 10 enset genotypes. Progenies of seven enset genotypes segregated in a 3:1 segregation ratio while progenies of the remaining genotypes segregated differently for the qualitative traits considered. With regard to the quantitative traits, the progenies of the 10 enset genotypes differed significantly for five of the six traits except pseudostem length. The cultivated clones, in general performed better than that of the wild types. Moderate heritability (h2b) estimates and high genetic advances were obtained for leaf length (0.38, 62.0%), pseudostem circumference (0.35, 78.5%), and plant height (0.30, 19.1%) indicating selection for these traits indirectly improves economic yield of enset clones. This study demonstrated the possibility of creating genetic variation through selfing the existing enset genotypes for traits of interest and making improvements either through selection or crossing the elite types to develop novel enset cultivars. © 2021 Indonesian Journal of Agricultural Science.

Managing seasonal production variations is sometimes necessary for banana plantations. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a modified pruning, with selection of later successor suckers for the production units, on the growth, harvest time, and bunch weight of 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana plants, when compared to conventional pruning. A completely randomized experimental design was used, with two treatments and ten replicates for the conduction of two experiments, one for each cultivar. The treatments consisted of conventional pruning and modified pruning (selection of later successor suckers). Conventional pruning was carried out maintaining the successor sucker (daughter plant), whose growth was evaluated until the flowering stage. Modified pruning was carried out with the removal of the successor sucker (daughter plant) after the flowering of the mother plant, and the subsequent successor sucker (granddaughter plant) was selected and grown as the daughter plant. The growth of the first and second suckers were quantified at intervals of approximately 60 days and the bunch weight and other production variables were determined. The pruning reduced the height and pseudostem perimeter of the first successor sucker and delayed the harvest time in at least 30 days without reducing bunch weight of both banana cultivars. The mean yields were 26.68 and 50.64 Mg ha-1for the 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana, respectively, regardless of the pruning management used. The second sucker of 'Nanica' banana presented a residual effect of the pruning on plant height, but not on production. The use of the modified pruning is feasible for changing harvest time of both cultivars. However, repeatedly use of this technique for the same production unit is not recommended, since it affects the h eight of the second successor sucker. © 2021 Federal University ofPiauI.

The present study identified the different abaca (Musa textilis Nee) cultivars grown in the 34 identified abaca producing barangays of Madalag and Libacao, Aklan, Philippines, and evaluated the morphological characteristics of the matured abaca plant such as plant height, number of suckers, number of leaves, the circumference of pseudostem and length of stalks. Stratified random sampling was conducted. From the two municipalities, there were 34 abaca-producing barangays identified, and three abaca plantations were randomly selected to obtain the morphological characteristics of the different abaca cultivars using the prescribed measurement procedures. Distribution of the cultivars determined through geospatial mapping using Geographic Information System (GIS). Statistical analyses employed were single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) and T-test to determine significant differences among groups/cultivars at α = 0.05 level of significance. The findings showed that there were four identified abaca cultivars commonly grown in Madalag and Libacao. These were Bisaya, Tabukanon, Agbayanon and Negro cultivars. Moreover, the morphological performance of the different cultivars responded differently. The study will provide relevant data on the distribution and morphological characteristics of abaca cultivars in the province. It could enhance programs and interventions in achieving the local and global demand for high-quality abaca fiber. © 2022 by authors.

In the banana crop, leaf area is a fundamental trait for produc-tion; however, monitoring this variable during a cycle is difficult due to the structural characteristics of the plant, and a method for its determination is necessary. Therefore, the objective of this research was to propose a model for estimating total leaf area by measuring the cross-sectional area of the pseudostem to identify when meristematic differentiation occurs. In plants between F10 and f lowering, functional leaves were measured for length, width, and dry mass. Cross-sectional area was calculated every 10 cm from the base to 70 cm, at ⅓, ½ of the plant height and up to the last pair of leaves. From the principal compo-nents, the cross-sectional measurement at 50 cm was selected, obtaining a nonlinear model for indirect estimation of leaf area. Subsequently, Fisher’s linear discriminant analysis was used with the parameters associated with the number of leaves emitted and the estimated leaf area to obtain the cutoff point as the centroid of the extracted components. As an indicator for the approximate identification of the moment of meristem differentiation, the emission of leaf 12 was generated, which determines the phenological stage (vegetative-reproductive) of the plant. The results describe tools to follow up the growth in the productive units to facilitate crop monitoring, allowing the generation of differential production approaches. © 2022, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

Morphological traits are routinely used to characterize the banana varieties but are unable to precisely discriminate the closely resembling ones. Current study explores the five common banana varieties using 41 qualitative traits and discriminating traits are shortlisted based on uniformity within variety (zero Shannon index), differences between varieties (varying mode scores across varieties and significant binomial distribution of mode class from non-mode class). Five traits at vegetative stage (leaf habit, leaf blotch color, color of midrib leaf dorsal surface, petiole canal area, and pigment under pseudostem) are useful as unique descriptors for quick discrimination of five banana varieties at 62.5–100% accuracy levels. © 2021, The National Academy of Sciences, India.

The yield, plant characteristics (pseudostem height and girth), and relative tolerance to bunch loss of 4 banana varieties (Musa AAA Group, Cavendish subgroup) were studied over 2 crops in the semi-arid subtropics at Carnarvon, Western Australia. The varieties were New Guinea Cavendish, Chinese Cavendish, Hsien.Jen Chiao, and the most widely grown Australian variety, Williams. The marketable yield of Williams was higher (P<0.05) than the mean of the other varieties in the parent crop (70.2 v. 50.7 t/ha) and ratoon 1 crop (65.8 v. 34.4 t/ha). This was the result of lower (P<0.05) bunch loss, about 41% less over the 2 crops, than for the other varieties. Resistance to bunch loss-pseudostem breakage and bunch peduncle snap was not associated with the shorter varieties (New Guinea Cavendish and Chinese Cavendish), but resistance to choke throat was associated with the taller varieties (Williams and Hsien Jen Chiao). © 1992 ASEG.

Banana weevil females laid on an average 2.7 eggs/week in rhizome material and 0.7 eggs/week in pseudostem material in the laboratory. At extremely high weevil population densities the egg‐laying activity declined. Under controlled field conditions 0.7 eggs/week were laid in banana suckers and 1.3 eggs/week in stumps of harvested suckers. 25% of the weevil stages found in suckers in the field were eggs of which 78% were laid in the rhizome and 22% in the pseudostem base. The majority of eggs was deposited in the crown area of the rhizome followed by the remaining surface area of the rhizome, the walls of abandoned larval tunnels in rhizome and pseudostem and the leaf sheaths. 58% of the eggs found were considered accessible to egg predators. 1993 The Netherlands Entomological Society

During examination of banana suckers in western Kenya egg predators of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus were regularly found in the pest's egg‐laying sites, viz. on the surface of the rhizome and the pseudostem base as well as inside abandoned larval tunnels. Under experimental conditions at high pest and predator densities Eutochia pulla (Erichs.) (Col., Tenebrionidae), Euborellia annulipes (Luc.) (Dermapt., Carcinophoridae) and Dactylosternum abdominale (F.) (Col., Hydrophilidae) reduced weevil multiplication in banana suckers through egg predation by 20.5 %, 28 % and 44 %, respectively. D. abdominale was similarly effective also at lower weevil and predator densities.

The influence of windbreak shading was investigated over the plant crop (P) and first ratoon (R1) cycle of bananas cv. Dwarf Cavendish, to quantify its effects on assimilation, phenology and yield in the subtropics. Plants growing under seasonal windbreak shading (late autumn to early spring) were compared with those growing under full sun but under similar windbreak protection. Windbreak shading reduced average photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) by 69%, which in turn reduced photosynthesis rate by 27%, transpiration rate by 38% and stomatal conductance by 40% compared with plants growing in full sun. Pseudostem temperature was 2.1 K lower on plants growing in shade. This led to a reduction in monthly leaf emergence rate and an extended cycle time. An additional extension to cycle time was caused by the extra 3.4 leaves produced before flowering on plants growing under windbreak shading. The decreased photosynthesis of leaves growing in shade was partially compensated for in the P cycle by an extended flowering to harvest interval, resulting in no loss of bunch mass. However, bunch mass was significantly reduced in the R1 cycle, when flower to harvest intervals were similar. The most significant effect of windbreak shading was therefore a cumulative 10.6% extension in cycle time over the two crop cycles. The effect of a longer cycle and reduced bunch mass in the R1, caused by windbreak shading, resulted in an overall reduction of 13% in annual yield per ha, compared with plants growing in full sun.

Two bean (Phaseollus vulgaris L.) cultivars, Arroyo Loro and DOR 364, and four lines, 9443-1, 9443-8, 9443-33, 9226-17, were intercropped once or twice with one cycle of plantain cultivar Maricongo at the AES-UPR Corozal substation during 1994-1995. The first cycle of beans intercropped at the time of plantain planting produced a high yield. The second cycle of beans intercropped two months before the termination of plantain harvest yielded poorly. The height of intercropped plantain plants was less than that of non-intercropped plantain plants (P < 0.05) at six months after planting. However, at 12 months, there was no height difference between them. There was no significant difference in diameter of pseudostem, nor in number of leaves, between the intercropped and the non-intercropped plantain plants. Plantain yields, in terms of number of fruits and bunch weight, were not significantly affected by the intercropping (P < 0.05). The highest net income of the intercropping treatment was derived from the first cycle of the bean line 9443-1 ($7,646/ha). This net income represents an additional income of $4,894/ha beyond that of plantain monoculture.

A dwarf variant (TC1-229) of banana resistant to race 4 of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense was identified from a tall, resistant Cavendish cultivar, 'Tai Chiao No. 1'. This study showed that the dwarf characteristic of TC1-229 was retained over 4 clonal generations. Although 3% of tissue-cultured plants of TC1-229 were found to be a tall reversion, the dwarf characteristic of TC1-229 appears to be a relatively stable genetic trait. The average pseudostem height of TC1-229 in the plant crop was 229 cm which was about 62 cm shorter than its source plant. TC1-229 retained the resistance to fusarium wilt in a wide range of environments. Unlike Dwarf Cavendish, the leaf bases of TC1-229 were not crowded and the bunch stalk was normal, thus 'choking' was not observed. This study shows that the step-wise selection of beneficial traits by using somaclonal variation can be useful in banana improvement.

Disease severity associated with the pathogen Fusarium oxysporum is generally thought to be proportional to the population of fungal propagules in the soil. However, results from studies using naturally infested soil are contradictory, implicating host predisposition to disease. In this study, soil was amended with chicken manure to investigate the interdependence between the activity and invasiveness of the pathogen, and the incidence of Panama disease in susceptible banana plantlets. Two soil types naturally infested with either race 1 or race 4 of the pathogen, and cultivars Lady finger and Grande Naine, were used. Pathogen activity was measured by burying root tip segments for 5 days, then calculating the frequency of isolation of Fusarium from the segments. Pathogen invasion was measured by transplanting banana plantlets into trays of amended and unamended soil for 4 weeks, then calculating the frequency of recovery of Fusarium from each pseudostem. Amending both soil types with chicken manure enhanced both pathogen invasion and disease incidence. However, pathogen activity was not correlated with either parameter. We postulate that the addition of chicken manure is predisposing banana plantlets to Panama disease, by reducing the efficacy of the host wound response.

The effects of host and non-host plant odours on the foraging responses of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), were investigated in the laboratory through arena and olfactometer bioassays. Contrary to previous reports that banana rhizome and pseudostem were the most attractive parts to the weevil, dead leaves were most preferred. Comparison of dead banana leaves with dead leaves of other plants showed that attractant odours were present in yam, cocoyam and dead grasses but absent in cocoa and soybean leaves. Complete leaf senescence while the leaf was attached to the mother plant proved necessary for the development of the dead-leaf-based odours but the involvement of microbial organisms could not be demonstrated. It is possible that dead-leaf-based attractants could be used in combination with microbials such as entomogenous fungi and nematodes in integrated management of C. sordidus.

The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development. Host plant resistance offers another promising avenue of control. Numerous resistant clones are known, including Yangambi-km 5, Calcutta 4, and Pisang awak. Resistance is most often through antibiosis resulting in egg or larval failure. Banana breeding is a slow and difficult process. Current research is exploring genetic improvement through biotechnology techniques including the introduction of foreign genes. Neem has also shown potential for control of banana weevil. Studies on the use of other botanicals against banana weevil have failed to produce positive results. Chemical control of banana weevil remains a common and effective method for larger scale producers but is beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers. However, the weevil has displayed the ability to develop resistance against a broad range of chemicals. In summary, cultural control remains the most available approach for resource-poor farmers. A combination of several cultural methods is likely to reduce weevil pressure. Among the methods currently under study, microbial control, host plant resistance and neem appear to offer the most promise.

Two cDNAs, designated MWPL1 and MWPL2, encoding putative pectate lyases (Pel; EC 4.2.2.2), which catalyze the cleavage by β-elimination of α-1 → 4-linked galacturonosyl residues of pectins found mostly in middle lamella and primary cell wall in plants, were isolated from ripening fruit of banana (Musa acuminata) and their expressions in fruit during ripening and in response to ethylene were investigated. MWPL1 and MWPL2 encode a single polypeptide of 407 and 454 amino acid residues, respectively. The two cDNAs shared an overall identity of 75% in both nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences. Sequence comparison of MWPL1 and other plant Pels revealed the homology ranging from 76% with zinnia to 48% with ragweed. Southern analysis indicated that MWPL1 might be present as a single copy gene, and there might be up to two copies of MWPL2 in the banana genome. The two cDNAs were expressed differentially and/or spatially in various banana organs, with female flower and fruit tissues showing accumulation of the MWPL2 transcript, which was not detected in root, pseudostem, leaf, male flower and ovary, whereas the MWPL1 transcript was not detectable in all organs tested. In fruit tissue during ripening, although transcripts of both members were not detectable in unripe preclimacteric fruits, they began to accumulate as ripening progressed and the level remained high thereafter in overripe fruits. However, the magnitude of transcript accumulation differed between the two Pel members, with substantially more abundant MWPL2 than MWPL1 in ripening fruit. Similar differential transcript accumulation was also observed between peel and pulp, where the former was markedly higher than the latter. Expression of both Pel members was also affected by exogenous ethylene, whose presence at 5-100 ppm stimulated accumulation of MWPL1 and MWPL2 transcripts in preclimacteric fruit, suggesting that ethylene may play an important regulatory role in regulating Pel expression during fruit ripening of the banana.

To compare the mineral nutrition of organically and normally grown banana plants, observations were made on growth and yield of organic banana plants, at the Canary Islands. The data were then discussed opposite the results previously reported for conventional plantations. Materials and methods. Growth parameters (plant height, leaf emission rate, pseudostem circumference) and yield parameters (bunch weight, number of hands, finger grade, etc.) were measured during ten months on an organically grown banana plantation of Dwarf Cavendish cv. Leaf N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn contents were also assessed. Results and discussion. Leaf emission rates showed higher values in late spring and early summer (0.099-0.109 leaf.d-1), while pseudostem circumference grew more in late spring (0.238 cm.d-1) than in summer. In August, pseudostem circumference decreased dramatically, probably because the plants with a larger circumference had flowered before that month and could not be measured. Bunches gave good yields for the zone (43.59 kg on average) and had a high mean number of hands (12.79). Number of fingers of the second upper hand (25.63), their grade (37.63 cm), length (23.50 cm) and weight (165.19 g) ranged from normal to high. Month of harvesting influenced yield and quality of the fruits. Leaf content of N, P, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn fell within the normal range related to the conventionally grown banana plants. Potassium foliar content showed low levels but not deficiencies, whereas Ca leaf concentrations were high but not excessive. No relationship was found among leaf nutrient levels and growth, yield and fruit quality parameters. © 2001 Cirad/EDP Sciences.

An experiment was established to characterize twenty-seven locally selected and introduced plantain clones. The clones were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Twenty morphological descriptors were used to obtain information of the plant, bunch and individual fruits at bunch-emergence and at harvest. The clones were first organized into two main groups on the basis of their genomic constitution: true plantain (Musa AAB) and cooking banana (Musa ABB, AAAB). Within the second group, we included three Musa AAB clones that are considered distinctive cooking bananas because the M. acuminata species responsible for the donation of the A genome had its origin in the Pacific and not in Asia. In each main group the clones were subdivided into true-horn, false-horn and French on the basis of bunch phenotype. Clones in these three subgroups were further subdivided into tall and dwarf, depending on the height of the pseudostem. After the clones were organized into this classification, statistical comparisons were made between or among those corresponding to the same subdivision, utilizing the data obtained from the plant, bunch and individual fruit traits. This scheme is easy to implement in the field, provides for the clustering and separation of clones regardless of their geographical origin and common names, and offers the opportunity for agronomists and horticulturists to learn about the economic potential of the clones from the outset. The application of this scheme will allow the number of plantain accessions in the TARS collection to be reduced from 27 to 20 clones.

The spatial location of the banana (Musa AAA) root parasitic nematodes within three root parts considering two root thickness was determined in three commercial farm management systems, which differ in weed and nematode management. Roots in each farm management system were classified in thick (>5 mm-d) and thin (1 ≤ 5 mm-d) roots. From each root type, the epidermis, the cortical parenchyma (CP) and the vascular cylinder (VC) were separated by fingernail, and nematodes were extracted by maceration of each root part. Independent of the farm management system, and for either root thickness, highest numbers of Radopholus similis per gram of root was found in the CP, followed by the epidermis and VC. The highest number of Helicotylencus spp., Pratylenchus spp. and the total nematode population per gram of root was found in the epidermis. Considering the number of nematodes per root part, the highest number of R. similis and total nematodes was located in the CP, while Helicotylenchus spp. and Pratylenchus spp. were concentrated in the epidermis. These patterns were approximately reproduced in the two root thickness and in the three farm management systems. This behavior suggests that injection of systemic nematicides into the plant pseudostem to replace the granular applications on surface soil might be promissory. © 2004 Elsevier SAS.

Sterility has profound effects on the development of reproductive tissues in members of the Musaceae and limits genetic improvement required to deal with new diseases. Ovules of seeded diploid Musa acuminata (AA) and edible triploids (AAA) from the same cytogenetic group, plus edible triploids containing genomes of the M. balbisiana cytogenetic group (AAB, ABB) and the related genus Ensete sp. were studied to determine the effects of sterility on the growth and development of the ovule and its tissues. Specimens were collected from subtropical and Mediterranean environments in Australia. At anthesis, the ovules of triploid plants were 36% larger than the ovules of diploid plants. The diploid ovules ceased growth shortly after the inflorescence emerged from the pseudostem. In contrast, the triploid ovules continued to grow 7-10 days past anthesis, increasing in size by 70%. All ovules of diploid M. acuminata ssp. had an embryo sac at anthesis, against 97% for triploids. At anthesis the embryo sacs in diploid ovules occupied 2.7% of the nucellus compared with 1.5% in triploid ovules. The embryo sacs did not grow between bunch emergence and anthesis, once formed they maintained the same size. Many embryo sacs were not positioned correctly, flush with the nucellar cap. The diploid M. acuminata ssp. had 75% of embryo sacs correctly positioned against 10% in the edible triploids. The proportion of balbisiana genome (B) did not affect ovule or nucellus size or shape, or cell number across the nucellus. It increased the embryo sac presence 96-100% of ovules. The sterile edible triploid bananas have embryo sacs at anthesis but many are incorrectly positioned, which may contribute to their sterility. The balbisiana genome in the edible triploids was associated with a 2.4-fold increase in the number of correctly positioned embryo sacs and this may contribute to the increased fertility associated with the B genome. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of weed management on banana (Musa AAA cv. Grande Naine) parasitic nematodes was evaluated under Costa Rican field conditions with special reference to their spatial distribution and the damage caused to roots of different thickness classes and their relation to yield losses. Root samples were taken at plant harvest, from soil blocks at 0-30,30-60 and 60-90 cm from the pseudostem, and at every 15 cm depth, from 0 to 120 cm. Weed management neither affected the nematode numbers nor their horizontal and vertical distribution and associated root damage. Differences in Radopholus similis (P<0.0001), Helicotylenchus spp. (P=0.0115) and total nematode populations (P<0.0001) were found in roots of different thickness. The average populations in thick, thin and fine roots were for R. similis 270,666 (57%), 120,401 (25%) and 11,313 (2%); for Helicotylenchus spp. 36,094 (7%), 22,508 (5%) and 8,824 (2%); and total nematodes 390,425 (65%), 145,534 (31%) and 21,177 (4%), respectively. No linear correlations were found between bunch weight and the number and density of nematodes or with their damage. Even though, no statistical difference was found in bunch weight, the manual weed control plot yielded 1.4 kg heavier bunches, which might have important implications for sustainable agriculture. The implementation of weed control by hand chopping may improve the physical, chemical and biological soil properties and reduce soil erosion, temperature fluctuations, evaporation rate, and nutrient leaching, and increase water infiltration. As a consequence of the decrease in herbicide applications, soil and air pollution might be reduced. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A morphological variant obtained from in vitro corm-derived plants of banana (Musa sp.) cv. Grande Naine (AAA) was evaluated up to harvest, and the genetic basis of variation was confirmed by the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The corms formed during the multiplication phase of shoot tip-derived cultures of the cv. Grande Naine grown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium enriched with 13.3 μM N6-benzyladenine (BA) developed numerous morphological variants after transfer to MS medium with 6.66 μM BA. The variant designated as CUDBT-B1, with distinct morphological features, was further evaluated. The morphological features of CUDBT-B1 were variegated leaf, pseudostem, bracts, ovary of the male flower and fruits, reduced height, decreased lamina length and breadth, and early flowering. These features were also manifested in the second-cycle progeny of CUDBT-B1. RAPD assay showed a marker DNA band of 1650 bp, and differential band intensity between the CUDBT-B1 and normal clone. CUDBT-B1 was multiplied using shoot tip culture, and the shoots were rooted on half-strength MS medium supplemented with 2.69 μM α-naphthaleneacetic acid.

In order to identify the effect of burrowing nematodes on the shoots (pseudostem and leaves) of banana plants and to determine whether or not shoot characteristics are associated with plant resistance to nematodes two experiments were conducted in controlled conditions within polytunnels. The banana plants were harvested on three occasions for the measurement of root morphology and biomass. Varieties differed in their resistance to nematodes from resistant (Yg Km5, FHIA 17, FHIA 03) and partly resistant (FHIA 01, FHIA 25) to not resistant (FHIA 23, Williams). Nematodes reduced total plant dry weight at the first harvest in Experiment 1 and by an average of 8.8% in Experiment 2, but did not affect leaf area in either experiment. The ratio of above-ground weight to total plant weight was reduced from 75% to 72% in nematode-infected plants compared with the control plants for all varieties tested in Experiment 1, but was only reduced in FHIA 25 and FHIA 23 in Experiment 2. Varieties differed in above-ground growth. The FHIA varieties had greater shoot weights and leaf area than YgKm5 and Williams. Overall, resistance to nematodes was associated with the partitioning of a greater proportion of biomass to the roots than to above-ground parts. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

Plantain production (Musa spp.) in Central and South America and the Caribbean is affected by bacterial diseases. In Puerto Rico, production of the plantain 'Hua Moa' is affected by a condition known as bunch abortion or 'choke neck'. This condition in some cases is accompanied by soft rot symptoms and therefore could be related to phytopathogenic bacteria. The purpose of this study was to identify the bacteria related to the soft rot tissues on plants affected with the bunch abortion symptoms and determine their virulence in other clones of plantain and banana. Bacterial colonies were isolated from pseudostems of Hua Moa at three locations in Puerto Rico, using semi-selective and nutritive agar media. The pathogenicity was determined by using potato and plantain pseudostem discs in humid chambers under in vitro conditions. Pathogenic bacteria were identified by using the BIOLOG® system. Under greenhouse conditions, the virulence of Burkholderia gladioli, Pseudomonas spinosa, Erwinia chrysanthemi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was confirmed on plantain (Maricongo, FIAH-121, Enano Común, and Hua Moa) and banana (Grand Nain) using a scale from 1 to 9. All clones evaluated under greenhouse conditions were susceptible to E. chrysanthemi, potential causal agent of soft rot in Hua Moa plantain once the bunch abortion appears. Burkholderia gladioli is reported for the first time affecting plantain and banana.This bacterium was more virulent in Hua Moa and Grand Nain clones with severity of 7 and 5, respectively, than in Maricongo, severity 3. Pseudomonas spinosa and P. aeruginosa produced less damage with severity less than 4, than E. chrysanthemi and B. gladioli with severity greater than 4. This research was conducted under in vitro and greenhouse conditions and demonstrates that the most important bacteria causing soft rot in plants with the choke neck condition are E. chrysanthemi and B. gladioli. It is recommended to conduct field studies using plants up to the reproductive stage to determine whether these bacteria are also related as causal agents of the choke neck.

An agronomic study was conducted to evaluate three Musa hybrids (BITA-3 - cooking banana, FHIA-21 and CRBP-39- both hybrid plantains) with five hundred farmers in the two Assin districts in the Central region of Ghana. At harvest sensory evaluation was carried out on the three hybrids for use as fufu, ampesi and ripe fried plantain to access their acceptability at four locations in the two districts. The results showed that there was no significant difference (p<0.05) between the numbers of leaves at flowering among the hybrids across the locations. The hybrids showed superiority over the local check in terms of number of functional leaves from flowering to harvest. All the hybrids (FHIA-21, CRBP 39, BITA-3 and FHIA-25) exhibited stable performance in yield and growth characteristics across the locations. FHIA-25 was however late maturing (18-20 months) whereas BITA-3 was early maturing (10-12 months). Nevertheless, the bunch weight (40-50 kg) of FHIA-25 could be said to have compensated for the long crop cycle. Daughter sucker production by FHIA-25 was also low (two daughter suckers at flowering). BITA-3 was roboust and sturdy with pseudostem girth of 60 cm carrying an average bunch weight of 25 kg. All the hybrids were resistant to the black Sigatoka disease. These results suggested that the performance of the hybrids was not influenced by the seasons or locations. It implies that under good management practices, farmers would be assured of good yields irrespective of time or season of planting so long as there is adequate supply of moisture. The results of the sensory evaluation indicated that there were no significant differences (p<0.01) between FHIA-21 and CRBP-39 and the local Apantu across the location, across the parameters and the recipes assessed. FHIA-21 and CRBP-39 were the most prefened and compared favourably with the local triploids (Apantu and Apem) with BITA-3 the least preferred. The hybrids were accepted for ripe fried plantain at stages 3 and 4 of ripening. Beyond these stages of ripening, the hybrids could only be used for other processed food recipes. © 2008 Academic Journals Inc.

World production of bananas, estimated at 106 million tons (Lescot 2006), ranks fourth in agricultural production. Bananas make up the largest production of fruits and the largest international trade, more than apple, orange, grape and melon. Bananas are cultivated in more than 120 countries in tropical and subtropical zones on 5 continents. Banana products represent an essential food resource and have an important socioeconomic and ecological role. Current varieties are generally seedless triploid clones either of the single genome A from the species Musa acuminata (group AAA) or of both genomes A and B from species M. acuminata and Musa balbisiana (groups AAB and ABB). More rarely, diploid varieties (AA and AB) and tetraploid clones are encountered. There are two major channels of banana production: those cultivated for export and those reserved for local markets. The main banana varieties cultivated for export, known as Grande Naine, Poyo and Williams, belong to the monospecific triploid bananas (AAA) of the Cavendish sub-group. They differ from each other only in somatic mutations such as plant height or bunch and fruit shape. Their production relies on an intensive monoculture of the agro-industrial type, without rotation, and a high quantity of inputs. Banana cultivation for local consumption is based on a large number of varieties adapted to different conditions of production as well as the varied uses and tastes of consumers. Diploid bananas, close to the ancestral wild forms, are still cultivated in Southeast Asia. In other regions, triploid clones belonging to different sub-groups Plantain, Silk, Lujugira, Gros Michel, Pisang Awak are the most widely distributed. Bananas have many uses. They are not only consumed as fresh fruits but also cooked, like plantains. They are processed in various ways, into chips, fries, fritters, purees, jams, ketchup and alcohol (banana wine and beer have a very significant production in East Africa). The daily per capita consumption of bananas from 30 g to over 500 g in some East African countries. Apart from the fruit, other parts of the plant are also used: the pseudostem is used for its fibres and as floaters (Musa textilis or abacá) in the Philippines, and the leaves are used to make shelters or roofs or as wraps for cooking. In Thailand, the floral buds of particular varieties (Pisang Awak) are used in various culinary preparations. Some varieties are also considered to have medicinal properties. Cultivated throughout the world, bananas are threatened by several diseases and pests (Stover and Simmonds 1987; Jones 1999) that need to be taken into account for banana improvement. Various major fungal diseases are constraints in industrial production and, to a lesser degree, in local production. For example, Sigatoka disease (SD) due to Mycosphaerella musicola and black leaf streak disease (BLSD) caused by M. fijiensis result in production losses in large industrial plantations and necessitate costly pest control measures to be adopted. In certain production zones, Fusarium wilt due to the soil fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense prevents the cultivation of susceptible varieties like the Gros Michel types. Great constraints are also exerted by the nematodes Radopholus similis and several representatives of the genus pratylenchus and by the black weevil of banana, Cosmopolites sordidus. Also, viral diseases are spreading. Those of greatest concern are due to BBTV (banana bunchy top virus), CMV (cucumber mosaic virus), BSV (banana streak virus) and BBMV (banana bract mosaic virus). Chemical control measures used in intensive cultivation are not available to small banana farmers in developing countries. Furthermore, for some diseases, there is no effective chemical control. Genetic improvement has thus been focused mainly on obtaining varieties resistant to principal pests and diseases. Breeding bananas through hybridisation, which began in the 1920s, is currently being pursued at seven research centres. FHIA in Honduras is breeding banana for export as well as the cooking types (Rowe 1984). EMBRAPA-CNPMF in Brazil (Dantas et al. 1993), NRCB and TNAU in India (Sathiamoorthy et al. 2000; Krishnamoorthy and Kumar 2004) aim at breeding local types of dessert and cooking bananas. CARBAP (Jenny et al. 2003) in Cameroon and IITA (Tenkouano and Swennen 2004) in Nigeria are conducting research on plantain and banana breeding in Africa. These six research centres are mainly interested in developing new tetraploid varieties by crossing triploid varieties and wild or improved diploid clones with resistance to diseases. Some secondary triploids derived from crosses between these new tetraploid varieties and other diploid clones were also obtained. In the French West Indies, CIRAD has conceived another crossing strategy aimed at the development of triploid varieties directly from diploid plant material (Bakry et al. 2001). Since the 1980s, apart from these conventional breeding approaches, other groups have focused on mutagenesis as at IAEA (Roux 2004) in Austria or on the selection of somaclonal variants as at TBRI (Hwang and Ko 1990) in Taiwan. These technologies appeared as a result of the development of in vitro culture techniques designed for rapid industrial multiplication of micro-propagated banana plants. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

The results of research on the water relations and irrigation need of banana are collated and summarised in an attempt to link fundamental studies on crop physiology to irrigation practices. Background information on the ecology of the banana and crop development processes, with emphasis on root growth and water uptake, is presented, followed by reviews of the influence of water stress on gas exchange (stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration), crop water use, and yield. Emphasis is placed on research that has international relevance and, where appropriate, three geographical areas (the tropics, subtropics and Mediterranean climates) are considered. Although roots can extend to depths of 1.0-1.5 m, the effective depth of rooting is usually taken to be 0-0.40 m, sometimes extending to 0.60 m. Stomatal conductance is a sensitive measure of soil water availability and plant water status, whilst transpiration rates can be limited by dry air (saturation deficits &gt;2.0 kPa). In the subtropics, there are seasonal differences in the crop coefficient (Kc) with values ranging from 0.6 in the winter months to about 1.0 Epan in the summer. It is difficult to draw generic conclusions with wide applicability from the irrigation experiments as they were reported. All the components of marketable yield can be enhanced by irrigation whilst applying insufficient water delays crop development. Annual yield responses to irrigation are variable, but water use efficiencies of 40 kg ha-1 mm-1 (fresh fruit/water applied) have been achieved in the tropics and subtropics (and elsewhere up to 80 kg ha-1 mm-1 with partial replacement of the soil water deficit). To ensure large yields of (marketable) fruit, soil water deficits must be kept low (Ψm &gt;-20 kPa at 0.2 m depth). In the subtropics, this means irrigation intervals should not exceed 2-3 d during the summer. The cooling effect of irrigation with micro-sprinklers on the soil and pseudostem temperatures, compared with drippers, can delay crop development and reduce annual yields by 30%. There is some (limited) evidence that the presence of the B genome contributes to drought tolerance. Yield response factors to irrigation for different growth stages have yet to be confirmed. Opportunities to improve the water productivity of the many, diverse banana cultivars need to be explored further. © Cambridge University Press 2009.

Purpose of review: This article reviews some of the versatile postharvest uses of plantains and other components of plantain plants. Findings: Plantain belongs to the Musacace family and is cultivated in over 120 countries. Many African, Asian and Latin American countries depend primarily on the plantain plant for sustainability. Mature plantains are consumed as a staple on cooking, while overripe fruit is consumed in raw form. Plantains are rich in iron, potassium, ascorbic acid and vitamin A, and are a very good source of starch, which has various uses, such as in functional foods and edible films. In addition to plantains being used for food, the waste material such as the peel, pseudo-stem, pith, male bud and leaves, have also been used as food and feed, as well as for other special purposes in most of the plantain-growing parts of the world. Directions for future research: A plantain-based diet can be designed for diabetic people based on its low glycaemic index. Moreover, due to its high starch content and cheaper cost, it has the potential to be added to other fruit-based juices and beverages as starch filler. Further research can be done on deflavouring of plantain, which might overwhelm other fruit based beverages when added as a filler. Since most of the parts of the plantain plant have some or other therapeutic value, further research can be done to extract the phytochemicals for potential drug development.

Field performance of two IITA plantain hybrids ('PITA-1', 'PITA-4') were assessed at two locations in Ghana alongside two local landraces (False Horn 'Brodeyuo', Intermediate French 'Oniaba') and a hybrid cultivar 'Apem Hemaa' ('FHIA-21'). The objective of the study was to identify high yielding and disease resistant hybrids for growers in Ghana. The hybrids were evaluated for their agronomic performance and yield, tolerance to Black Sigatoka disease, number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest, crop cycle, plant height and pseudostem girth. The results showed that the hybrids were tolerant/resistant to the Black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) disease with high number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest. This characteristic of the hybrids was an important feature that could fit well into the smallholder cropping system. The crop cycles were comparable to that of 'False Horn' plantains. The yield performance of the hybrids was better compared to the landraces. The number of hands per bunch produced by the hybrids was also higher than those of the landraces except the intermediate French plantain ('Oniaba'). The finger lengths of the IITA hybrids were however shorter compared to the landraces and this could hinder their acceptance by consumers.

The infection of banana by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) can result in variable disease development, ranging from no symptoms to severe rotting and wilting. Understanding the infection process of Foc is a prerequisite for effective control and management of this disease. To visualise the infection process, we used a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged strain of tropical race 4 of Foc and characterised early events in infection and disease development in Cavendish plantlets. With fluorescence microscopy, the labelled strain was observed to infect roots, colonise the root mesocotyl and, finally, the plant pseudostem. These studies indicated that the preferential colonisation sites on the root surface were grooves along the junction of the epidermal cells. This resulted in mosaic patterns of infection that developed after specific epidermal and cortical cells were infected by intercellular hyphae, while surrounding cells remained free of fungus. Finally, hyphae developed inside xylem vessels of fully colonised, rotted roots. Specific infection structures, such as appressoria, were not observed. These observations clarify events that occur after Cavendish is infected by this important pathogen and provide new clues to explore infection mechanisms of Foc. More detailed knowledge of the host-pathogen interaction could help develop more efficient ways to control the disease.

This chapter describes the morphology of the musa plant and discusses the potential benefits of morphological diversity. The East African Highland bananas, also considered as the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, display a very variable pseudostem color, the intensity of which varies with environmental conditions. Thus, in the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, the pseudostem and leaf petioles tend to get darker as altitude increases. Leaf pigmentation and posture may affect photosynthetic efficiency and transpiration rates as described by Brun and Turner, but there are surprisingly not many recent studies relating leaf morphology to photosynthetic efficiency or transpiration of the existing cultivars. Continued elongation of the main stalk of the inflorescence causes the bunch to hang over, the bracts open and fall, disclosing the female flower clusters or hands. The female flowers undergo further development without being pollinated or fertilized. A comprehensive study of the root system of a wider gene pool is required to construct an ideotype target for genetic improvement of plantains and bananas. © 2011 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Fungal diseases of banana can be classed into diseases of the foliage, diseases of the root, corm and pseudostem and diseases of the fruit, including those at post harvest, such as anthracnose. Of these, the most important are the fungal disease of the foliage caused by black sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) and the wilt disease of the pseudostem caused by the four races of Panama disease (Fusarium oxysporum fm sp cubense). The monoculture of dessert bananas for urban consumption and the export trade has facilitated the spread of black sigatoka, such that serial applications of fungicides are obligatory in most production areas of the world. In addition, the production of susceptible plantains by smallholders has become unsustainable in many areas due to high costs and difficulty in applying fungicides without the use of airplanes. After the advent of Panama disease in the 20th century, wilt resistant Cavendish dessert bananas replaced the susceptible banana 'Gros Michel' as the principal bananas in the export trade; however, these plantations are now threatened by a new race of Panama disease (Tropical race 1V) which is now present and spreading in S.E. Asia. Here we review the most significant advances in both basic and applied scientific understanding of these two disease complexes which have been made in the last two decades. A full review of fungal diseases (of which there are more than 40) which affect bananas and plantains has been given in Jones [2000]. The present review deals with advances in research into the two most important diseases, black sigatoka (causal agent Mycosphaerella fijiensis) and Fusarium wilt tropical race 4 (Fusarium oxysporum f sp cubense). © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The objective of this study was to examine the molecular and phenotypic variability of 'Prata Anã' banana clones cultivated in northern Minas Gerais State. For the phenotypic and molecular characterization, the clones were collected from five properties. The morphological characterization of 20 clones was accomplished through a qualitative evaluation of 74 descriptors. For the molecular evaluations, 45 clones were collected, and 14 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA primers were used. Among the 74 morphological descriptors evaluated in the 20 'Prata Anã' banana tree clones, 53 descriptors presented in the same homogeneous class for all clones. The presence of anthocyanin in the pseudostem (ANT) and the shape (BUS) and flexion (FLX) of the bunch clearly differentiated the 'Prata Anã' banana clones from the commercial cultivar. A total of 176 bands were produced from the molecular analysis using the 14 RAPD primers; there were 116 monomorphic and 60 polymorphic bands, with an average polymorphism percentage of 52.2%. The amplification using the OPP 14 primer resulted in the greatest percentage of polymorphic bands at 88%. The dendrogram indicated that each of the 45 'Prata Anã' clones that were evaluated using RAPD markers clustered with the commercial 'Prata Anã' cultivar.

The objective of the present study was to estimate the phenotypic correlations between the number of fruits per bunch and 22 characters evaluated in banana (AA) diploid hybrids. The experiment was carried out at Embrapa Cassava and Fruits in randomized blocks with four repetitions and 11 (AA) banana diploid hybrids were evaluated. The following characteristics were evaluated: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of suckers, number of leaves during flowering, plant cycle until emission of the bunch, presence of pollen, bunch and rachis weight, yellow Sigatoka at bunch emission, number of leaves at harvest, yellow Sigatoka at bunch harvest, number of days from emission to harvest, length and diameter of stem, weight of second hand, number of hands and fruits per bunch, pedicellum fragility, length and diameter of fruit and length of pedicellum and presence of seeds. Correlation studies between the number of fruits and the other plant characteristics were carried out. These correlations varied between genotypes; therefore, it was observed that the associations between number of fruits and vegetative characteristics of plants were, in general, non-significant. However, the relationships between the number of fruits per bunch and the other production characteristics were predominantly significant.

Background:Fusarium wilt, caused by the fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), is one of the most destructive diseases of banana. Toxins produced by Foc have been proposed to play an important role during the pathogenic process. The objectives of this study were to investigate the contamination of banana with toxins produced by Foc, and to elucidate their role in pathogenesis.Methodology/Principal Findings:Twenty isolates of Foc representing races 1 and 4 were isolated from diseased bananas in five Chinese provinces. Two toxins were consistently associated with Foc, fusaric acid (FA) and beauvericin (BEA). Cytotoxicity of the two toxins on banana protoplast was determined using the Alamar Blue assay. The virulence of 20 Foc isolates was further tested by inoculating tissue culture banana plantlets, and the contents of toxins determined in banana roots, pseudostems and leaves. Virulence of Foc isolates correlated well with toxin deposition in the host plant. To determine the natural occurrence of the two toxins in banana plants with Fusarium wilt symptoms, samples were collected before harvest from the pseudostems, fruit and leaves from 10 Pisang Awak 'Guangfen #1' and 10 Cavendish 'Brazilian' plants. Fusaric acid and BEA were detected in all the tissues, including the fruits.Conclusions/Signficance:The current study provides the first investigation of toxins produced by Foc in banana. The toxins produced by Foc, and their levels of contamination of banana fruits, however, were too low to be of concern to human and animal health. Rather, these toxins appear to contribute to the pathogenicity of the fungus during infection of banana plants.

To evaluate the effect of the time of storage of propagation material on growth and production of plantain, corms were extracted from healthy plants and were peeled to eliminate roots and necrosed tissue. The half of themwas submerged during 60 minutes in a solution on basis of 15g of Carbofuran an 20g of Manzate in 10 L of water, after which, all of the corms, chemically treated and non-treated, were disposed on de soiland covered with plantain fresh leaves.Each week, during a period of 6 weeks, the required quantity of corms was taken to be planted at 3m between rows and 2m between plants in an experimental design of split plots, with four replicates and 10 plants per replication. At flowering registers of plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of functional leaves and the youngest spotted leaf were made; at harvest bunch weight was registered and the average finger weight was calculated. It was found thatstorage of the corm reduces plant growth but not affect the Sigatokas' severity; that bunch and finger weights are severe and significantly reduced and that corm preventive treatment has positive effects on plant growth and production but not reduces the damage caused by propagation material storage.

Occurrence of multiple male buds in banana is a rare phenomenon. It is caused by branching of the peduncle or differentiation of the male flower into male bud. Five types of peduncle branching occur, viz.: (i) inside the pseudostem, (ii) at the time the peduncle emerges from the pseudostem, (iii) after the peduncle emerges from the pseudostem but before fruit development, (iv) during fruit development, and (v) after fruit development. Mostly, branching is accidental, except for that produced by 'Double Mahoi' cultivar that always produces two or three bunches per pseudostem, which is inherited. Differentiation of male flower into male bud in banana is the world's first reported case. It has been found in four accessions of probably the same clone of Musa acuminata subsp. siamea cultivated by the Hmong hill-tribe villagers living on the highlands in northern Thailand as an idol of worship to obtain prolific babies as well as to obtain more male buds as food for nursing mother. After a brief female phase with almost no fruit developed, numerous male flowers, instead of withering and dropping, differentiate into male buds with long rachilla. Close to a hundred small male buds may be produced on a single pseudostem, thus the name 'Kluai Roi Pli' (banana having hundred male buds) has been given to this clone of banana. A single, normal-sized terminal male bud continues to produce male flowers, which may or may not differentiate into male buds. The values of multiple male buds are: (1) to satisfy curiosity, (2) as educational material, (3) as an idol for worship, (4) as ornamental plant, and (5) economic gain of increasing overall yield, number of fruits and male buds, and size and length of fruits.

The objective of this study was to agronomically characterize plants from induced chromosome doubling experiments in the Pisang Lilin parthenocarpic banana accession to select genotypes that will be used as 2n gamete donors in crosses with improved diploids to generate secondary triploids. Twenty-two plants were evaluated, of which 17 were autotetraploids. Compared with the original diploids, the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids showed significant increases in the plant height, number of living leaves at flowering and harvest, pseudostem diameter, and length and diameter of fruits; the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids also exhibited greater fruit and bunch weights compared with the original diploids. In addition, all autotetraploid plants did not exhibit any symptoms of yellow Sigatoka. Female fertility was also detected, as some plants produced seeds, indicating that they can be used as female parents. Therefore, the autotetraploids characterized in this study exhibited useful agronomical traits to be used as 2n gamete donors for generating secondary triploids. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Introduction. Mycosphaerella fijiensis, the fungal pathogen causing Black Sigatoka disease, attacks almost all cultivars of bananas and plantains. Currently, the repeated application of fungicides is the most widespread control measure, while the use of bio-control agents remains almost ignored. Here we investigated, under in vitro culture conditions, whether an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF - Rhizophagus irregularis MUCL 41833) could reduce the severity of disease caused by M. fijiensis MUCL 47740 on banana. Materials and methods. Prior to their transfer to autotrophic in vitro culture systems and subsequent inoculation by the pathogen, the banana plantlets cultivar Grande Naine (AAA genome Cavendish group) were grown in the extra-radical mycelium network of the AMF, arising from Medicago truncatula plantlets, for fungal root colonization. Results and discussion. At the time of infection with M. fijiensis, the AMF colonization of the banana plantlets was 12%, 56% and 10% for hyphae, arbuscules and spores/vesicles, respectively, and the number of spores produced in the medium was above 200. At day 21 and day 35 following infection by the pathogen, the number of extra-radical spores as well as the abundance of arbuscules in roots, were significantly higher than in the non-infected plantlets. Conversely, the severity index measured in the mycorrhizal plantlets decreased by more than 80% and 60%, respectively, 21 and 35 days after infection by the pathogen. Similarly, the area under disease progress curve, estimated at day 35, was reduced by 59% in the mycorrhizal banana plantlets as compared to the control plantlets. Whatever the treatment (mycorrhizal or non mycorrhizal plantlets in presence/absence of M. fijiensis), no significant differences were observed in plantlet dry weight, pseudostem height and diameter, and leaf area at both observation times. Conclusions. These results emphasize the complex multitrophic interactions between above and below-ground microorganisms mediated via the plant. They further suggest that AMF may decrease, at least at the early stage of infection, M. fijiensis symptoms possibly via the induction of a systemic resistance pathway. The important decrease in symptoms observed in the mycorrhizal banana plantlets suggest that these microorganisms may represent a potentially attractive option to consider in the context of an integrated control of this important disease. © Cirad / EDP Sciences 2015.

Bacterial diseases of bananas and enset have not received, until recently, an equal amount of attention compared to other major threats to banana production such as the fungal diseases black leaf streak (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) and Fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense). However, bacteria cause significant impacts on bananas globally and management practices are not always well known or adopted by farmers. Bacterial diseases in bananas and enset can be divided into three groups: (1) Ralstoniaassociated diseases (Moko/Bugtok disease caused by Ralstonia solanacearum and banana blood disease caused by R. syzygii subsp. celebesensis); (2) Xanthomonas wilt of banana and enset, caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum and (3) Erwinia-associated diseases (bacterial head rot or tip-over disease Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora and E. chrysanthemi), bacterial rhizome and pseudostem wet rot (Dickeya paradisiaca formerly E. chrysanthemi pv. paradisiaca). Other bacterial diseases of less widespread importance include: bacterial wilt of abaca, Javanese vascular wilt and bacterial fingertip rot (probably caused by Ralstonia spp., unconfirmed). This review describes global distribution, symptoms, pathogenic diversity, epidemiology and the state of the art for sustainable disease management of the major bacterial wilts currently affecting banana and enset. © 2017 Blomme, Dita, Jacobsen, Pérez Vicente, Molina, Ocimati, Poussier and Prior.

Ethnopharmacological relevance Musa acuminata, the wild species of banana is a plant of the tropical and subtropical regions. Over the past few decades, the health benefits of M. acuminata have received much attention. All parts of the plant including fruits, peel, pseudostem, corm, flowers, leaves, sap and roots have found their use in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. Literature review have indicated use of M. acuminata in the treatment of various diseases such as fever, cough, bronchitis, dysentery, allergic infections, sexually transmitted infections, and some of the non-communicable diseases. The reported pharmacological activities of M. acuminata include antioxidant, antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, hypolipidemic, anticancer, and antimicrobial especially anti-HIV activity. This review presents information on the phytochemicals and pharmacological studies to validate the traditional use of different parts of M. acuminata in various diseases and ailments. A comprehensive assessment of the biological activities of M. acuminata extracts is included and possible mechanisms and phytochemicals involved have also been correlated to provide effective intervention strategies for preventing or managing diseases. Materials and methods A literature search was performed on M. acuminata using ethnobotanical textbooks, published articles in peer-reviewed journals, local magazines, unpublished materials, and scientific databases such as Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. The Plant List, Promusa, Musalit, the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) databases were used to validate the scientific names and also provide information on the subspecies and cultivars of M. acuminata. Result and discussion The edible part of M. acuminata provides energy, vitamins and minerals. All other parts of the plant have been used in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. The rich diversity of phytochemicals present in them probably contributes to their beneficial effects, and validates the role of M. acuminata plant parts used by various tribes and ethnic groups across the geographical areas of the world. Conclusion This review presents information on phytochemicals and pharmacological activities of M. acuminata plant parts. Pharmacological studies support the traditional uses of the plant, and probably validate the uses of M. acuminata by the indigenous people to treat and heal many infections and diseases. Some studies on animal models have been carried out, which also provide evidence of efficacy of the M. acuminata plant as a therapeutic agent. These observations suggest that M. acuminata plant parts possesses pluripharmacological properties, and can be used in designing potent therapeutic agents. However, individual bioactive constituent(s) from different parts of this plant need further investigations to confirm various pharmacological claims, and to explore the potential of M. acuminata in the development of drugs and use in functional foods. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd

Soil management offers various options to alleviate the effects of Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) in bananas. Nevertheless, it receives little attention as a strategy in Fusarium wilt management. Literature provides ample evidence linking soil conditions such as soil texture and fertility to the spread and severity of plant diseases. However, the inconsistency of results between case studies limits the attention of soil management in crop disease management. The present study aimed at unravelling the role of soil abiotic factors on nutrient concentrations in plant tissue, biomass production and the incidence of Fusarium wilt (Foc race 1) in bananas (‘Gros Michel’, AAA) under field conditions. A large field trial was established in which the effects of soil pH and nutrients (N, Ca, Mg and Mn) were studied. Around 30% of the plants showed symptoms of Fusarium wilt at flowering in the first season. However, Fusarium wilt incidence did not vary between treatments. Soil pH showed significant interactions with soil N and Mn concentrations resulting in a lower bunch weight and increased micronutrient concentrations in the pseudostem. With a higher pH, bunch weight increased, although higher Mn concentrations suppressed this positive effect. Interactions between a high soil pH and Ca and Mg resulted in a higher bunch weight and lower micronutrient concentrations in the pseudostem. The results can be used to develop soil management strategies for improving banana productivity in infected plantations. © International Society for Horticultural Science. All rights reserved.

Organic banana (Musa sp.) is one of the most important export crops in Peru, especially in the Department of Piura. The cultivation of the crop is mainly affected by biotic factors, resulting in important economic losses. The aim of this research was to characterize the causal agent of banana bacteriosis disease in Piura. Bacterial isolates were extracted from rhizome and pseudostem samples of organic bananas with typical symptoms of soft rot from different banana growing areas of Piura. Sixty colonies were obtained, while 10 isolates were selected for presenting cultural and morphological characteristics similar to those of Pectobacterium (01MB, 04MB, 05MB, 06MB and 10MB) and Dickeya (02MB, 03MB, 08MB, 07MB and 09MB); different biochemical and molecular tests were conducted. The pathogenicity of the isolates was confirmed by in vitro and in vivo inoculation of rhizome pieces and pseudostems from cultivated plants. The 10 isolates were gram negative and with perimeter flagella. The biochemical tests showed that all the isolates were positive on nutrient agar medium, Mac Conkey, catalase, gelatin hydrolysis and growth at 37°C, whereas they were negative on King’s B medium, nitrate reductase and oxidase tests. Isolates 02MB, 03MB, 08MB, 07MB and 09MB also tested positive for erythromycin and indole, while isolates 01MB, 04MB, 05MB, 06MB and 10MB were positive for CVP (Crystal violet pectate). Molecular identification and phylogenetic analysis confirmed that isolates 01MB, 04MB, 05MB and 10MB corresponded to Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum; isolates 03MB and 08MB corresponded to Dickeya chrysanthemi; and 02MB and 07MB corresponded to Dickeya paradisiaca and Klebsiella variicola, respectively. It was concluded that rhizome and pseudostem wet rot of banana grown organically in Piura is caused by the bacterial complex formed by P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, D. chrysanthemi, D. paradisiaca and K. variicola.

Male and female Cosmopolites sordidus were attracted to freshly cut banana rhizome and pseudostem in a still-air olfactometer. Females responded similarly to odors from a comparatively resistant and from a susceptible cultivar of banana, when presented as either freshly cut tissue or as Porapak-trapped volatiles. Females were also attracted to rotting banana pseudostem and to volatiles collected from it. Males and females gave similar responses to host tissue in both the behavioral bioassay and to collected volatiles in EAG recordings. Weevils did not respond, either behaviorally or electrophysiologically, to a synthetic mixture of mono- and sesqiterpenes, which made up over 9% of the volatiles collected from pseudostem. © 1993 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

Banana weevil females laid on an average 2.7 eggs/week in rhizome material and 0.7 eggs/week in pseudostem material in the laboratory. At extremely high weevil population densities the egg‐laying activity declined. Under controlled field conditions 0.7 eggs/week were laid in banana suckers and 1.3 eggs/week in stumps of harvested suckers. 25% of the weevil stages found in suckers in the field were eggs of which 78% were laid in the rhizome and 22% in the pseudostem base. The majority of eggs was deposited in the crown area of the rhizome followed by the remaining surface area of the rhizome, the walls of abandoned larval tunnels in rhizome and pseudostem and the leaf sheaths. 58% of the eggs found were considered accessible to egg predators. 1993 The Netherlands Entomological Society

During examination of banana suckers in western Kenya egg predators of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus were regularly found in the pest's egg‐laying sites, viz. on the surface of the rhizome and the pseudostem base as well as inside abandoned larval tunnels. Under experimental conditions at high pest and predator densities Eutochia pulla (Erichs.) (Col., Tenebrionidae), Euborellia annulipes (Luc.) (Dermapt., Carcinophoridae) and Dactylosternum abdominale (F.) (Col., Hydrophilidae) reduced weevil multiplication in banana suckers through egg predation by 20.5 %, 28 % and 44 %, respectively. D. abdominale was similarly effective also at lower weevil and predator densities.

Plantains (Musa spp., AAB group) are an important food crop and an integral component of the farming systems in the lowland humid forest zone of West and Central Africa. A group of 24 plantain cultivars, representing the major variability in West Africa, was evaluated for nine quantitative characters. The association between growth and yield parameters in this African plantain germplasm was examined to determine if the pattern of quantitative variation in inflorescence and vegetative traits agreed with taxonomic groupings based on inflorescence type and plant size. Phenotypic correlations between these traits were calculated. Giant cultivars were taller, their pseudostem thicker, and they flowered much later than medium-sized cultivars. Giant cultivars produced more foliage, resulting in heavier bunches with more hands and fruits. Groupings that resulted following principal component analysis (PCA) supported conventional taxonomic groupings of plantains. PC A was based mainly on time to flowering, pseudostem height, and number of fruits. The last two traits, in combination with the number of hermaphrodite flowers and the persistence of the male bud, sufficed to group plantain cultivars. © 1995 The New York Botanical Garden.

The GC-MS analysis of activated charcoal trapped air-borne volatiles from eight different banana cultivars, revealed qualitative and quantitative differences in their monoterpene content. Eighteen monoterpene hydrocarbons were found in airborne volatiles from the eight cultivars. Tricyclene, α-pinene, camphene, sabinene, β-pinene, β-myrcene, α-phellandrene, limonene, ocimene and α-dimethylstyrene are the major monoterpenes which are universally found in all cultivars. The other seven monoterpenes are present in low relative amounts. The results indicate a potential for the use of the airborne volatile composition in chemosystematic identification or classification of bananas.

Musa cultivars (bananas and plantains) are important crops in the humid tropics of Africa, America and Asia. This paper reports the extent of morphological variation of the Musa germplasm maintained in the gene-bank of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in southeastern Nigeria. Qualitative and quantitative descriptors were used to evaluate AA, BB, AB, AAA, AAB, AAAA, AAAB and AABB bananas, AAA and ABB cooking bananas, AAA beer bananas and AAB plantains and a few wild species. Univariate and principal component (PCA) analyses were performed to identify the most important descriptors to characterize and classify Musa germplasm collections. The most important qualitative morphological descriptors were persistence of male bud and hermaphrodite flowers, pigmentation in pseudostem, foliage, petiole and male flower, pseudostem blotching and waxiness, and leaf orientation. Furthermore, the most important quantitative morphological descriptors included pseudostem girth, height of tallest sucker, number of fruits and fruit sizes. These quantitative descriptors have a high heritability (>0.8), high repeatibility (>2.0)and low coefficient of variation (9-15%) with the exception of the height of the tallest sucker. The implications of the germplasm grouping revealed by PCA are briefly discussed in relation to the evolution of the triploid cultivars. This paper also proposes a new scientific nomenclature for the triploid Musa cultivars.

Three varieties of enset (Ensete ventricosum), Agade, Badedat and Lemat, were collected in the Guraghe zone in Ethiopia. The plant parts (the leaf lamina, leaf midribs, pseudostem sheath, pseudostem core and corm) were separated, weighed and analysed. The dried samples were analysed for dry matter (DM), total ash, crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF) and lignin. There was no significant difference between varieties in the proportion of the DM weight of the plant parts to the total DM weight of each respective variety nor was there any difference between varieties in their chemical components except in the lignin of the pseudostem sheath where Badedat variety had a lower content of lignin, and the DM and CP of the corm where Lemat variety had lower values than the two other varieties. The average values in percent of DM for the chemical composition of leaf and pseudostem respectively were 12.6 and 7.2 (CP), 62.7 and 23.7 (NDF), 40.9 and 9.8 (ADF), 6.7 and 1.8 (lignin) and 12.6 and 7.8 (ash). The DM content was 11.7% in the leaves and 15.8% in the pseudostem. The voluntary intake of enset leaf and pseudostem with or without urea supplementation was determined using eight non-lactating Ethiopian zebu cows with an average live weight of 197.5 kg (S.D. = 12.42) in the experiment. Urea supplementation had a significant effect on DM intake of pseudostem of enset (22.0 vs. 25.6 g/kg body weight/day for unsupplemented and urea supplemented respectively) but had no significant effect on the DM intake of the leaf (24.3 vs 24.8 g/kg body weight/day for unsupplemented and urea-supplemented respectively). The rumen degradability of the plant parts (the leaf lamina, leaf midribs, pseudostem sheath, pseudostem core and corm) of three varieties of enset was studied using three fistulated steers of Ethiopian zebu breed and incubation periods of 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. The degradability of enset lamina at 48 h was better than that of straw and banana leaf and similar to that of stover and Chloris gayana hay. The other parts of the enset plant had even higher degradability than green C. gayana, setaria grass, elephant grass and guatemala grass. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Banana (Musa spp.) is a major semi-perennial fruit crop in Sri Lanka. A study was conducted at the Regional Agricultural Research and Development Centre, Angunakolapelessa to investigate the effect of age on growth and yield of banana cv Mysore ("Embul", AAB group). Thirty-seven "Embul" banana accessions collected from various ecological regions of Sri Lanka were studied in a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replicates. The observations were recorded in three consecutive years. Number of leaves per clump, LAI (leaf area index) and penetration of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to the crop were recorded at 4, 9, 20 and 32 months after planting. Pseudostem height and girth of the crop were investigated at different ages. Number of combs and fruits per comb, fruit maturity period, bunch weight, total fruit weight, average fruit weight and peduncle weight were also measured. Comb weight, fruit circumference, fruit length and diameter were recorded in the second and last combs. Leaf number and LAI increased, while penetration of PAR decreased with the age. Except weight of second comb, fruit length in second comb and fruit diameter in last comb, all other characteristics varied significantly with age of the crop. Fruit maturity period increased with the age of the crop to second year and then decreased, while total fruit weight decreased up to second year and then increased. Number of fruits per comb and bunch weight significantly increased after the second year. Stem height and girth, number of fruits per bunch, weight of the peduncle and length of the male axis consistently increased with the age of the crop investigated up to the third year.

The influence of windbreak shading was investigated over the plant crop (P) and first ratoon (R1) cycle of bananas cv. Dwarf Cavendish, to quantify its effects on assimilation, phenology and yield in the subtropics. Plants growing under seasonal windbreak shading (late autumn to early spring) were compared with those growing under full sun but under similar windbreak protection. Windbreak shading reduced average photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) by 69%, which in turn reduced photosynthesis rate by 27%, transpiration rate by 38% and stomatal conductance by 40% compared with plants growing in full sun. Pseudostem temperature was 2.1 K lower on plants growing in shade. This led to a reduction in monthly leaf emergence rate and an extended cycle time. An additional extension to cycle time was caused by the extra 3.4 leaves produced before flowering on plants growing under windbreak shading. The decreased photosynthesis of leaves growing in shade was partially compensated for in the P cycle by an extended flowering to harvest interval, resulting in no loss of bunch mass. However, bunch mass was significantly reduced in the R1 cycle, when flower to harvest intervals were similar. The most significant effect of windbreak shading was therefore a cumulative 10.6% extension in cycle time over the two crop cycles. The effect of a longer cycle and reduced bunch mass in the R1, caused by windbreak shading, resulted in an overall reduction of 13% in annual yield per ha, compared with plants growing in full sun.

Two bean (Phaseollus vulgaris L.) cultivars, Arroyo Loro and DOR 364, and four lines, 9443-1, 9443-8, 9443-33, 9226-17, were intercropped once or twice with one cycle of plantain cultivar Maricongo at the AES-UPR Corozal substation during 1994-1995. The first cycle of beans intercropped at the time of plantain planting produced a high yield. The second cycle of beans intercropped two months before the termination of plantain harvest yielded poorly. The height of intercropped plantain plants was less than that of non-intercropped plantain plants (P < 0.05) at six months after planting. However, at 12 months, there was no height difference between them. There was no significant difference in diameter of pseudostem, nor in number of leaves, between the intercropped and the non-intercropped plantain plants. Plantain yields, in terms of number of fruits and bunch weight, were not significantly affected by the intercropping (P < 0.05). The highest net income of the intercropping treatment was derived from the first cycle of the bean line 9443-1 ($7,646/ha). This net income represents an additional income of $4,894/ha beyond that of plantain monoculture.

Plantains exhibit great variability in West and Central Africa, which accounts for 60% of world production. Sixteen quantitative characteristics were evaluated in 75 plantain and 18 banana cultivars during several production cycles. The extent of variation in quantitative continuous characteristics and the phenotypic correlations between them were analysed. Index descriptors based on the combination of two characteristics were calculated. Despite the significant (P &lt; 0.05) influence of the environment and the genotype-by-environment interaction, most of the variation was significantly affected by the specific genotype of the Musa accessions. The most productive cultivars were the Cavendish bananas and the giant French plantains (&gt; 30 t ha-1 year-1). Five phenotypic correlations were common to all known taxonomic Musa groups. Short-cycling cultivars showed early flowering, whereas tall cultivars had wide plant girth and many leaves. The number of fruit per bunch was significantly associated with the number of hands (or nodal clusters of fruit). The most important component of yield potential was bunch weight in all Musa cultivars, and days to harvest only in the dessert bananas derived from interspecific crosses of M. acuminata. Index descriptors may be useful for selection of traits that are difficult to score or that show a high coefficient of variation. Short Musa cultivars may be selected by calculating the index of pseudostem condensation. A low value of pseudostem condensation (&lt; 9 cm leaf-1) was characteristic of known dwarf plantain and banana cultivars.

A dwarf variant (TC1-229) of banana resistant to race 4 of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense was identified from a tall, resistant Cavendish cultivar, 'Tai Chiao No. 1'. This study showed that the dwarf characteristic of TC1-229 was retained over 4 clonal generations. Although 3% of tissue-cultured plants of TC1-229 were found to be a tall reversion, the dwarf characteristic of TC1-229 appears to be a relatively stable genetic trait. The average pseudostem height of TC1-229 in the plant crop was 229 cm which was about 62 cm shorter than its source plant. TC1-229 retained the resistance to fusarium wilt in a wide range of environments. Unlike Dwarf Cavendish, the leaf bases of TC1-229 were not crowded and the bunch stalk was normal, thus 'choking' was not observed. This study shows that the step-wise selection of beneficial traits by using somaclonal variation can be useful in banana improvement.

Disease severity associated with the pathogen Fusarium oxysporum is generally thought to be proportional to the population of fungal propagules in the soil. However, results from studies using naturally infested soil are contradictory, implicating host predisposition to disease. In this study, soil was amended with chicken manure to investigate the interdependence between the activity and invasiveness of the pathogen, and the incidence of Panama disease in susceptible banana plantlets. Two soil types naturally infested with either race 1 or race 4 of the pathogen, and cultivars Lady finger and Grande Naine, were used. Pathogen activity was measured by burying root tip segments for 5 days, then calculating the frequency of isolation of Fusarium from the segments. Pathogen invasion was measured by transplanting banana plantlets into trays of amended and unamended soil for 4 weeks, then calculating the frequency of recovery of Fusarium from each pseudostem. Amending both soil types with chicken manure enhanced both pathogen invasion and disease incidence. However, pathogen activity was not correlated with either parameter. We postulate that the addition of chicken manure is predisposing banana plantlets to Panama disease, by reducing the efficacy of the host wound response.

The effects of host and non-host plant odours on the foraging responses of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), were investigated in the laboratory through arena and olfactometer bioassays. Contrary to previous reports that banana rhizome and pseudostem were the most attractive parts to the weevil, dead leaves were most preferred. Comparison of dead banana leaves with dead leaves of other plants showed that attractant odours were present in yam, cocoyam and dead grasses but absent in cocoa and soybean leaves. Complete leaf senescence while the leaf was attached to the mother plant proved necessary for the development of the dead-leaf-based odours but the involvement of microbial organisms could not be demonstrated. It is possible that dead-leaf-based attractants could be used in combination with microbials such as entomogenous fungi and nematodes in integrated management of C. sordidus.

Scientific strategies for crop improvement ensue from genetic knowledge gain from the relevant breeding populations. Few genetic studies were undertaken in Musa before the 1990s, despite the importance of the crop in human diet in the tropics. It was believed that genetic studies of most cultivated Musa, a virtually sterile triploid crop, were impossible. This explains the absence, until recently, of inheritance studies in triploid plantain and banana and the lack of genetic markers. Although several characteristics of the Musa crop make genetic analysis difficult, the production of euploid test-cross segregating populations obtained from triploid-diploid crosses has made inheritance studies possible. Thus, plantain and banana genomes have been investigated at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) since 1992. This paper provides insight into the genetics of black sigatoka and banana weevil resistance, pseudostem waxiness, virus susceptibility, apical dominance and suckering behavior, dwarfism, bunch orientation, fruit parthenocarpy, and male fertility. It also discusses the effects of genetic markers, ploidy and the environment on quantitative variation of disease and pest resistance as well as growth parameters of yield. This new knowledge has provided important information to develop IITA's scientific breeding strategy for the genetic improvement of plantain and banana.

The movement and mobilisation of phosphorus in various tissues of banana was studied using 32P. The isotope was given by pseudostem injection and activity measured in various tissues. It was inferred that the male inflorescence, rhizome, fruit and fruit peduncle are the major nutrient sinks. The activity pattern in different hands showed that the highest activity was in the fourth followed by the third, second and fifth (terminal) and least in the first hand (first to emerge) in a five hand system. Another experiment conducted on various intensities of bunch trimming in a eight hand system revealed that trimming of three terminal hands improved yield and finger characters like length, girth and weight. The trimmed hands could be used as a vegetable and the retained hands for yielding quality fruits. Thus the same bunch serves the dual purpose of vegetable and fruit. The study underlines the imperative need for removing the male bud, fruit peduncle and undeveloped hands.

The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development. Host plant resistance offers another promising avenue of control. Numerous resistant clones are known, including Yangambi-km 5, Calcutta 4, and Pisang awak. Resistance is most often through antibiosis resulting in egg or larval failure. Banana breeding is a slow and difficult process. Current research is exploring genetic improvement through biotechnology techniques including the introduction of foreign genes. Neem has also shown potential for control of banana weevil. Studies on the use of other botanicals against banana weevil have failed to produce positive results. Chemical control of banana weevil remains a common and effective method for larger scale producers but is beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers. However, the weevil has displayed the ability to develop resistance against a broad range of chemicals. In summary, cultural control remains the most available approach for resource-poor farmers. A combination of several cultural methods is likely to reduce weevil pressure. Among the methods currently under study, microbial control, host plant resistance and neem appear to offer the most promise.

To compare the mineral nutrition of organically and normally grown banana plants, observations were made on growth and yield of organic banana plants, at the Canary Islands. The data were then discussed opposite the results previously reported for conventional plantations. Materials and methods. Growth parameters (plant height, leaf emission rate, pseudostem circumference) and yield parameters (bunch weight, number of hands, finger grade, etc.) were measured during ten months on an organically grown banana plantation of Dwarf Cavendish cv. Leaf N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn contents were also assessed. Results and discussion. Leaf emission rates showed higher values in late spring and early summer (0.099-0.109 leaf.d-1), while pseudostem circumference grew more in late spring (0.238 cm.d-1) than in summer. In August, pseudostem circumference decreased dramatically, probably because the plants with a larger circumference had flowered before that month and could not be measured. Bunches gave good yields for the zone (43.59 kg on average) and had a high mean number of hands (12.79). Number of fingers of the second upper hand (25.63), their grade (37.63 cm), length (23.50 cm) and weight (165.19 g) ranged from normal to high. Month of harvesting influenced yield and quality of the fruits. Leaf content of N, P, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn fell within the normal range related to the conventionally grown banana plants. Potassium foliar content showed low levels but not deficiencies, whereas Ca leaf concentrations were high but not excessive. No relationship was found among leaf nutrient levels and growth, yield and fruit quality parameters. © 2001 Cirad/EDP Sciences.

An experiment was established to characterize twenty-seven locally selected and introduced plantain clones. The clones were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Twenty morphological descriptors were used to obtain information of the plant, bunch and individual fruits at bunch-emergence and at harvest. The clones were first organized into two main groups on the basis of their genomic constitution: true plantain (Musa AAB) and cooking banana (Musa ABB, AAAB). Within the second group, we included three Musa AAB clones that are considered distinctive cooking bananas because the M. acuminata species responsible for the donation of the A genome had its origin in the Pacific and not in Asia. In each main group the clones were subdivided into true-horn, false-horn and French on the basis of bunch phenotype. Clones in these three subgroups were further subdivided into tall and dwarf, depending on the height of the pseudostem. After the clones were organized into this classification, statistical comparisons were made between or among those corresponding to the same subdivision, utilizing the data obtained from the plant, bunch and individual fruit traits. This scheme is easy to implement in the field, provides for the clustering and separation of clones regardless of their geographical origin and common names, and offers the opportunity for agronomists and horticulturists to learn about the economic potential of the clones from the outset. The application of this scheme will allow the number of plantain accessions in the TARS collection to be reduced from 27 to 20 clones.

Despite extensive research since pathogenicity was first established in 1919, no cultural or chemical control strategy has proven effective against Fusarium wilt of bananas. The efficacy of cultural control is attributed to the suppression of pathogen activity. Yet, amending naturally infested soil with aged chicken manure has been shown to enhance disease severity, without any change in the activity of the pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) in the soil. In this study, the effect of amending soil with composted sawdust, and of solarising soil, was compared with the effect of amending soil with chicken manure. Bioassays comparing the activity of Foc in the soil with the extent of invasion of banana pseudostem tissue by Foc were used to investigate why strategies targetting pathogen survival have not proven successful in controlling this disease. The enhancement of Foc invasion of the banana plantlets was reproduced with the addition of chicken manure to the naturally infested soil. However, changes in the activity of Foc in the soil were not associated with changes in the frequency of invasion of the plantlets. Invasion of banana pseudostems in the sawdust and solarisation treatments was not significantly different from invasion in the respective control treatments, despite a reduction in the activity of Foc in the sawdust-amended soil and an enhancement in the solarised soil. Moreover, the increase in Foc activity in the solarised soil recorded during the bioassays occurred despite the effectiveness of solarisation in reducing the survival of Foc in pre-colonised banana root tips buried in the soil. Changes in the frequency of invasion were associated with changes in the availability of mineral nitrogen, particularly ammonium N. These results suggest that the physiological response of banana cultivars to ammonium N may be associated with their susceptibility to Fusarium wilt. Accordingly, cultural strategies for controlling Panama disease will only be effective if they enhance the ability of the host to resist invasion.

Sterility has profound effects on the development of reproductive tissues in members of the Musaceae and limits genetic improvement required to deal with new diseases. Ovules of seeded diploid Musa acuminata (AA) and edible triploids (AAA) from the same cytogenetic group, plus edible triploids containing genomes of the M. balbisiana cytogenetic group (AAB, ABB) and the related genus Ensete sp. were studied to determine the effects of sterility on the growth and development of the ovule and its tissues. Specimens were collected from subtropical and Mediterranean environments in Australia. At anthesis, the ovules of triploid plants were 36% larger than the ovules of diploid plants. The diploid ovules ceased growth shortly after the inflorescence emerged from the pseudostem. In contrast, the triploid ovules continued to grow 7-10 days past anthesis, increasing in size by 70%. All ovules of diploid M. acuminata ssp. had an embryo sac at anthesis, against 97% for triploids. At anthesis the embryo sacs in diploid ovules occupied 2.7% of the nucellus compared with 1.5% in triploid ovules. The embryo sacs did not grow between bunch emergence and anthesis, once formed they maintained the same size. Many embryo sacs were not positioned correctly, flush with the nucellar cap. The diploid M. acuminata ssp. had 75% of embryo sacs correctly positioned against 10% in the edible triploids. The proportion of balbisiana genome (B) did not affect ovule or nucellus size or shape, or cell number across the nucellus. It increased the embryo sac presence 96-100% of ovules. The sterile edible triploid bananas have embryo sacs at anthesis but many are incorrectly positioned, which may contribute to their sterility. The balbisiana genome in the edible triploids was associated with a 2.4-fold increase in the number of correctly positioned embryo sacs and this may contribute to the increased fertility associated with the B genome. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of weed management on banana (Musa AAA cv. Grande Naine) parasitic nematodes was evaluated under Costa Rican field conditions with special reference to their spatial distribution and the damage caused to roots of different thickness classes and their relation to yield losses. Root samples were taken at plant harvest, from soil blocks at 0-30,30-60 and 60-90 cm from the pseudostem, and at every 15 cm depth, from 0 to 120 cm. Weed management neither affected the nematode numbers nor their horizontal and vertical distribution and associated root damage. Differences in Radopholus similis (P<0.0001), Helicotylenchus spp. (P=0.0115) and total nematode populations (P<0.0001) were found in roots of different thickness. The average populations in thick, thin and fine roots were for R. similis 270,666 (57%), 120,401 (25%) and 11,313 (2%); for Helicotylenchus spp. 36,094 (7%), 22,508 (5%) and 8,824 (2%); and total nematodes 390,425 (65%), 145,534 (31%) and 21,177 (4%), respectively. No linear correlations were found between bunch weight and the number and density of nematodes or with their damage. Even though, no statistical difference was found in bunch weight, the manual weed control plot yielded 1.4 kg heavier bunches, which might have important implications for sustainable agriculture. The implementation of weed control by hand chopping may improve the physical, chemical and biological soil properties and reduce soil erosion, temperature fluctuations, evaporation rate, and nutrient leaching, and increase water infiltration. As a consequence of the decrease in herbicide applications, soil and air pollution might be reduced. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ten plantain (Musa x paradisiaca L.) varieties were evaluated at the experimental farm of the Institute, Lucknow to find out the suitable varieties for commercial cultivation. The highest pseudostem girth was recorded in 'Burdi Chinia' followed by 'Bhos', 'Chinia', 'Kothia' and 'Bersain'. The pseudostem height was maximum in 'Chinia' and 'Bhos' and minimum in 'Dakhnisagar' and 'No 15. 'Bhos' and 'Gauria' took maximum days (456 days) for a crop cycle and 'Dakhnisagar' (375) and 'Chinia' (383) minimum days. Bunch weight and estimated yield/ha were maximum in 'Chakkel', followed by 'Bersain', 'Bhos', 'Chinia', 'Gauria' and 'Kothia'. Minimum bunch weight, estimated yield/ ha and hand weight were recorded in Dakhnisagar. Finger length was maximum (20.9 cm) in 'Beula'. The finger diameter (5.6 mm) and weight (218.7g) were higher in 'Bhos' than the other varieties. On the basis of bunch weight/plant, estimated yield/ha and short crop cycle, varieties 'Chakkel', 'Chinia', 'Bersain', 'Kothia', respectively, were found suitable for commercial cultivation in subtropics of north India.

Plantain production (Musa spp.) in Central and South America and the Caribbean is affected by bacterial diseases. In Puerto Rico, production of the plantain 'Hua Moa' is affected by a condition known as bunch abortion or 'choke neck'. This condition in some cases is accompanied by soft rot symptoms and therefore could be related to phytopathogenic bacteria. The purpose of this study was to identify the bacteria related to the soft rot tissues on plants affected with the bunch abortion symptoms and determine their virulence in other clones of plantain and banana. Bacterial colonies were isolated from pseudostems of Hua Moa at three locations in Puerto Rico, using semi-selective and nutritive agar media. The pathogenicity was determined by using potato and plantain pseudostem discs in humid chambers under in vitro conditions. Pathogenic bacteria were identified by using the BIOLOG® system. Under greenhouse conditions, the virulence of Burkholderia gladioli, Pseudomonas spinosa, Erwinia chrysanthemi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was confirmed on plantain (Maricongo, FIAH-121, Enano Común, and Hua Moa) and banana (Grand Nain) using a scale from 1 to 9. All clones evaluated under greenhouse conditions were susceptible to E. chrysanthemi, potential causal agent of soft rot in Hua Moa plantain once the bunch abortion appears. Burkholderia gladioli is reported for the first time affecting plantain and banana.This bacterium was more virulent in Hua Moa and Grand Nain clones with severity of 7 and 5, respectively, than in Maricongo, severity 3. Pseudomonas spinosa and P. aeruginosa produced less damage with severity less than 4, than E. chrysanthemi and B. gladioli with severity greater than 4. This research was conducted under in vitro and greenhouse conditions and demonstrates that the most important bacteria causing soft rot in plants with the choke neck condition are E. chrysanthemi and B. gladioli. It is recommended to conduct field studies using plants up to the reproductive stage to determine whether these bacteria are also related as causal agents of the choke neck.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlations between vegetative and productive characteristics of banana tree (Musa spp) cv Prata-Anã (genomic group AAB) differently managed from the conventional system. The experiment was carried out in an orchard with five years old banana plants spaced by 3,5 x 2,0 m, in the Fazendas Reunidas FFL Ltda., at Cristais Paulista, São Paulo, Brazil. The experiment was a split plot under a completely randomized design with three replicates, being the main treatments constituted by: M1 - daughter-plant without the mother-plant whose stem was cut after flowering; M2 - daughter-plant and mother- plant conventionally managed until harvest. The sub plots were constituted by twelve periods of selection of the daughter-plants (February 2002 to January 2003). The pseudostem diameter and the bunch weight of all plants and the vegetative period of the daughter-plants were evaluated. The statistical analysis showed a positive correlation between the stem diameter of the daughter-plants and mother-plants. The stem diameter of the mother-plant was positive correlated with its bunch weight. However the stem diameter of the daughter-plant not was correlated with its bunch weight. The vegetative cycle and the pseudostem diameter of the daughter-plants were negatively correlated. The Plant management (M1 and M2) and the selection of periods daughter-plant did not affected the correlations evaluated in this study.

The banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus, is the most important insect pest of banana and plantain in the world. Cultural control methods were investigated over 2 years in southern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Harvesting at ground level and dissection of remnants (treatment 1), and covering the base of the mat (entire plant consisting of several meristems) with soil and moving debris to the inter-row (treatment 2), were compared to a positive control that involved treatment of plants with a registered pesticide (treatment 3), and a negative control that involved harvesting at 150 cm from the collar with no soil or sanitation amendments (treatment 4). Yield, weevil damage and pseudostem girth of plants were measured from August to November annually, while adult beetle densities were assessed over 4 weeks in October/November and April. Nematode samples were taken and analysed in October/November every year. Damage parameters included the coefficient of infestation, the percentage coefficient of infestation (PCI) at two intervals, the summed PCI value, the percentage cross-sectional damage of the central cylinder and cortex, and the mean cross-sectional damage percentage. A randomized block design with three replicates was used in the trial. The parameters were similar before the onset of the trial. Fruit yield and plant girth, corrected by nematode densities, were not significantly different in any treatment, nor were the nematodes controlled. Soil cover and recession of remnants was the only effective treatment, significantly reducing the CI, but not the adult density or the other damage parameters. Soil cover showed promise as a cultural control method because it only needs to be applied seasonally and reduced the percentage cross-sectional damage of the central cylinder, the damage parameter most closely related to yield, by 14%. © 2008 The Authors.

World production of bananas, estimated at 106 million tons (Lescot 2006), ranks fourth in agricultural production. Bananas make up the largest production of fruits and the largest international trade, more than apple, orange, grape and melon. Bananas are cultivated in more than 120 countries in tropical and subtropical zones on 5 continents. Banana products represent an essential food resource and have an important socioeconomic and ecological role. Current varieties are generally seedless triploid clones either of the single genome A from the species Musa acuminata (group AAA) or of both genomes A and B from species M. acuminata and Musa balbisiana (groups AAB and ABB). More rarely, diploid varieties (AA and AB) and tetraploid clones are encountered. There are two major channels of banana production: those cultivated for export and those reserved for local markets. The main banana varieties cultivated for export, known as Grande Naine, Poyo and Williams, belong to the monospecific triploid bananas (AAA) of the Cavendish sub-group. They differ from each other only in somatic mutations such as plant height or bunch and fruit shape. Their production relies on an intensive monoculture of the agro-industrial type, without rotation, and a high quantity of inputs. Banana cultivation for local consumption is based on a large number of varieties adapted to different conditions of production as well as the varied uses and tastes of consumers. Diploid bananas, close to the ancestral wild forms, are still cultivated in Southeast Asia. In other regions, triploid clones belonging to different sub-groups Plantain, Silk, Lujugira, Gros Michel, Pisang Awak are the most widely distributed. Bananas have many uses. They are not only consumed as fresh fruits but also cooked, like plantains. They are processed in various ways, into chips, fries, fritters, purees, jams, ketchup and alcohol (banana wine and beer have a very significant production in East Africa). The daily per capita consumption of bananas from 30 g to over 500 g in some East African countries. Apart from the fruit, other parts of the plant are also used: the pseudostem is used for its fibres and as floaters (Musa textilis or abacá) in the Philippines, and the leaves are used to make shelters or roofs or as wraps for cooking. In Thailand, the floral buds of particular varieties (Pisang Awak) are used in various culinary preparations. Some varieties are also considered to have medicinal properties. Cultivated throughout the world, bananas are threatened by several diseases and pests (Stover and Simmonds 1987; Jones 1999) that need to be taken into account for banana improvement. Various major fungal diseases are constraints in industrial production and, to a lesser degree, in local production. For example, Sigatoka disease (SD) due to Mycosphaerella musicola and black leaf streak disease (BLSD) caused by M. fijiensis result in production losses in large industrial plantations and necessitate costly pest control measures to be adopted. In certain production zones, Fusarium wilt due to the soil fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense prevents the cultivation of susceptible varieties like the Gros Michel types. Great constraints are also exerted by the nematodes Radopholus similis and several representatives of the genus pratylenchus and by the black weevil of banana, Cosmopolites sordidus. Also, viral diseases are spreading. Those of greatest concern are due to BBTV (banana bunchy top virus), CMV (cucumber mosaic virus), BSV (banana streak virus) and BBMV (banana bract mosaic virus). Chemical control measures used in intensive cultivation are not available to small banana farmers in developing countries. Furthermore, for some diseases, there is no effective chemical control. Genetic improvement has thus been focused mainly on obtaining varieties resistant to principal pests and diseases. Breeding bananas through hybridisation, which began in the 1920s, is currently being pursued at seven research centres. FHIA in Honduras is breeding banana for export as well as the cooking types (Rowe 1984). EMBRAPA-CNPMF in Brazil (Dantas et al. 1993), NRCB and TNAU in India (Sathiamoorthy et al. 2000; Krishnamoorthy and Kumar 2004) aim at breeding local types of dessert and cooking bananas. CARBAP (Jenny et al. 2003) in Cameroon and IITA (Tenkouano and Swennen 2004) in Nigeria are conducting research on plantain and banana breeding in Africa. These six research centres are mainly interested in developing new tetraploid varieties by crossing triploid varieties and wild or improved diploid clones with resistance to diseases. Some secondary triploids derived from crosses between these new tetraploid varieties and other diploid clones were also obtained. In the French West Indies, CIRAD has conceived another crossing strategy aimed at the development of triploid varieties directly from diploid plant material (Bakry et al. 2001). Since the 1980s, apart from these conventional breeding approaches, other groups have focused on mutagenesis as at IAEA (Roux 2004) in Austria or on the selection of somaclonal variants as at TBRI (Hwang and Ko 1990) in Taiwan. These technologies appeared as a result of the development of in vitro culture techniques designed for rapid industrial multiplication of micro-propagated banana plants. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

The results of research on the water relations and irrigation need of banana are collated and summarised in an attempt to link fundamental studies on crop physiology to irrigation practices. Background information on the ecology of the banana and crop development processes, with emphasis on root growth and water uptake, is presented, followed by reviews of the influence of water stress on gas exchange (stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration), crop water use, and yield. Emphasis is placed on research that has international relevance and, where appropriate, three geographical areas (the tropics, subtropics and Mediterranean climates) are considered. Although roots can extend to depths of 1.0-1.5 m, the effective depth of rooting is usually taken to be 0-0.40 m, sometimes extending to 0.60 m. Stomatal conductance is a sensitive measure of soil water availability and plant water status, whilst transpiration rates can be limited by dry air (saturation deficits &gt;2.0 kPa). In the subtropics, there are seasonal differences in the crop coefficient (Kc) with values ranging from 0.6 in the winter months to about 1.0 Epan in the summer. It is difficult to draw generic conclusions with wide applicability from the irrigation experiments as they were reported. All the components of marketable yield can be enhanced by irrigation whilst applying insufficient water delays crop development. Annual yield responses to irrigation are variable, but water use efficiencies of 40 kg ha-1 mm-1 (fresh fruit/water applied) have been achieved in the tropics and subtropics (and elsewhere up to 80 kg ha-1 mm-1 with partial replacement of the soil water deficit). To ensure large yields of (marketable) fruit, soil water deficits must be kept low (Ψm &gt;-20 kPa at 0.2 m depth). In the subtropics, this means irrigation intervals should not exceed 2-3 d during the summer. The cooling effect of irrigation with micro-sprinklers on the soil and pseudostem temperatures, compared with drippers, can delay crop development and reduce annual yields by 30%. There is some (limited) evidence that the presence of the B genome contributes to drought tolerance. Yield response factors to irrigation for different growth stages have yet to be confirmed. Opportunities to improve the water productivity of the many, diverse banana cultivars need to be explored further. © Cambridge University Press 2009.

The banana tree demands large quantities of fertilizers to maintain its nutritional requirements and achieve high productivity, but large percentage applied are not available, since it gets lost mainly by fixation, leaching and volatilization. The objective of this study was to evaluate the rate of remobilization and repartition of nutrients in banana tree, cultivar Thap Maeo, cultivated in the Western Amazon. The results showed that the highest proportion of K, Na, Mg, S, B, Cu, Fe and Zn was found in the pseudostem. The remaining flowers represent a strong drain of nutrients. The biomass that comes from the culture residues represents a significant source of nutrients. The nutrient remobilization index was higher with N and K. The inverse was observed with Fe and Mn.

Purpose of review: This article reviews some of the versatile postharvest uses of plantains and other components of plantain plants. Findings: Plantain belongs to the Musacace family and is cultivated in over 120 countries. Many African, Asian and Latin American countries depend primarily on the plantain plant for sustainability. Mature plantains are consumed as a staple on cooking, while overripe fruit is consumed in raw form. Plantains are rich in iron, potassium, ascorbic acid and vitamin A, and are a very good source of starch, which has various uses, such as in functional foods and edible films. In addition to plantains being used for food, the waste material such as the peel, pseudo-stem, pith, male bud and leaves, have also been used as food and feed, as well as for other special purposes in most of the plantain-growing parts of the world. Directions for future research: A plantain-based diet can be designed for diabetic people based on its low glycaemic index. Moreover, due to its high starch content and cheaper cost, it has the potential to be added to other fruit-based juices and beverages as starch filler. Further research can be done on deflavouring of plantain, which might overwhelm other fruit based beverages when added as a filler. Since most of the parts of the plantain plant have some or other therapeutic value, further research can be done to extract the phytochemicals for potential drug development.

Field performance of two IITA plantain hybrids ('PITA-1', 'PITA-4') were assessed at two locations in Ghana alongside two local landraces (False Horn 'Brodeyuo', Intermediate French 'Oniaba') and a hybrid cultivar 'Apem Hemaa' ('FHIA-21'). The objective of the study was to identify high yielding and disease resistant hybrids for growers in Ghana. The hybrids were evaluated for their agronomic performance and yield, tolerance to Black Sigatoka disease, number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest, crop cycle, plant height and pseudostem girth. The results showed that the hybrids were tolerant/resistant to the Black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) disease with high number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest. This characteristic of the hybrids was an important feature that could fit well into the smallholder cropping system. The crop cycles were comparable to that of 'False Horn' plantains. The yield performance of the hybrids was better compared to the landraces. The number of hands per bunch produced by the hybrids was also higher than those of the landraces except the intermediate French plantain ('Oniaba'). The finger lengths of the IITA hybrids were however shorter compared to the landraces and this could hinder their acceptance by consumers.

The aim of this research emerged to evaluate the content of N, P, K in flours from different parts of edible Musa clones. For this experiment, a randomized block design with four replicates was established by using five Musa clones ('FHIA 01', 'FHIA 02', 'FHIA 03', 'Yangambi Km5' y 'Plátano Hartón' and 36 plants per plot. Pseudostem, leaf, shell, fruit pulp, acorn, and rachis of the bunch were ground to fine flour; and a chemical analysis of N, P, K nutrients was performed. Statistical analysis of data in a factorial arrangement was used. A highly significant difference for N, P, K contents was found, resulting in higher content of N from 'FHIA 03́ leaf flour (2.57%), P from 'FHIA 03' and 'Yagambi Km 5' acorn flour (0.37 and 0.34% respectively); and K from 'Plátano Hartón' rachis flour (2.32%). As conclusion, these Musaceae vegetative parts represent a potential in flour preparation as raw material for making animal feed with acceptable N P K content, giving an integral advantage for crop and plant parts which can be used by the producers. Digestibility studies in animals and food rations for economic feasibility are recommended.

This chapter describes the morphology of the musa plant and discusses the potential benefits of morphological diversity. The East African Highland bananas, also considered as the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, display a very variable pseudostem color, the intensity of which varies with environmental conditions. Thus, in the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, the pseudostem and leaf petioles tend to get darker as altitude increases. Leaf pigmentation and posture may affect photosynthetic efficiency and transpiration rates as described by Brun and Turner, but there are surprisingly not many recent studies relating leaf morphology to photosynthetic efficiency or transpiration of the existing cultivars. Continued elongation of the main stalk of the inflorescence causes the bunch to hang over, the bracts open and fall, disclosing the female flower clusters or hands. The female flowers undergo further development without being pollinated or fertilized. A comprehensive study of the root system of a wider gene pool is required to construct an ideotype target for genetic improvement of plantains and bananas. © 2011 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Banana cultivars have been classified into genome groups based on their morphological characters. Modern molecular tools are available to support characterisation, identification of hybridisation and analysis of evolutionary trends. Two wild species, Musa acuminata ssp. burmannicoides 'Cacutta-4' (female parent) and Musa balbisiana 'Bee Hee Kela' (male parent) collected from Northeastern Hilly region of India, were crossed to produce F1 populations of the AB type with characters from the heterozygous parents. Seed set was very high (3552 seeds) and 317 seedlings germinated. About 150 seedlings were maintained for further evaluation and molecular mapping. Plant height was dwarf to medium, similar to 'Calcutta-4'. The pseudostem was green with few black-brown blotches, expressing both characters, but less waxy, which is characteristic of the 'A' genome. For the 52 hybrids that flowered, most bunches were horizontal, showing the AB character. However, there was good segregation for male flower colour. The colour varied from cream to pink-purple with gradations of pink (31% of the observed progeny). It was observed that 40% of the F1 population studied did not produce any pollen and was totally sterile, unlike the parent accessions. These F1 populations could serve as useful material for studying segregation of different morphological characters and molecular mapping.

The objective of this study was to examine the molecular and phenotypic variability of 'Prata Anã' banana clones cultivated in northern Minas Gerais State. For the phenotypic and molecular characterization, the clones were collected from five properties. The morphological characterization of 20 clones was accomplished through a qualitative evaluation of 74 descriptors. For the molecular evaluations, 45 clones were collected, and 14 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA primers were used. Among the 74 morphological descriptors evaluated in the 20 'Prata Anã' banana tree clones, 53 descriptors presented in the same homogeneous class for all clones. The presence of anthocyanin in the pseudostem (ANT) and the shape (BUS) and flexion (FLX) of the bunch clearly differentiated the 'Prata Anã' banana clones from the commercial cultivar. A total of 176 bands were produced from the molecular analysis using the 14 RAPD primers; there were 116 monomorphic and 60 polymorphic bands, with an average polymorphism percentage of 52.2%. The amplification using the OPP 14 primer resulted in the greatest percentage of polymorphic bands at 88%. The dendrogram indicated that each of the 45 'Prata Anã' clones that were evaluated using RAPD markers clustered with the commercial 'Prata Anã' cultivar.

The present study was conducted in two successive seasons (2009/2010 and 2010/2011) on the first and second ratoons of Williams banana plants cultivated in loamy clay soil under flood irrigation at a private orchard located at Tanta, Gharbia Governorate, Egypt. Four planting densities (ranged from 933 to 1400 plants feddan-1) were examined to study their effect on vegetative growth, flowering, yield and fruit quality of Williams banana. Banana plants grown at close spacing had taller pseudostem than plants grown under wide spacing. The highest yield per feddan was obtained from plants spaced at 3×2 in with two plants per hole, followed by those at 3×1 in, with one plant per hole since it was 34.07 and 30.33 tons in the first ratoon and 34.80 and 31.50 in the second ratoon for both planting distances, respectively. Earliest bunch shooting and minimum days for harvesting were recorded with planting distance 3×4 in with three plants per hole and bunch emerged earlier (12-13 days) than bunches produced from plants spaced at 3×1 in with one plants per hole in both first and second ratoons, respectively. Heaviest bunches were harvested from plants at 3×4 in spacing with three plants per hole. Increasing yield per feddan by this planting distance could be attributed mainly to the increasing number of plants in the area unit. The highest finger weight, length, Total Soluble Solids (TSS%) and total sugars% were produced from plant spaced at 3×4 in with three plants per hole. © 2012 Academic Journals Inc.

Occurrence of multiple male buds in banana is a rare phenomenon. It is caused by branching of the peduncle or differentiation of the male flower into male bud. Five types of peduncle branching occur, viz.: (i) inside the pseudostem, (ii) at the time the peduncle emerges from the pseudostem, (iii) after the peduncle emerges from the pseudostem but before fruit development, (iv) during fruit development, and (v) after fruit development. Mostly, branching is accidental, except for that produced by 'Double Mahoi' cultivar that always produces two or three bunches per pseudostem, which is inherited. Differentiation of male flower into male bud in banana is the world's first reported case. It has been found in four accessions of probably the same clone of Musa acuminata subsp. siamea cultivated by the Hmong hill-tribe villagers living on the highlands in northern Thailand as an idol of worship to obtain prolific babies as well as to obtain more male buds as food for nursing mother. After a brief female phase with almost no fruit developed, numerous male flowers, instead of withering and dropping, differentiate into male buds with long rachilla. Close to a hundred small male buds may be produced on a single pseudostem, thus the name 'Kluai Roi Pli' (banana having hundred male buds) has been given to this clone of banana. A single, normal-sized terminal male bud continues to produce male flowers, which may or may not differentiate into male buds. The values of multiple male buds are: (1) to satisfy curiosity, (2) as educational material, (3) as an idol for worship, (4) as ornamental plant, and (5) economic gain of increasing overall yield, number of fruits and male buds, and size and length of fruits.

There were significant differences on growth parameters as influenced by different treatments. The plant under drip irrigation with 0.75EpR and fertigation with 100% recommended dose of N& K through drip showed a strong influence on plant morphology in terms of pseudostem height, girth, number of leaves, leaf area, leaf area index, flowering and crop duration whereas lowest phyllochron and highest total number of leaves were recorded under drip irrigation with 1.00 EpR and fertigation with 100 % recommended dose of N&K through drip. © EM International.

Absorption of applied 32P by the treated as well as neighbouring banana cv. Robusta plants under high density planting was studied on a sandy clay loam soil using 32P labelled super phosphate with application of three levels of P fertilizers viz., 60, 80, and 100 per cent at 15-35, 35-55 and 55-75 cm distance from pseudostem of the plant. The first, 2nd and 3rd dose of urea, labelled single superphosphate and muriate of potash was applied to banana at early vegetative (8th leaf/65 DAP), late vegetative (16th leaf/115 DAP) and bud differentiation stages (165 DAP). Higher 32P absorption (dpm/g of dry matter) in leaf was observed in the treatments supplied 100 per cent of recommended dose of fertilizers at closer distance of 15 to 35 cm distance from pseudostem during first split application and at middle distance of 35 to 55 cm from pseudostem during second and third split application. The maximum per cent phosphorus derived from fertilizer (% Pdff) was also recorded with the application of 100 per cent recommended dose of P fertilizers in the middle distance of 35-55 cm from the pseudostem of the experimental plant. No significant difference was observed in the leaves of Robusta banana. The study has brought out the differential nature of the absorption pattern in treated plant and border plants with different levels and placement of fertilizers. Radiophosphorus applied to the root zone was absorbed by the treated plant and the neighbouring plants. © 2014, Society for Plant Research. All Rights Reserved.

Enset [Ensete ventricosum (Welw.) Cheesman (Musaceae)] is a multi-purpose and drought-tolerant crop, traditionally grown in Ethiopia. Food from enset has nutritive values similar to potato; it could improve food and livelihood security for many in larger geographical areas. Agronomical advice is needed which requires increased knowledge of management techniques. The purposes of this study were to (i) compare traditional corm pre-treatments when planting for sucker production, (ii) compare all six officially released cultivars regarding sprouting and (iii) investigate the effect of watering on newly buried corms. Emergence rate and number and characteristics of sprouts were recorded. Corms, from 63 two year old plants, were buried in local soil supplied with cow manure in Wolaita Sodo, Ethiopia. Emergence was recorded daily. After nine months, including one rainy season, all suckers (totally 4405) were harvested and individually recorded. Regardless of cultivar, minimum time to emergence was 50 days. Sprouts from split parent corms emerged earlier than from entire. Emergence occurred from 100% of corms, number of sprouts was strongly correlated to cultivar: average 28-106. The cultivars responded similarly to corm splitting: the more pieces the corm was split into, the more sprouts per parent corm. Average pseudostem diameter of the seven largest per parent corm: 8-10 cm for all cultivars, leaf length: 3.1-3.7 m, remaining 2700 smaller suckers: diameter 3 cm (SD 1.8). Watering decreased the average time to emergence and levelled out the differences between pre-treatments. The traditional belief is that watering as well as manure on corm cause rotting; manure is therefore usually put on the soil surface. On the contrary, full emergence and unexpected large suckers may be a result of careful soil preparation with manure applied on corm directly; watering resulted in an even emergence and growth. In conclusion, vegetative propagation of enset is efficient, but methods used and agronomical advice can be improved. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2014.

The objective of this study was to agronomically characterize plants from induced chromosome doubling experiments in the Pisang Lilin parthenocarpic banana accession to select genotypes that will be used as 2n gamete donors in crosses with improved diploids to generate secondary triploids. Twenty-two plants were evaluated, of which 17 were autotetraploids. Compared with the original diploids, the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids showed significant increases in the plant height, number of living leaves at flowering and harvest, pseudostem diameter, and length and diameter of fruits; the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids also exhibited greater fruit and bunch weights compared with the original diploids. In addition, all autotetraploid plants did not exhibit any symptoms of yellow Sigatoka. Female fertility was also detected, as some plants produced seeds, indicating that they can be used as female parents. Therefore, the autotetraploids characterized in this study exhibited useful agronomical traits to be used as 2n gamete donors for generating secondary triploids. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Being one of the important tropical and subtropical fruit trees, banana (Musa.spp.) belongs to the family Musaceae and the order Scitaminae with two genera, Musa and Ensete. In a field survey, research team has discovered a potential banana mutant strain ‘HD-1’ with a sound economic value. The results of the finding are as follows: based on Simmonds’ classification, the pseudostem of banana strain ‘HD-1’ is relatively short and purplish red; its upright outward petiole groove has red edges and wraps its pseudostem loosely. Its ploidy is 3×, AAA type. Karyotype analysis shows that the number of chromosomes is 33, the karyotype formula is 2n=3x=33=2L + 3 M2 + 4 M1 + 2 S, ‘HD-1’ is classified as ‘1B’ type. With the help of ISSR molecular markers, we find thatbanana 'HD-1' has the closest relationship with Pubei and Tianbao dwarf banana; the similarity coefficient is 0.81. In an artificial simulation tests of cold, drought and salt resistance environment changes of physiological and biochemical indexes indicate that ‘HD-1’ exhibits stronger defense capability than Brazil banana. By way of inoculation with injury of root dipping method, we respectively treat two kinds of banana seedlings inoculated Banana Fusarium wilt race 4 small species. The results show that their resistance evaluation scores are 3 and 4, disease levels are ‘susceptible’ and ‘high sensitivity’ respectively. We conclude that ‘HD-1’ has stronger resistance ability toFusarium wilt than Brazil banana. © 2016, Pakistan Botanical Society. All rights reserved.

Bacterial diseases of bananas and enset have not received, until recently, an equal amount of attention compared to other major threats to banana production such as the fungal diseases black leaf streak (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) and Fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense). However, bacteria cause significant impacts on bananas globally and management practices are not always well known or adopted by farmers. Bacterial diseases in bananas and enset can be divided into three groups: (1) Ralstoniaassociated diseases (Moko/Bugtok disease caused by Ralstonia solanacearum and banana blood disease caused by R. syzygii subsp. celebesensis); (2) Xanthomonas wilt of banana and enset, caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum and (3) Erwinia-associated diseases (bacterial head rot or tip-over disease Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora and E. chrysanthemi), bacterial rhizome and pseudostem wet rot (Dickeya paradisiaca formerly E. chrysanthemi pv. paradisiaca). Other bacterial diseases of less widespread importance include: bacterial wilt of abaca, Javanese vascular wilt and bacterial fingertip rot (probably caused by Ralstonia spp., unconfirmed). This review describes global distribution, symptoms, pathogenic diversity, epidemiology and the state of the art for sustainable disease management of the major bacterial wilts currently affecting banana and enset. © 2017 Blomme, Dita, Jacobsen, Pérez Vicente, Molina, Ocimati, Poussier and Prior.

Ethnopharmacological relevance Musa acuminata, the wild species of banana is a plant of the tropical and subtropical regions. Over the past few decades, the health benefits of M. acuminata have received much attention. All parts of the plant including fruits, peel, pseudostem, corm, flowers, leaves, sap and roots have found their use in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. Literature review have indicated use of M. acuminata in the treatment of various diseases such as fever, cough, bronchitis, dysentery, allergic infections, sexually transmitted infections, and some of the non-communicable diseases. The reported pharmacological activities of M. acuminata include antioxidant, antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, hypolipidemic, anticancer, and antimicrobial especially anti-HIV activity. This review presents information on the phytochemicals and pharmacological studies to validate the traditional use of different parts of M. acuminata in various diseases and ailments. A comprehensive assessment of the biological activities of M. acuminata extracts is included and possible mechanisms and phytochemicals involved have also been correlated to provide effective intervention strategies for preventing or managing diseases. Materials and methods A literature search was performed on M. acuminata using ethnobotanical textbooks, published articles in peer-reviewed journals, local magazines, unpublished materials, and scientific databases such as Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. The Plant List, Promusa, Musalit, the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) databases were used to validate the scientific names and also provide information on the subspecies and cultivars of M. acuminata. Result and discussion The edible part of M. acuminata provides energy, vitamins and minerals. All other parts of the plant have been used in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. The rich diversity of phytochemicals present in them probably contributes to their beneficial effects, and validates the role of M. acuminata plant parts used by various tribes and ethnic groups across the geographical areas of the world. Conclusion This review presents information on phytochemicals and pharmacological activities of M. acuminata plant parts. Pharmacological studies support the traditional uses of the plant, and probably validate the uses of M. acuminata by the indigenous people to treat and heal many infections and diseases. Some studies on animal models have been carried out, which also provide evidence of efficacy of the M. acuminata plant as a therapeutic agent. These observations suggest that M. acuminata plant parts possesses pluripharmacological properties, and can be used in designing potent therapeutic agents. However, individual bioactive constituent(s) from different parts of this plant need further investigations to confirm various pharmacological claims, and to explore the potential of M. acuminata in the development of drugs and use in functional foods. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd

Cultivation of banana in modified high density planting systems with more crop cycles is widely followed in Gujarath, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu states of India due to its higher productivity and lower cost of production. In this system, three suckers were planted in a pit spaced at 1.8 × 3.6 m accommodating 1542 mats or 4626 plants/ha. Nematode pests remain a threat to this modified system of banana cultivation especially in ratoon cycles. Investigations were undertaken in ratoon banana grown under a high density planting system on effect of cartap hydrochloride 4G, carbofuran 3G, Glomus mosseae, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Sunhemp, Coriander, Marigold, and neem cake on control mixed populations of burrowing nematode, Radopholus similis, and spiral nematode, Helicotylenchus multicinctus. Application of cartap hydrochloride @ 20 g/mat twice at the time of ratooning followed by 4 months later gave greater control of R. similis and H. multicinctus in soil and root with lesser damage in root and corm than untreated plants. The banana plants in this treatment were taller with a larger number of leaves and thicker pseudostem girth resulting in 33.4–37.3% more bunch yield than other treatments including control. The effect of cartap hydrochloride at 20 g/mat was similar at higher dose (40 g/mat) but significantly superior than 10 g/mat dose. Carbofuran 3 G @ 80 g/mat twice, Neem cake @ 250 g/mat twice and growing Marigold around the basin and incorporating before flowering were the next best treatments on nematode control and growth promotion. The P. fluorescens and G. mosseae applied were not established well and caused lesser nematode control in ratoon banana grown under high density planting system. Hence application of cartap hydrochloride @ 20 g/mat or neem cake @ 250 g/mat or growing Marigold around the basin and incorporating before flowering could rectify the damage caused by R. similis and H. multicinctus in ratoon banana crops growing under a high density planting system. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

This paper presents the morphological classification of 19 Musa species and cultivars. Fifteen morphological characters for Musa acuminata and M. balbisiana and 50 morphological characters adapted from International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plant (UPOV) codes were employed to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship between both banana species. Analyses of genetic similarity based on all of these morphological characters suggested that bananas with A-genomes were in the same cluster. Moreover, a genetic similarity coefficient of 0.36 was obtained between M. acuminata and M. balbisiana in the analysis with the 15 morphological characters for both species, and 0.47 in the analysis with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) of the 15 morphological characters suggested that PCI and PC2 together explained 78.6% of the total variance. A PCA with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that PCI explained 80.6% of the total variance, for which the main variables were pseudostem length, leaf blade length, and peduncle length. PCA of the 15 morphological characters showed that 'Pei Chiao', 'Giant Cavendish', and 'Dwarf Cavendish' were proximal in the PCA scatterplot. Notably, the PCA of 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that 'Pei Chiao' and 'Giant Cavendish' were near each other in the PCA scatterplot, suggesting that they are phylogenetically related. The PCA of M. itinerans var.formosana with 15 morphological descriptors showed that this variant is phylogenetically distant from M. acuminata and M. balbisiana accessions. In summary, the findings may contribute to the classification and breeding of banana germplasm. © 2018 Kyushu University. All rights reserved.

Morphological traits are routinely used to characterize the banana varieties but are unable to precisely discriminate the closely resembling ones. Current study explores the five common banana varieties using 41 qualitative traits and discriminating traits are shortlisted based on uniformity within variety (zero Shannon index), differences between varieties (varying mode scores across varieties and significant binomial distribution of mode class from non-mode class). Five traits at vegetative stage (leaf habit, leaf blotch color, color of midrib leaf dorsal surface, petiole canal area, and pigment under pseudostem) are useful as unique descriptors for quick discrimination of five banana varieties at 62.5–100% accuracy levels. © 2021, The National Academy of Sciences, India.

Background. Enset (Ensete ventricosum (Welw.) Cheesman) is an important staple crop for more than 20 million people in Ethiopia. Precise ethnobotanical information of intraspecific enset diversity and local knowledge on how farmers maintain, manage, and benefit from enset genetic resources is imperative for the promotion, conservation, and improvement of enset and its farming system. The aim of this study was to identify and document the wealth of indigenous knowledge associated with the distribution, diversity, and management of enset in Adola Rede District. Methods. The study was conducted in Adola Rede District of Guji Zone, Oromia, Ethiopia. To identify and document the wealth of indigenous knowledge, the data were collected mainly through individual interviews and observation with 139 farm households and key informant interviews. Results. Thirty-four landraces were identified. The number of landraces cultivated in individual households ranged from 3 to 14 (mean of 6.08 ± 2.17). The farmers distinguish landraces primarily using morphological features such as pseudostem color, midrib color, plant height, and leaf color. Agronomic characteristics such as resistance to disease and pest and maturity time were secondary criteria for the identification of enset landraces in the study area. Enset is mainly used as food (kocho, bulla, and amicho) and source of fiber, and it has also medicinal value for both humans and livestock. Farmers prefer a landrace to the other, for example, Gantichoo for worqee (kocho) and fiber, Adoo for budhaa (bulla), Nimfoo for amicho, and Astaraa for medicinal use. The majority of the informants (74.10%) have got their plant material by multiplying planting material by themselves, exchanging with neighbors (16.50%), and purchasing from the market (9.40%). Conclusion. There was relatively high on-farm enset landrace diversity, and the indigenous people had a long tradition of enset cultivation, conservation, and maintenance of landraces in the district. The information is crucial for developing community-based complementary in situ and ex situ conservation strategies to foster conservation of enset genetic resources and associated indigenous knowledge system. © 2022 Wendawek A.

RNA of Musa cultivars under different status of pest infestation exhibited significant difference on quantity and quality. Differential display reverse transcription of RNA extracted from two AAB Musa cultivars, of which one is susceptible and other is resistant to infestation by Odoiporus longicollis Olivier, showed sharp difference on the banding pattern of cDNA. Susceptible Palayankodan and resistant Thenkaali exhibited 13 shared bands. As the susceptible cultivar showed 30 unique bands, resistant cultivar exhibited 56 bands. Identical study done in Musa cultivars of different genome constitution and ploidy such as susceptible Kappa (AAA) and resistant Aadinkombu (AA), there was sharp decrease on the on the number of shared bands and it was only nine. Here also number of unique bands are as high as 55 in resistant cultivar and 36 in susceptible Kappa. Proteins, the translation products of RNA also exhibited increase on the number of bands in resistant cultivars than to that of susceptible cultivars. Additionally expressed proteins in resistant cultivars indicated more active genes in them and some of which may confer pest resistance. Differential expression of genes responsible for the synthesis of secondary metabolites make Musa cultivars either susceptible or resistant to infestation by O. longicollis, which completes the whole lifecycle in the pseudostem of banana and plantains. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The National Academy of Sciences, India.

Musa cultivars (bananas and plantains) are important crops in the humid tropics of Africa, America and Asia. This paper reports the extent of morphological variation of the Musa germplasm maintained in the gene-bank of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in southeastern Nigeria. Qualitative and quantitative descriptors were used to evaluate AA, BB, AB, AAA, AAB, AAAA, AAAB and AABB bananas, AAA and ABB cooking bananas, AAA beer bananas and AAB plantains and a few wild species. Univariate and principal component (PCA) analyses were performed to identify the most important descriptors to characterize and classify Musa germplasm collections. The most important qualitative morphological descriptors were persistence of male bud and hermaphrodite flowers, pigmentation in pseudostem, foliage, petiole and male flower, pseudostem blotching and waxiness, and leaf orientation. Furthermore, the most important quantitative morphological descriptors included pseudostem girth, height of tallest sucker, number of fruits and fruit sizes. These quantitative descriptors have a high heritability (>0.8), high repeatibility (>2.0)and low coefficient of variation (9-15%) with the exception of the height of the tallest sucker. The implications of the germplasm grouping revealed by PCA are briefly discussed in relation to the evolution of the triploid cultivars. This paper also proposes a new scientific nomenclature for the triploid Musa cultivars.

Banana (Musa spp.) is a major semi-perennial fruit crop in Sri Lanka. A study was conducted at the Regional Agricultural Research and Development Centre, Angunakolapelessa to investigate the effect of age on growth and yield of banana cv Mysore ("Embul", AAB group). Thirty-seven "Embul" banana accessions collected from various ecological regions of Sri Lanka were studied in a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replicates. The observations were recorded in three consecutive years. Number of leaves per clump, LAI (leaf area index) and penetration of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to the crop were recorded at 4, 9, 20 and 32 months after planting. Pseudostem height and girth of the crop were investigated at different ages. Number of combs and fruits per comb, fruit maturity period, bunch weight, total fruit weight, average fruit weight and peduncle weight were also measured. Comb weight, fruit circumference, fruit length and diameter were recorded in the second and last combs. Leaf number and LAI increased, while penetration of PAR decreased with the age. Except weight of second comb, fruit length in second comb and fruit diameter in last comb, all other characteristics varied significantly with age of the crop. Fruit maturity period increased with the age of the crop to second year and then decreased, while total fruit weight decreased up to second year and then increased. Number of fruits per comb and bunch weight significantly increased after the second year. Stem height and girth, number of fruits per bunch, weight of the peduncle and length of the male axis consistently increased with the age of the crop investigated up to the third year.

Plantains exhibit great variability in West and Central Africa, which accounts for 60% of world production. Sixteen quantitative characteristics were evaluated in 75 plantain and 18 banana cultivars during several production cycles. The extent of variation in quantitative continuous characteristics and the phenotypic correlations between them were analysed. Index descriptors based on the combination of two characteristics were calculated. Despite the significant (P &lt; 0.05) influence of the environment and the genotype-by-environment interaction, most of the variation was significantly affected by the specific genotype of the Musa accessions. The most productive cultivars were the Cavendish bananas and the giant French plantains (&gt; 30 t ha-1 year-1). Five phenotypic correlations were common to all known taxonomic Musa groups. Short-cycling cultivars showed early flowering, whereas tall cultivars had wide plant girth and many leaves. The number of fruit per bunch was significantly associated with the number of hands (or nodal clusters of fruit). The most important component of yield potential was bunch weight in all Musa cultivars, and days to harvest only in the dessert bananas derived from interspecific crosses of M. acuminata. Index descriptors may be useful for selection of traits that are difficult to score or that show a high coefficient of variation. Short Musa cultivars may be selected by calculating the index of pseudostem condensation. A low value of pseudostem condensation (&lt; 9 cm leaf-1) was characteristic of known dwarf plantain and banana cultivars.

Between 1991 to 1996, more than 50 Musa hybrids and 10 landraces were evaluated under field and screenhouse conditions for virus symptoms resembling those caused by banana streak badnavirus (BSV). The symptoms included chlorotic streaks, leaf deformation, stunting, cigar leaf death, distortion of the peduncle, bunch or fruits, and internal pseudostem necrosis. Immunosorbent electron microscopy (ISEM) of randomly selected plants with one or more of these symptoms confirmed the presence of BSV particles in 15 tropical Musa plantain hybrids (TMPx) and five Musa landraces. Under both field and screenhouse conditions, the incidence of symptomatic plants in the hybrids was significantly higher than in the landraces. The hybrids also generally had a higher concentration of BSV antigens, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). By contrast, most BSV-infected landraces were symptomless and had very low or undetectable amounts of BSV antigens. There was a significant variation in incidence of symptomatic plants between genotypes, experiments and year of observation. These results are discussed in relation to the higher natural BSV incidence observed on some Musa hybrids as compared with their parental genotypes.

Plantain (Musa spp. AAB, French, cv. Essong) was grown on an acid ultisol in southern Cameroon to determine yield response to (1) a hot-water treatment to control nematodes and (2) the application of fertilizer. Observations were made for 42 months. Establishment was unaffected by hot-water treatment or fertilizer. Hot-water treatment reduced nematode infestation to about 30% of that found in untreated plants and increased rhizome survival by 11%. Fertilizer application increased the proportion of bunch-producing plants from 44 to 65% through reduced die-back, toppling and pseudostem breakage during the dry season but had no effect on bunch weight per plant. Fresh bunch yield of the plant-crop was 10.2 Mg ha-1 in unfertilized, untreated, plots; fertilized plots produced 15.3 Mg ha-1 and hot-water treated plots 13 Mg ha-1. Fertilized and hot-water treated plots produced 20.8 Mg ha-1. First ratoon yields were unaffected by fertilizer, but increased due to hot-water treatment from 0.81 to 5.0 Mg ha-1. Plant-crop bunch weight decreased with increasing time between planting and harvest. Mean bunch fresh weight was negatively correlated with an index of root nematode infestation and positively correlated with the number of living roots. For the plant-crop and plant-crop plus ratoon yields, the yield increase due to combined use of fertilizer and hot-water treatment was larger than increases attained by individual measures. Thus combination of hot-water treatment and fertilizer had a synergistic effect on plantain fresh bunch yield, justifying introduction of both measures simultaneously.

Scientific strategies for crop improvement ensue from genetic knowledge gain from the relevant breeding populations. Few genetic studies were undertaken in Musa before the 1990s, despite the importance of the crop in human diet in the tropics. It was believed that genetic studies of most cultivated Musa, a virtually sterile triploid crop, were impossible. This explains the absence, until recently, of inheritance studies in triploid plantain and banana and the lack of genetic markers. Although several characteristics of the Musa crop make genetic analysis difficult, the production of euploid test-cross segregating populations obtained from triploid-diploid crosses has made inheritance studies possible. Thus, plantain and banana genomes have been investigated at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) since 1992. This paper provides insight into the genetics of black sigatoka and banana weevil resistance, pseudostem waxiness, virus susceptibility, apical dominance and suckering behavior, dwarfism, bunch orientation, fruit parthenocarpy, and male fertility. It also discusses the effects of genetic markers, ploidy and the environment on quantitative variation of disease and pest resistance as well as growth parameters of yield. This new knowledge has provided important information to develop IITA's scientific breeding strategy for the genetic improvement of plantain and banana.

Host location, acceptance and larval success were studied in a mixed cultivar trial consisting of three East African cooking bananas, two East African beer banana and Kayinja (an exotic cultivar used for beer making). Weevil damage to the endemic cultivars was 5 to 25 times higher than that of Kayinja. Capture of weevils in pseudostem traps at the base of banana mats was highest for Kayinja, while egg density on Kayinja was similar to that of four endemic cultivars. Therefore, host location and acceptance do not appear to be factors in host plant resistance. In contrast, larval survivorship indices were 10 to 23 times higher in endemic cultivars than in Kayinja suggesting that larval success may be an important factor in resistance to banana weevils. Timing of attack was similar among cultivars. Oviposition occurred throughout the banana cycle with egg density increasing with plant age. These data provide a possible explanation of differences in weevil attack found among banana cultivars in Uganda.

The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development. Host plant resistance offers another promising avenue of control. Numerous resistant clones are known, including Yangambi-km 5, Calcutta 4, and Pisang awak. Resistance is most often through antibiosis resulting in egg or larval failure. Banana breeding is a slow and difficult process. Current research is exploring genetic improvement through biotechnology techniques including the introduction of foreign genes. Neem has also shown potential for control of banana weevil. Studies on the use of other botanicals against banana weevil have failed to produce positive results. Chemical control of banana weevil remains a common and effective method for larger scale producers but is beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers. However, the weevil has displayed the ability to develop resistance against a broad range of chemicals. In summary, cultural control remains the most available approach for resource-poor farmers. A combination of several cultural methods is likely to reduce weevil pressure. Among the methods currently under study, microbial control, host plant resistance and neem appear to offer the most promise.

In an attempt to explain the difference in banana (Musa AAA cv. Grand Naine) plants with poor, regular, and good development, their root stratification and spatial distribution was determined in Costa Rican field conditions. Samples were taken from soil blocks at 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm distances from the pseudostem, and at every 15cm depth, from 0 to 120cm in non-flowering plants that were 180-190cm high. The plant development sites did affect the proportion of fresh thick roots (> 5 mm-d) as follows: 49, 63, and 56% in plants with poor, regular, and good development, respectively. The lateral distribution of thick and fine (1 to 5mm-d) roots and root hairs was affected by the horizontal distance from the pseudostem. The total percentage of roots decreased as horizontal distance increased in any plant development. Soil depth affected the distribution of every flesh root type throughout the soil profile. The total fresh root weight in the excavated area (0-90 cm from the pseudostem and 0-120cm depth) was 0.95, 0.9, and 0.76kg, for poor, regular, and good developed plants, respectively. Therefore, the explanation for regular and good plants more likely was the depth of the root system, which reached up to 120cm deep, while in the poor plants the roots reached only 75 cm deep. Additional studies that relate the root stratification with crop yield are encouraged.

Banana and plantains rank fourth among the most important food crops of the world, and India holds the position of the largest producer. A study was undertaken to evaluate the potential yield of new synthetic banana hybrids based on bunch weight and fruit quality. It also assessed the nematode damage, Sigatoka leaf spot disease and parthenocarpy stability. Materials and methods. Thirteen new hybrids and eleven parental bananas of dessert type were used and evaluated in the first vegetative generation. Plant growth parameters, viz., pseudostem height and girth, number of leaves, and suckers per plant were measured at the flowering stage and the damage of roots by nematode and intensity of the Sigatoka leaf spot disease were assessed at the harvest stage. The content of total soluble solids, and reducing, non-reducing and total sugars in the fruit was estimated. Results. All the hybrids exhibited parthenocarpy and there was no reversion from parthenocarpy to non-parthenocarpy. The plant height and girth and the leaf number varied among the hybrids significantly. The maximum bunch weight was recorded for H-212 (ABB) which showed a regular suckering habit, very high content of total soluble solids and reducing sugars, and more leaves without leaf spot infection than the other hybrids; moreover, H-212 is a female sterile dessert-type banana and it is tolerant to nematode and resistant to Sigatoka. The reproduction factor of Radopholus similis on H-211 (AA), H-213 (ABB) and H-02-01 (AA) was significantly lower than on H-203 (AA), H-209 (ABB) and H-205 (AA). Conclusions. Our studies distinguished one triploid ABB hybrid H-212 with high yield and fruit quality, and no sanitary problems; it can be released for commercial cultivation to banana growers. © 2004 Cirad/EDP Sciences.

In order to identify the effect of burrowing nematodes on the shoots (pseudostem and leaves) of banana plants and to determine whether or not shoot characteristics are associated with plant resistance to nematodes two experiments were conducted in controlled conditions within polytunnels. The banana plants were harvested on three occasions for the measurement of root morphology and biomass. Varieties differed in their resistance to nematodes from resistant (Yg Km5, FHIA 17, FHIA 03) and partly resistant (FHIA 01, FHIA 25) to not resistant (FHIA 23, Williams). Nematodes reduced total plant dry weight at the first harvest in Experiment 1 and by an average of 8.8% in Experiment 2, but did not affect leaf area in either experiment. The ratio of above-ground weight to total plant weight was reduced from 75% to 72% in nematode-infected plants compared with the control plants for all varieties tested in Experiment 1, but was only reduced in FHIA 25 and FHIA 23 in Experiment 2. Varieties differed in above-ground growth. The FHIA varieties had greater shoot weights and leaf area than YgKm5 and Williams. Overall, resistance to nematodes was associated with the partitioning of a greater proportion of biomass to the roots than to above-ground parts. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

An agronomic study was conducted to evaluate three Musa hybrids (BITA-3 - cooking banana, FHIA-21 and CRBP-39- both hybrid plantains) with five hundred farmers in the two Assin districts in the Central region of Ghana. At harvest sensory evaluation was carried out on the three hybrids for use as fufu, ampesi and ripe fried plantain to access their acceptability at four locations in the two districts. The results showed that there was no significant difference (p<0.05) between the numbers of leaves at flowering among the hybrids across the locations. The hybrids showed superiority over the local check in terms of number of functional leaves from flowering to harvest. All the hybrids (FHIA-21, CRBP 39, BITA-3 and FHIA-25) exhibited stable performance in yield and growth characteristics across the locations. FHIA-25 was however late maturing (18-20 months) whereas BITA-3 was early maturing (10-12 months). Nevertheless, the bunch weight (40-50 kg) of FHIA-25 could be said to have compensated for the long crop cycle. Daughter sucker production by FHIA-25 was also low (two daughter suckers at flowering). BITA-3 was roboust and sturdy with pseudostem girth of 60 cm carrying an average bunch weight of 25 kg. All the hybrids were resistant to the black Sigatoka disease. These results suggested that the performance of the hybrids was not influenced by the seasons or locations. It implies that under good management practices, farmers would be assured of good yields irrespective of time or season of planting so long as there is adequate supply of moisture. The results of the sensory evaluation indicated that there were no significant differences (p<0.01) between FHIA-21 and CRBP-39 and the local Apantu across the location, across the parameters and the recipes assessed. FHIA-21 and CRBP-39 were the most prefened and compared favourably with the local triploids (Apantu and Apem) with BITA-3 the least preferred. The hybrids were accepted for ripe fried plantain at stages 3 and 4 of ripening. Beyond these stages of ripening, the hybrids could only be used for other processed food recipes. © 2008 Academic Journals Inc.

World production of bananas, estimated at 106 million tons (Lescot 2006), ranks fourth in agricultural production. Bananas make up the largest production of fruits and the largest international trade, more than apple, orange, grape and melon. Bananas are cultivated in more than 120 countries in tropical and subtropical zones on 5 continents. Banana products represent an essential food resource and have an important socioeconomic and ecological role. Current varieties are generally seedless triploid clones either of the single genome A from the species Musa acuminata (group AAA) or of both genomes A and B from species M. acuminata and Musa balbisiana (groups AAB and ABB). More rarely, diploid varieties (AA and AB) and tetraploid clones are encountered. There are two major channels of banana production: those cultivated for export and those reserved for local markets. The main banana varieties cultivated for export, known as Grande Naine, Poyo and Williams, belong to the monospecific triploid bananas (AAA) of the Cavendish sub-group. They differ from each other only in somatic mutations such as plant height or bunch and fruit shape. Their production relies on an intensive monoculture of the agro-industrial type, without rotation, and a high quantity of inputs. Banana cultivation for local consumption is based on a large number of varieties adapted to different conditions of production as well as the varied uses and tastes of consumers. Diploid bananas, close to the ancestral wild forms, are still cultivated in Southeast Asia. In other regions, triploid clones belonging to different sub-groups Plantain, Silk, Lujugira, Gros Michel, Pisang Awak are the most widely distributed. Bananas have many uses. They are not only consumed as fresh fruits but also cooked, like plantains. They are processed in various ways, into chips, fries, fritters, purees, jams, ketchup and alcohol (banana wine and beer have a very significant production in East Africa). The daily per capita consumption of bananas from 30 g to over 500 g in some East African countries. Apart from the fruit, other parts of the plant are also used: the pseudostem is used for its fibres and as floaters (Musa textilis or abacá) in the Philippines, and the leaves are used to make shelters or roofs or as wraps for cooking. In Thailand, the floral buds of particular varieties (Pisang Awak) are used in various culinary preparations. Some varieties are also considered to have medicinal properties. Cultivated throughout the world, bananas are threatened by several diseases and pests (Stover and Simmonds 1987; Jones 1999) that need to be taken into account for banana improvement. Various major fungal diseases are constraints in industrial production and, to a lesser degree, in local production. For example, Sigatoka disease (SD) due to Mycosphaerella musicola and black leaf streak disease (BLSD) caused by M. fijiensis result in production losses in large industrial plantations and necessitate costly pest control measures to be adopted. In certain production zones, Fusarium wilt due to the soil fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense prevents the cultivation of susceptible varieties like the Gros Michel types. Great constraints are also exerted by the nematodes Radopholus similis and several representatives of the genus pratylenchus and by the black weevil of banana, Cosmopolites sordidus. Also, viral diseases are spreading. Those of greatest concern are due to BBTV (banana bunchy top virus), CMV (cucumber mosaic virus), BSV (banana streak virus) and BBMV (banana bract mosaic virus). Chemical control measures used in intensive cultivation are not available to small banana farmers in developing countries. Furthermore, for some diseases, there is no effective chemical control. Genetic improvement has thus been focused mainly on obtaining varieties resistant to principal pests and diseases. Breeding bananas through hybridisation, which began in the 1920s, is currently being pursued at seven research centres. FHIA in Honduras is breeding banana for export as well as the cooking types (Rowe 1984). EMBRAPA-CNPMF in Brazil (Dantas et al. 1993), NRCB and TNAU in India (Sathiamoorthy et al. 2000; Krishnamoorthy and Kumar 2004) aim at breeding local types of dessert and cooking bananas. CARBAP (Jenny et al. 2003) in Cameroon and IITA (Tenkouano and Swennen 2004) in Nigeria are conducting research on plantain and banana breeding in Africa. These six research centres are mainly interested in developing new tetraploid varieties by crossing triploid varieties and wild or improved diploid clones with resistance to diseases. Some secondary triploids derived from crosses between these new tetraploid varieties and other diploid clones were also obtained. In the French West Indies, CIRAD has conceived another crossing strategy aimed at the development of triploid varieties directly from diploid plant material (Bakry et al. 2001). Since the 1980s, apart from these conventional breeding approaches, other groups have focused on mutagenesis as at IAEA (Roux 2004) in Austria or on the selection of somaclonal variants as at TBRI (Hwang and Ko 1990) in Taiwan. These technologies appeared as a result of the development of in vitro culture techniques designed for rapid industrial multiplication of micro-propagated banana plants. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

The results of research on the water relations and irrigation need of banana are collated and summarised in an attempt to link fundamental studies on crop physiology to irrigation practices. Background information on the ecology of the banana and crop development processes, with emphasis on root growth and water uptake, is presented, followed by reviews of the influence of water stress on gas exchange (stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration), crop water use, and yield. Emphasis is placed on research that has international relevance and, where appropriate, three geographical areas (the tropics, subtropics and Mediterranean climates) are considered. Although roots can extend to depths of 1.0-1.5 m, the effective depth of rooting is usually taken to be 0-0.40 m, sometimes extending to 0.60 m. Stomatal conductance is a sensitive measure of soil water availability and plant water status, whilst transpiration rates can be limited by dry air (saturation deficits &gt;2.0 kPa). In the subtropics, there are seasonal differences in the crop coefficient (Kc) with values ranging from 0.6 in the winter months to about 1.0 Epan in the summer. It is difficult to draw generic conclusions with wide applicability from the irrigation experiments as they were reported. All the components of marketable yield can be enhanced by irrigation whilst applying insufficient water delays crop development. Annual yield responses to irrigation are variable, but water use efficiencies of 40 kg ha-1 mm-1 (fresh fruit/water applied) have been achieved in the tropics and subtropics (and elsewhere up to 80 kg ha-1 mm-1 with partial replacement of the soil water deficit). To ensure large yields of (marketable) fruit, soil water deficits must be kept low (Ψm &gt;-20 kPa at 0.2 m depth). In the subtropics, this means irrigation intervals should not exceed 2-3 d during the summer. The cooling effect of irrigation with micro-sprinklers on the soil and pseudostem temperatures, compared with drippers, can delay crop development and reduce annual yields by 30%. There is some (limited) evidence that the presence of the B genome contributes to drought tolerance. Yield response factors to irrigation for different growth stages have yet to be confirmed. Opportunities to improve the water productivity of the many, diverse banana cultivars need to be explored further. © Cambridge University Press 2009.

The salinity is a common factor of abiotic stress that seriously affects the agricultural production where it is found. One of the strategies to promote reincorporation of salinity areas and the productivity increasing consists in development and selection of tolerant genotypes, which allows parental identification for crossings. This research aimed to identify the salinity tolerance among banana diploid genotypes to be used in future works of genetic improvement to saline soils of Brazilian northeast region. Nine banana diploid genotypes (AA) were evaluated for growth variables as leaf area, height, diameter of pseudostem, leaves number, weight of fresh and dry matter. During 21 days, the plants were treated with 0 and 100 mM of NaCl, in an entirely randomized experimental delineation with three repetitions. After 21 days, the determination of fresh matter weight was released using analytic balance. The attainment of the each plant dry matter weight from foliar limbo, pseudostem and root+rizome was carried out through drying in greenhouse at 65°C until constant weight. The Tjau Lagada genotype, which suffered minor reduction of leaf area, can possibly show a higher production despite other genotypes analyzed in this study. The genotype 0116-01, presenting a greater salinity tolerance, could be used in future crossings providing genes to be incorporated in productive cultivars by improvement programs which aims the adaptive cultivars to Brazilian northeast saline soils.

Field performance of two IITA plantain hybrids ('PITA-1', 'PITA-4') were assessed at two locations in Ghana alongside two local landraces (False Horn 'Brodeyuo', Intermediate French 'Oniaba') and a hybrid cultivar 'Apem Hemaa' ('FHIA-21'). The objective of the study was to identify high yielding and disease resistant hybrids for growers in Ghana. The hybrids were evaluated for their agronomic performance and yield, tolerance to Black Sigatoka disease, number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest, crop cycle, plant height and pseudostem girth. The results showed that the hybrids were tolerant/resistant to the Black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) disease with high number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest. This characteristic of the hybrids was an important feature that could fit well into the smallholder cropping system. The crop cycles were comparable to that of 'False Horn' plantains. The yield performance of the hybrids was better compared to the landraces. The number of hands per bunch produced by the hybrids was also higher than those of the landraces except the intermediate French plantain ('Oniaba'). The finger lengths of the IITA hybrids were however shorter compared to the landraces and this could hinder their acceptance by consumers.

Use of biotechnology techniques combined with mutagenesis in Musa spp. allows genetic variability to be increased to improve important agronomic characters. Damage caused to Musa plantations by strong winds and tropical hurricanes makes it necessary to select clones with reduced height and better resistance to wind. The objective of this study is to develop mutant clones of FHIA-21 (Musa AAAB) with reduced height, a good agronomical trait. Multiple buds obtained by in vitro culture were subjected to gamma radiation from 60Co sources at dose of 25 Gy. Irradiated buds were multiplied, elongated, rooted, and then planted (10,000 plants) in the field. In the clonal study, 98 mutant clones with lower pseudostem height compared with the original cultivar were selected. Four mutants with reduced height at bunch emergency were selected (IBP 14-23, IBP 17-13, IBP 24-14, and IBP 47-4). Mutants IBP 24-14 and IBP 47-4 showed poor agronomical features, reduced foliar area, and resulted of no commercial value. The results indicated that mutant IBP 14-23 retains the character of resistance to black sigatoka from its parent FHIA-21, combined with important agronomical traits during the third culture cycle, making it a promising cultivar material, representing 0. 01% selection efficiency. This is the first report of improvement for height reduction of the tetraploid hybrid FHIA-21 through physical mutagenesis. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of Prata banana plants during three production cycles, under different irrigation systems, in semi-arid conditions. A randomized block design was adopted with six treatments, in a 3×2 factorial arrangement: three irrigation systems - conventional sprinkler, microsprinkler and drip - and two genotypes - 'Prata-Anã' and its hybrid PA42-44. Four replicates in plots with six useful plants were used. Plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of alive leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area, and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. Weight of bunch and hands, mean weight of hands, weight of the three first hands, number of hands and fruits per bunches, and weight, length and diameter of fruits and number of alive leaves were evaluated during the harvest season. The drip irrigation system provides smaller vigor to banana Prata, in comparison to conventional and to micro sprinkler systems, as can be seen by the size and perimeter of the pseudostem. The cultivar Prata-Anã shows a larger number of fruit and hands per brunch, while its hybrid PA42-44 shows larger weight, length and fruit diameter.

The conventional breeding programme at the Banana Research Station, Kannara, India has produced two dessert banana hybrids, 'BRS-1', ['Agniswar' (AAB) × 'Pisang Lilin' (AA)] and 'BRS-2', ['Vannan' (AAB) × 'Pisang Lilin'], which have been developed and released for cultivation in Kerala. These hybrids are very resistant to Sigatoka leaf spot, a trait inherited from the male parent. Current breeding strategies are focused on the improvement of 'Nendran' (AAB), the commercial French plantain cultivar of the state, for higher productivity, dwarf stature and resistance to Sigatoka leaf spot, weevil borers and nematodes utilizing wild/natural/bred diploids. Though limited by low levels of female fertility, development of plantain hybrids resistant to black leaf streak based on triploid/diploid crosses has been reported. Female-fertile clones of 'Nendran' identified in the genebank were pollinated with the wild Musa acuminata ssp. burmannicoides 'Calcutta-4', highly resistant to Sigatoka leaf spot. Low seed set and germination reduced the recovery of hybrids for evaluation. One hybrid progeny resulting from the cross ['Nendran' clone 'Chengalikodan' × 'Calcutta 4'] with close resemblance to the female parent recorded a plant height of 360 cm, pseudostem girth of 62 cm and 12 leaves at shooting. It registered a bunch weight of 13 kg with 8 hands and 90 fruits. Unlike its susceptible female parent, the hybrid displayed very high resistance to Sigatoka leaf spot, imparted by the male parent. Being male- and female-fertile, the hybrid is being back-crossed with 'Nendran' and crossed with selected diploids. Embryo culture is being standardised to improve the recovery of hybrid progeny.

Nutrient composition, secondary plant substances and other host quality characteristics govern resistance and influence herbivore feeding. The current study was carried out to compare aspects of feeding behaviour and food utilization of banana weevil (Germar) (Coleptera: Curculionidae) larvae feeding on banana cultivars with different levels of resistance. In the first study, penetration times of larvae into tissue of seven banana cultivars (two susceptible, three intermediate and four resistant) were compared. Day-old larvae were placed on corm or pseudostem tissue of these cultivars and time taken to penetrate the tissue was recorded. Larvae generally took longer to tunnel into resistant cultivars, although Yangambi Km5 (resistant) did not fit this pattern. In the second set of studies, food consumption and growth of larvae were compared on cultivars: (i) Kisubi (resistant) vs. Atwalira (susceptible); and (ii) Mbwazirume (intermediate) vs. Kayinja (resistant). Day-old larvae were offered weighed pieces of corm that were changed every 4-7days. At each corm change, weights of the larvae, corms and frass were measured. Changes in corm and larval weight were calculated to determine larval growth and amount of tissue consumed. Larvae feeding on resistant cultivars had lower consumption and growth rates and longer developmental duration. It was concluded that low food consumption rates contribute to delayed development of larvae feeding on resistant cultivars. Differences between resistant and susceptible cultivars in food utilization may be of limited consequence for the cultivars tested. This is one step in identifying the factors influencing weevil development rates in cultivars of different resistance levels. If these factors are identified, they can be targeted in breeding for resistance. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag, GmbH.

Banana cultivars have been classified into genome groups based on their morphological characters. Modern molecular tools are available to support characterisation, identification of hybridisation and analysis of evolutionary trends. Two wild species, Musa acuminata ssp. burmannicoides 'Cacutta-4' (female parent) and Musa balbisiana 'Bee Hee Kela' (male parent) collected from Northeastern Hilly region of India, were crossed to produce F1 populations of the AB type with characters from the heterozygous parents. Seed set was very high (3552 seeds) and 317 seedlings germinated. About 150 seedlings were maintained for further evaluation and molecular mapping. Plant height was dwarf to medium, similar to 'Calcutta-4'. The pseudostem was green with few black-brown blotches, expressing both characters, but less waxy, which is characteristic of the 'A' genome. For the 52 hybrids that flowered, most bunches were horizontal, showing the AB character. However, there was good segregation for male flower colour. The colour varied from cream to pink-purple with gradations of pink (31% of the observed progeny). It was observed that 40% of the F1 population studied did not produce any pollen and was totally sterile, unlike the parent accessions. These F1 populations could serve as useful material for studying segregation of different morphological characters and molecular mapping.

Fungal diseases of banana can be classed into diseases of the foliage, diseases of the root, corm and pseudostem and diseases of the fruit, including those at post harvest, such as anthracnose. Of these, the most important are the fungal disease of the foliage caused by black sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) and the wilt disease of the pseudostem caused by the four races of Panama disease (Fusarium oxysporum fm sp cubense). The monoculture of dessert bananas for urban consumption and the export trade has facilitated the spread of black sigatoka, such that serial applications of fungicides are obligatory in most production areas of the world. In addition, the production of susceptible plantains by smallholders has become unsustainable in many areas due to high costs and difficulty in applying fungicides without the use of airplanes. After the advent of Panama disease in the 20th century, wilt resistant Cavendish dessert bananas replaced the susceptible banana 'Gros Michel' as the principal bananas in the export trade; however, these plantations are now threatened by a new race of Panama disease (Tropical race 1V) which is now present and spreading in S.E. Asia. Here we review the most significant advances in both basic and applied scientific understanding of these two disease complexes which have been made in the last two decades. A full review of fungal diseases (of which there are more than 40) which affect bananas and plantains has been given in Jones [2000]. The present review deals with advances in research into the two most important diseases, black sigatoka (causal agent Mycosphaerella fijiensis) and Fusarium wilt tropical race 4 (Fusarium oxysporum f sp cubense). © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The physicochemical properties of plantain (Musa paradisiaca) and banana (Musa sapientum) pseudostem wastes have been determined. It was found that the average moisture content for both samples were very high while the concentrations of solubles in both cold and hot water were moderate, the concentrations of the solubles of the pulverized pseudostems in 1:2v/v ethanol-benzene solution mixture were higher than those of 18% NaOH. The mineral elements detected in the leaf-fold and the core of both Musa paradisiaca and Musa sapientum pseudostem wastes were Na, K, Cr, Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu, and P. Pb was present in trace concentrations in only the banana leaf-folds. The phytochemical composition in mg/100g for the plantain and banana pseudostem wastes were: oxalates (66.28±2.01, 41.56±2.55); phytates (3.78±0.05, 3.23±0.33); tannins (7.99±0.26, 6.55±0.33); and cyanogenic glycosides (1.47±0.14, 1.44±0.33) respectively. Flavonoids, saponins and alkaloids were present in both varieties, but steroids were absent. The values of lignin ranged between 2.28 and 7.30% pseudostems, the carbohydrate between 39.71 and 62.21 mg/100g for plantain and 42.13 and 93.82 mg/100g for banana pseudostems while the pentosan content for both ranged between 6.67 and 11.73 mg/100g. Generally, plantain, pseudostems waste contains higher values of the phytochemicals than the banana pseudostems except the pentosen content; both contain high amount of carbohydrate which can be exploited for the preparation of pulp for paper making and for production of cellulose derivatives and sugar.

The objective of this study was to examine the molecular and phenotypic variability of 'Prata Anã' banana clones cultivated in northern Minas Gerais State. For the phenotypic and molecular characterization, the clones were collected from five properties. The morphological characterization of 20 clones was accomplished through a qualitative evaluation of 74 descriptors. For the molecular evaluations, 45 clones were collected, and 14 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA primers were used. Among the 74 morphological descriptors evaluated in the 20 'Prata Anã' banana tree clones, 53 descriptors presented in the same homogeneous class for all clones. The presence of anthocyanin in the pseudostem (ANT) and the shape (BUS) and flexion (FLX) of the bunch clearly differentiated the 'Prata Anã' banana clones from the commercial cultivar. A total of 176 bands were produced from the molecular analysis using the 14 RAPD primers; there were 116 monomorphic and 60 polymorphic bands, with an average polymorphism percentage of 52.2%. The amplification using the OPP 14 primer resulted in the greatest percentage of polymorphic bands at 88%. The dendrogram indicated that each of the 45 'Prata Anã' clones that were evaluated using RAPD markers clustered with the commercial 'Prata Anã' cultivar.

Banana genotypes grown under different irrigation systems may express different vegetative traits and yields, even if all other crop conditions are similar. This study aimed to evaluate the vegetative traits of two banana genotypes of the Pome subgroup (AAB) under different irrigation systems in semiarid conditions during three production cycles. The experimental design was a randomized block design with six treatments in a 3×2 factorial scheme: three irrigation systems (sprinkler, micro-sprinkler and drip) and two genotypes ('Dwarf Pome' and 'BRS Platina', earlier reported as 'PA42-44'). Four replications were used, with six plants spaced at 3.0×2.5 m per net plot. Plant height, pseudostem girth, number of functional leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. In addition the number of functional leaves, weight of bunch and number of hands was also evaluated at harvest. Interactions between the treatments were not significant. Irrigation systems affected vegetative traits. The drip irrigation system reduced growth as measured by plant height and pseudostem girth, for both genotypes, compared with conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems. The weight of the bunch in the second cycle and the number of hands in the third cycle were higher for plants grown under conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems compared to drip irrigation. The 'Dwarf Pome' showed higher number of hands per bunch than 'BRS Platina'.

Introduction. Mycosphaerella fijiensis, the fungal pathogen causing Black Sigatoka disease, attacks almost all cultivars of bananas and plantains. Currently, the repeated application of fungicides is the most widespread control measure, while the use of bio-control agents remains almost ignored. Here we investigated, under in vitro culture conditions, whether an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF - Rhizophagus irregularis MUCL 41833) could reduce the severity of disease caused by M. fijiensis MUCL 47740 on banana. Materials and methods. Prior to their transfer to autotrophic in vitro culture systems and subsequent inoculation by the pathogen, the banana plantlets cultivar Grande Naine (AAA genome Cavendish group) were grown in the extra-radical mycelium network of the AMF, arising from Medicago truncatula plantlets, for fungal root colonization. Results and discussion. At the time of infection with M. fijiensis, the AMF colonization of the banana plantlets was 12%, 56% and 10% for hyphae, arbuscules and spores/vesicles, respectively, and the number of spores produced in the medium was above 200. At day 21 and day 35 following infection by the pathogen, the number of extra-radical spores as well as the abundance of arbuscules in roots, were significantly higher than in the non-infected plantlets. Conversely, the severity index measured in the mycorrhizal plantlets decreased by more than 80% and 60%, respectively, 21 and 35 days after infection by the pathogen. Similarly, the area under disease progress curve, estimated at day 35, was reduced by 59% in the mycorrhizal banana plantlets as compared to the control plantlets. Whatever the treatment (mycorrhizal or non mycorrhizal plantlets in presence/absence of M. fijiensis), no significant differences were observed in plantlet dry weight, pseudostem height and diameter, and leaf area at both observation times. Conclusions. These results emphasize the complex multitrophic interactions between above and below-ground microorganisms mediated via the plant. They further suggest that AMF may decrease, at least at the early stage of infection, M. fijiensis symptoms possibly via the induction of a systemic resistance pathway. The important decrease in symptoms observed in the mycorrhizal banana plantlets suggest that these microorganisms may represent a potentially attractive option to consider in the context of an integrated control of this important disease. © Cirad / EDP Sciences 2015.

Dessert banana production worldwide is based on just a few highly productive, easy to grow and international market compatible cultivars from the Cavendish sub-group (AAA genome). However, these cultivars are hampered by pests and diseases, which has led to extensive pesticide use. New pest and disease resistant varieties that are productive enough to meet international market demand are now needed to reduce pesticide use and thus the detrimental environmental impact. Hybrid bananas bred by the CIRAD banana breeding program are resistant to many diseases, particularly Sigatoka diseases, but exhibit morphological traits and yield components which differ markedly from those of Cavendish bananas. After an analysis of traits related to plant morphology and yield in 530 banana hybrids, the effects of modifying the level of competition between bunches and suckers through sucker pruning management practices were compared on the new hybrid CIRAD 925 and on a reference variety from the Cavendish sub-group ‘Grande Naine’. Hybrids from the CIRAD banana breeding program tend to have thin stems, small bunches and a short crop cycle. Total sucker pruning until mother plant harvest significantly increased the fruit diameter, first cycle bunch weight, second cycle duration and decreased the plant size. However, the effect on bunch weight was greater for Grande Naine, while the effects on second cycle duration and pseudostem girth were greater for CIRAD 925. The level of apical dominance of the central meristem on suckers seemed to explain the varietal differences in the effects of sucker pruning management. Our results showed that traits related to plant morphology and yield components could be modified by sucker pruning management and that a tailored management of mother-plant/sucker competition could be a way to improve the suitability of new hybrids for the banana industry. © 2016

Ethnopharmacological relevance Musa acuminata, the wild species of banana is a plant of the tropical and subtropical regions. Over the past few decades, the health benefits of M. acuminata have received much attention. All parts of the plant including fruits, peel, pseudostem, corm, flowers, leaves, sap and roots have found their use in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. Literature review have indicated use of M. acuminata in the treatment of various diseases such as fever, cough, bronchitis, dysentery, allergic infections, sexually transmitted infections, and some of the non-communicable diseases. The reported pharmacological activities of M. acuminata include antioxidant, antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, hypolipidemic, anticancer, and antimicrobial especially anti-HIV activity. This review presents information on the phytochemicals and pharmacological studies to validate the traditional use of different parts of M. acuminata in various diseases and ailments. A comprehensive assessment of the biological activities of M. acuminata extracts is included and possible mechanisms and phytochemicals involved have also been correlated to provide effective intervention strategies for preventing or managing diseases. Materials and methods A literature search was performed on M. acuminata using ethnobotanical textbooks, published articles in peer-reviewed journals, local magazines, unpublished materials, and scientific databases such as Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. The Plant List, Promusa, Musalit, the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) databases were used to validate the scientific names and also provide information on the subspecies and cultivars of M. acuminata. Result and discussion The edible part of M. acuminata provides energy, vitamins and minerals. All other parts of the plant have been used in the treatment of many diseases in traditional medicine. The rich diversity of phytochemicals present in them probably contributes to their beneficial effects, and validates the role of M. acuminata plant parts used by various tribes and ethnic groups across the geographical areas of the world. Conclusion This review presents information on phytochemicals and pharmacological activities of M. acuminata plant parts. Pharmacological studies support the traditional uses of the plant, and probably validate the uses of M. acuminata by the indigenous people to treat and heal many infections and diseases. Some studies on animal models have been carried out, which also provide evidence of efficacy of the M. acuminata plant as a therapeutic agent. These observations suggest that M. acuminata plant parts possesses pluripharmacological properties, and can be used in designing potent therapeutic agents. However, individual bioactive constituent(s) from different parts of this plant need further investigations to confirm various pharmacological claims, and to explore the potential of M. acuminata in the development of drugs and use in functional foods. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd

This work focused on the morphological characterization of plantain cultivars collected in the period 2005–2014 in 280 villages across 9 provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo. These cultivars were established in two field collections at the University of Kisangani.Existing descriptors were adapted to better differentiate their variation to address better the taxonomic handicap and the synonymy handicap to improve future research on plantains.Most of the collected cultivars were French plantains (64 out of 98), followed by False Horn (23) and Horn (10) plantains. The bunch type was the main striking difference which allows the quick separation of plantain cultivars into three main types. Other striking differences within plantain were the size of the pseudostem (giant, medium-sized and small-sized) and the bunch orientation (which was generally pendulous or sub-horizontal, and rarely horizontal and erect). These three descriptors were considered as main descriptors. Other descriptors (pseudostem colour, immature fruit peel colour, fruit shape, fruit apex, fruit position, number of hands, fruit size, number of fingers per hand and flower relicts at the fruit apex) allowed the differentiation of one cultivar from another within the same main group of bunch type, pseudostem size or bunch orientation. These descriptors are considered as secondary descriptors. Rare descriptors allowed to differentiate one cultivar from all the others in the subgroup. This approach makes the cultivar description logical and faster because it moves from general to particular characteristics, and it offers a platform for reflections on the Pan-African scale of plantain diversity © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents the morphological classification of 19 Musa species and cultivars. Fifteen morphological characters for Musa acuminata and M. balbisiana and 50 morphological characters adapted from International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plant (UPOV) codes were employed to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship between both banana species. Analyses of genetic similarity based on all of these morphological characters suggested that bananas with A-genomes were in the same cluster. Moreover, a genetic similarity coefficient of 0.36 was obtained between M. acuminata and M. balbisiana in the analysis with the 15 morphological characters for both species, and 0.47 in the analysis with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) of the 15 morphological characters suggested that PCI and PC2 together explained 78.6% of the total variance. A PCA with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that PCI explained 80.6% of the total variance, for which the main variables were pseudostem length, leaf blade length, and peduncle length. PCA of the 15 morphological characters showed that 'Pei Chiao', 'Giant Cavendish', and 'Dwarf Cavendish' were proximal in the PCA scatterplot. Notably, the PCA of 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that 'Pei Chiao' and 'Giant Cavendish' were near each other in the PCA scatterplot, suggesting that they are phylogenetically related. The PCA of M. itinerans var.formosana with 15 morphological descriptors showed that this variant is phylogenetically distant from M. acuminata and M. balbisiana accessions. In summary, the findings may contribute to the classification and breeding of banana germplasm. © 2018 Kyushu University. All rights reserved.

Background: Inflorescence dichotomy in Musa species is a rare developmental event which leads to the production of multiple bunches on a single pseudostem at fruiting. In spite of its fascinating attraction and seductive appeal, little is known about the cytogenetic basis and molecular mechanisms that could be ascribed to this phenomenon. To bridge this gap in information, an integrative approach using cytological fingerprinting and DNA ploidy level profiling (based on chromosome counting and flow cytometry) were assayed on five inflorescence dichotomous plantain varieties and a single-bunching cultivar that served as control. This was done to assess the number and behaviour of chromosomes on the one hand and single nucleotide polymorphisms identified during analysis of nucleotide variations on the other. Results: Chromosomes stained with aceto-orcein were very tiny, compact, metacentric and acrocentric, and differed both in number and ploidy level between the inflorescence dichotomous and single-bunching cultivars. The dichotomous plantains were mainly diploid (2n = 2x = 22) while the single-bunching 'Agbagba' cultivar was consistently a triploid (2n = 3x = 33), as revealed by histological chromosome counting and flow cytometry, implying that there was a high incidence of genomic divergence on account of ploidy variations among the different Musa cultivars. Molecular genotyping using single nucleotide polymorphisms detected on the GTPase-protein binding gene of the leaf tissue gene complex provided further evidence indicating that differences in the number of bunches among the inflorescence dichotomous cultivars could be ascribed to nucleotide diversity that was elicited by changes in amino acid sequences in the genome of the crops. Non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions resulted mainly from transversion (from purine to pyramidine and vice versa), tacitly implying that these changes were crucial and promoted a cascade of reactions in the genome that were, probably, responsible for the non-persistence of the dichotomization event(s) or the reversals in the bunch phenotype detected among the inflorescence dichotomous cultivars. Conclusions: This is the first report of cytogenetic fingerprints and nucleotide diversity detection among single- and multiple-bunching Musa cultivars. A clear distinction between the two groups was found that is indicative of variations both in ploidy level and nucleotide sequences. The pattern of single nucleotide polymorphisms provided profound clues suggesting that there was a high incidence of genomic divergence, due to random and unstable genetic events that were triggered by frequent spontaneous somatic mutations. © 2019 The Author(s).

Plantain (Musa spp. AAB genome) is a major staple with an incredibly enormous potential for domestic and global trade that can serve as a vital source of income for many developing countries. The fruits are extraordinarily significant, providing an important and cheap source of dietary energy, vitamins, and several essential minerals to millions of consumers within the humid and sub-humid tropics. As molecular characterization is important for sustainable exploitation of crops, the extent of genetic and agro-morphological differentiation in a large Musa population of 109 accessions was evaluated using 10 microsatellite (SSR) markers and 14 morphotaxonomic descriptors, as a basis for selection of high yielding varieties. Measurement of DNA diversity delineated the plantains into 2 major groups and 8 distinct clusters, each with several sub-clusters. There was equally a very wide diversity detected in morphotaxonomic traits including pseudostem girth, number of bunches per plant, number of hands per bunch, number of fruits per bunch, number of fruits per hand, bunch weight, length of plant cycle, and flowering to harvest interval, which varied significantly (p < 0.05) amongst the accessions. Selection based on cluster analysis using standard morphological data also delineated the cultivars into 8 distinct clusters, with one of these containing samples that were most distant to all others and exhibited a 'double bunching' phenotype at fruiting; tacitly implying the presence of significant variability that symbolizes an excellent opportunity to bring about genetic improvement through selection of improved varieties. Principal component analysis based on morphotaxonomic traits revealed 7 attributes which contributed to 79.95% of total variation that was quite similar to the 71.87% detected using microsatellite fingerprinting. Correlation analysis between selected agronomic traits demonstrated that pseudostem girth was positively associated with bunch weight, number of hands per bunch, number of fruits per bunch, number of fruits per hand, and flowering to harvest interval across all accessions. Collectively, the data in this study suggest that plantain accessions with very unique traits expressing paramount horticultural significance are available within the diverse germplasm evaluated and are currently being collected for future breeding purposes to broaden the genetic base of this important crop. © 2020, Prof. H.S.

Bananas and plantains are important staple crops for many people in developing countries, but these crops are severely affected by biotic constraints that reduce productivity. A major biotic stress is the banana corm borer weevil (C. sordidus) whose larvae eat corm/pseudostem tissues that eventually weaken the plants and cause toppling.To manage these borer weevils, most farmers use synthetic pesticides with active ingredients from different pesticide groups. Over reliance and abusive use of pesticides result in detrimental effects on the environment and human health.These effects together with ecological backlashes such as development of resistance by the pest have led to numerous advocacies to minimize the use of these chemicals. To achieve this, there has been increasing number of researches to seek sustainable alternatives that could be used to replace these synthetic pesticides or be integrated with less toxic chemicals to effectively manage the pest. This review summarizes global research on the use of synthetic pesticides and alternative management techniques such as the use of appropriate cultural practices (e.g., clean planting materials,fallowing,mulching,intercropping,and trapping),botanical pesticides (e.g.,from Solanaceae, Asteraceae, and Meliaceae), entomopathogens, predators/parasitoids, and the use of resistant crop varieties, as well as possibilities of engineering phytocystatins to produce transgenic varieties that will be harmful to weevil.The review ends with conclusions, limitations/gaps, and recommendations for future research for the different alternative options. © CAB International 2020.

Protected cultivation (in greenhouses) is an effective cropping system to produce bananas in Turkey and much more profitable than open-field conditions. ‘Grand Nain’ is the most popular cultivar grown in greenhouses in Turkey, but it may be possible to increase yield and fruit quality, and subsequently grower incomes, by testing new cultivars. The objective of this study was to evaluate in subtropical conditions the performance of five new Cavendish cultivars (‘CV 902’, ‘Jobo, MA13’, ‘Williams’ and ‘MA13’) previously selected in open-field tropical conditions, compared to ‘Grand Nain’ (control). All new Cavendish cultivars were introduced in Turkey from VITROPIC SA, France. All cultivars were produced by in vitro micropropagation of meristems, and then deflasked and grown in nurseries to 25 cm for planting. The trials were undertaken in three different locations (Alanya, Anamur and Bozyazı, Turkey) in greenhouses. Various parameters were recorded over two crop cycles including: stem circumference, stem height, total leaf number, bunch stem circumference, number of hands and finger per bunch, finger length and circumference at harvest and bunch weight. The Bozyazı location showed better performance in many aspects of plant growth compared to the other two sites. ‘Williams’ had on average the highest pseudostem circumference and height but also the highest bunch weight (50.27 kg). The bunch weight of ‘MA13’ and ‘CV 902’ was 47.65 and 42.66 kg, respectively, whereas the control (‘Grand Nain’) and ‘Jobo’ had a lower bunch weight. ‘Williams’, ‘MA13’ and ‘CV 902’ were more productive than ‘Grand Nain’ in greenhouse conditions. In addition, no somaclonal variations were observed in any of the three experimental locations. These results suggest that the new selections have potential to provide higher yields in Turkey in protected cultivation, providing higher returns to growers, compared to local selections. © 2020 International Society for Horticultural Science.

The present cultivated enset (Ensete ventricosum) clonal landraces in Ethiopia originated from few wild progenitors. However, enset has a mixed mode of reproduction in which, the wild enset reproduces sexually through seeds, while cultivated enset is generally propagated vegetatively. The objectives of this study were to determine the genetic structure of enset cultivars through genetic analysis of qualitative morphological traits and estimate their genetic variability by evaluating the quantitative agronomic traits data generated from progenies of cultivated and wild enset genotypes. Hence, seeds collected from six cultivated and four wild enset genotypes were used for this study. Data on four qualitative and six quantitative morphological traits were recorded from the progenies of the 10 enset genotypes. Progenies of seven enset genotypes segregated in a 3:1 segregation ratio while progenies of the remaining genotypes segregated differently for the qualitative traits considered. With regard to the quantitative traits, the progenies of the 10 enset genotypes differed significantly for five of the six traits except pseudostem length. The cultivated clones, in general performed better than that of the wild types. Moderate heritability (h2b) estimates and high genetic advances were obtained for leaf length (0.38, 62.0%), pseudostem circumference (0.35, 78.5%), and plant height (0.30, 19.1%) indicating selection for these traits indirectly improves economic yield of enset clones. This study demonstrated the possibility of creating genetic variation through selfing the existing enset genotypes for traits of interest and making improvements either through selection or crossing the elite types to develop novel enset cultivars. © 2021 Indonesian Journal of Agricultural Science.

The present study identified the different abaca (Musa textilis Nee) cultivars grown in the 34 identified abaca producing barangays of Madalag and Libacao, Aklan, Philippines, and evaluated the morphological characteristics of the matured abaca plant such as plant height, number of suckers, number of leaves, the circumference of pseudostem and length of stalks. Stratified random sampling was conducted. From the two municipalities, there were 34 abaca-producing barangays identified, and three abaca plantations were randomly selected to obtain the morphological characteristics of the different abaca cultivars using the prescribed measurement procedures. Distribution of the cultivars determined through geospatial mapping using Geographic Information System (GIS). Statistical analyses employed were single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) and T-test to determine significant differences among groups/cultivars at α = 0.05 level of significance. The findings showed that there were four identified abaca cultivars commonly grown in Madalag and Libacao. These were Bisaya, Tabukanon, Agbayanon and Negro cultivars. Moreover, the morphological performance of the different cultivars responded differently. The study will provide relevant data on the distribution and morphological characteristics of abaca cultivars in the province. It could enhance programs and interventions in achieving the local and global demand for high-quality abaca fiber. © 2022 by authors.

Morphological traits are routinely used to characterize the banana varieties but are unable to precisely discriminate the closely resembling ones. Current study explores the five common banana varieties using 41 qualitative traits and discriminating traits are shortlisted based on uniformity within variety (zero Shannon index), differences between varieties (varying mode scores across varieties and significant binomial distribution of mode class from non-mode class). Five traits at vegetative stage (leaf habit, leaf blotch color, color of midrib leaf dorsal surface, petiole canal area, and pigment under pseudostem) are useful as unique descriptors for quick discrimination of five banana varieties at 62.5–100% accuracy levels. © 2021, The National Academy of Sciences, India.

Banana (Musa spp.) is a major semi-perennial fruit crop in Sri Lanka. A study was conducted at the Regional Agricultural Research and Development Centre, Angunakolapelessa to investigate the effect of age on growth and yield of banana cv Mysore ("Embul", AAB group). Thirty-seven "Embul" banana accessions collected from various ecological regions of Sri Lanka were studied in a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replicates. The observations were recorded in three consecutive years. Number of leaves per clump, LAI (leaf area index) and penetration of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to the crop were recorded at 4, 9, 20 and 32 months after planting. Pseudostem height and girth of the crop were investigated at different ages. Number of combs and fruits per comb, fruit maturity period, bunch weight, total fruit weight, average fruit weight and peduncle weight were also measured. Comb weight, fruit circumference, fruit length and diameter were recorded in the second and last combs. Leaf number and LAI increased, while penetration of PAR decreased with the age. Except weight of second comb, fruit length in second comb and fruit diameter in last comb, all other characteristics varied significantly with age of the crop. Fruit maturity period increased with the age of the crop to second year and then decreased, while total fruit weight decreased up to second year and then increased. Number of fruits per comb and bunch weight significantly increased after the second year. Stem height and girth, number of fruits per bunch, weight of the peduncle and length of the male axis consistently increased with the age of the crop investigated up to the third year.

The influence of windbreak shading was investigated over the plant crop (P) and first ratoon (R1) cycle of bananas cv. Dwarf Cavendish, to quantify its effects on assimilation, phenology and yield in the subtropics. Plants growing under seasonal windbreak shading (late autumn to early spring) were compared with those growing under full sun but under similar windbreak protection. Windbreak shading reduced average photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) by 69%, which in turn reduced photosynthesis rate by 27%, transpiration rate by 38% and stomatal conductance by 40% compared with plants growing in full sun. Pseudostem temperature was 2.1 K lower on plants growing in shade. This led to a reduction in monthly leaf emergence rate and an extended cycle time. An additional extension to cycle time was caused by the extra 3.4 leaves produced before flowering on plants growing under windbreak shading. The decreased photosynthesis of leaves growing in shade was partially compensated for in the P cycle by an extended flowering to harvest interval, resulting in no loss of bunch mass. However, bunch mass was significantly reduced in the R1 cycle, when flower to harvest intervals were similar. The most significant effect of windbreak shading was therefore a cumulative 10.6% extension in cycle time over the two crop cycles. The effect of a longer cycle and reduced bunch mass in the R1, caused by windbreak shading, resulted in an overall reduction of 13% in annual yield per ha, compared with plants growing in full sun.

The distribution of roots in banana was determined on a sandy clay loam in Costa Rica. Samples were taken from soil blocks at distances of 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm from the pseudostem, 0 to 120 cm depth at intervals of 15 cm, and from plants that were 120, 150, 180 or 210 cm tall (non-flowering), plus a set from plants with emergent flower stalks. Plant height and the horizontal distance from the pseudostem did not affect the percentage of fresh root weight. In contrast, there was a significant effect of soil depth, and a significant interaction between soil depth x horizontal distance from the pseudostem, on the percentage of fresh root weight. For the three distances from the pseudostem, the percentage of root weight decreased sharply with soil depth. Independently of the distance from the pseudostem, all plants showed the highest root weight in the top 15 cm of soil. More than 65% of the total root weight was found in the upper 30 cm of soil. More than 79% and 88% of the roots were detected in the first 45 and 60 cm of the soil profile at any plant height, respectively. The total fresh root weight in the excavated area (0-90 cm from the pseudostem and 0-120 cm depth) was 1.16, 0.97, 1.14, 1.50, and 1.22 kg in the plant heights of 120, 150, 180 and 210 cm, and plants with emergent flower stalks, respectively. Additional studies of root stratification patterns are necessary for a better understanding of the interaction between cultural practices and crop yield.

A two year trial was set up to test the viability of single-cycle cultivation using hardened vitro plants of Grande Naine (pseudostem height =45 cm and =4.5 cm thickness), at a spacing of 5.0 m x 2.5 m with 3 plants per hole (2,400 plants/ha). Twelve months after the beginning of the trial, a new planting was inserted between the existing plants, with the same spatial arrangement. The first crop was harvested 14 months after planting and the second 12 months later, thus effectively obtaining an annual crop; yields were 73.1 ton/ha and 77.7 ton/ha, respectively, with more of 90% of the fruit qualified as Extra. A comparative study of harvest date and yield was made between the three plants of each hole. Results showed significant differences due to orientation although absolute differences were slight.

The effect of three spacings on plant growth, yield and cycle duration of 'Nanicao' Cavendish banana was studied in an alluvium soil, in Guaramirim, North Coast of Santa Catarina State, Brazil. Spacings of 2.0 x 3.0, 2.0 x 2.5 and 2.0 x 2.0 meters were tested, with one follower per cycle. The increase in plant density, practically, did not affected the final development in the two first cycles, but reduced both the pseudostem perimeter from the second ratoon cycle and plant height from the fourth ratoon cycle on. The strong density effect on the yield per cycle, verified in the plant crop and first ratoon cycles, became unimportant from the second ratoon cycle on, due to less bunch weight in higher densities in these cycles. The increase in the density led to a longer crop cycle, mainly from the first ratoon cycle on. In this way, the total yield over a 98-month period tends to the balance among the treatments.

Plant height and the horizontal distance from the pseudostem did not affect the percentage of fresh root weight. In contrast, there was a significant (P= 0.0001) effect of soil depth, and also a significant (P= 0.0006) interaction between soil depth and horizontal distance from the pseudostem, on the percentage of fresh root weight. For the three distances from the pseudostem, the percentage of root weight decreased sharply with soil depths. Independently of the distance from the pseudostem, all plants showed the highest root weight in the top 15 cm of the soil (40.1%). Above 65.1% of the total root weight was found in the upper 30 cm of the soil. More than 79.4% and 88.1% of the roots were detected in the first 45 and 60 cm of the soil profile at any plant height, respectively.

Mass propagation of bananas through in vitro techniques can lead to a high percentage of non-true-to-type (somaclonal variants) plants. Variation has been found for: plant height, leaf shape and colour, pseudostem morphology and colour, reproductive organs morphology and sucker emission rate. Some of these somaclonal variants, such as the extra-dwarf or variegated types, might be interesting for their use in landscaping or for indoor pot cultivation. Growth regulators could be used to modify the growth habits of banana plants for ornamental purposes.

Plantain (Musa spp. AAB, French, cv. Essong) was grown on an acid ultisol in southern Cameroon to determine yield response to (1) a hot-water treatment to control nematodes and (2) the application of fertilizer. Observations were made for 42 months. Establishment was unaffected by hot-water treatment or fertilizer. Hot-water treatment reduced nematode infestation to about 30% of that found in untreated plants and increased rhizome survival by 11%. Fertilizer application increased the proportion of bunch-producing plants from 44 to 65% through reduced die-back, toppling and pseudostem breakage during the dry season but had no effect on bunch weight per plant. Fresh bunch yield of the plant-crop was 10.2 Mg ha-1 in unfertilized, untreated, plots; fertilized plots produced 15.3 Mg ha-1 and hot-water treated plots 13 Mg ha-1. Fertilized and hot-water treated plots produced 20.8 Mg ha-1. First ratoon yields were unaffected by fertilizer, but increased due to hot-water treatment from 0.81 to 5.0 Mg ha-1. Plant-crop bunch weight decreased with increasing time between planting and harvest. Mean bunch fresh weight was negatively correlated with an index of root nematode infestation and positively correlated with the number of living roots. For the plant-crop and plant-crop plus ratoon yields, the yield increase due to combined use of fertilizer and hot-water treatment was larger than increases attained by individual measures. Thus combination of hot-water treatment and fertilizer had a synergistic effect on plantain fresh bunch yield, justifying introduction of both measures simultaneously.

An experiment was carried out at the Mohanpur, during 1997 and 1998 to assess the impact of retaining parent pseudostem at different height (s) on growth and yield of first ratoon sucker(s) severed/non-severed with the parent pseudostem in dwarf cavendish banana (Musa, AAA) cultivar. Giant Governor. Retention of untopped parent pseudostem gave maximum height and girth of the connected/non-severed suckers compared with the retention of parent pseudostem cut at mid height and corm level. Leaf size and total leaf production were markedly increased while bunch emergence was delayed in the connected/non-severed suckers by retaining untopped parent pseudostem. Retention of single sucker connected/non-severed with the untopped parent pseudostem exhibited highest finger weight and yield/plant over the severed suckers and parent pseudostem cut at mid height and corm revel. But the fruit yield/ha was recorded highest with retention of two suckers connected/non-severed with untopped parent pseudostem.

To compare the mineral nutrition of organically and normally grown banana plants, observations were made on growth and yield of organic banana plants, at the Canary Islands. The data were then discussed opposite the results previously reported for conventional plantations. Materials and methods. Growth parameters (plant height, leaf emission rate, pseudostem circumference) and yield parameters (bunch weight, number of hands, finger grade, etc.) were measured during ten months on an organically grown banana plantation of Dwarf Cavendish cv. Leaf N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn contents were also assessed. Results and discussion. Leaf emission rates showed higher values in late spring and early summer (0.099-0.109 leaf.d-1), while pseudostem circumference grew more in late spring (0.238 cm.d-1) than in summer. In August, pseudostem circumference decreased dramatically, probably because the plants with a larger circumference had flowered before that month and could not be measured. Bunches gave good yields for the zone (43.59 kg on average) and had a high mean number of hands (12.79). Number of fingers of the second upper hand (25.63), their grade (37.63 cm), length (23.50 cm) and weight (165.19 g) ranged from normal to high. Month of harvesting influenced yield and quality of the fruits. Leaf content of N, P, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn fell within the normal range related to the conventionally grown banana plants. Potassium foliar content showed low levels but not deficiencies, whereas Ca leaf concentrations were high but not excessive. No relationship was found among leaf nutrient levels and growth, yield and fruit quality parameters. © 2001 Cirad/EDP Sciences.

Introduction. A study was done to compare Gruesa, a local dwarf Cavendish selection, with two other cultivars of the Cavendish subgroup in the open air or under greenhouse conditions in two localities of the Canary Islands. Materials and methods. The trials were set up with the cultivars Zelig, Grande Naine and Gruesa in four plots on the northern slope: one outdoors and three under three different greenhouse covers (one with polyethylene lamina and the other two with different types of mesh), and in one outdoor plot on the southern slope of the island of Tenerife. Morphological, phenological and production characteristics were studied over three productive cycles. Results. Significant differences were found in both plant height (Grande Naine > Zelig > Gruesa) and pseudostem thickness (Gruesa > Grande Naine = Zelig). Each cultivar showed a stable [height:thickness] ratio, remaining the same in all trial conditions. Gruesa cycle length was longer than those of the other two cultivars, emitting more leaves until bunch emergency. Gruesa produced the most hands per bunch and the most fingers per hand. In all cultivars, finger length was directly related to pseudostem height. All three cultivars produced well, with fruits very similar in organoleptic traits. A reduction in cycle length and a slight increase in productivity were observed in the northern plot under the polyethylene cover compared with the plots under other covers and outdoors. Conclusion. Gruesa appears more recommendable than Zelig and Grande Naine for open-air plantations in windy localities. © 2005 Cirad/EDP Sciences. All rights reserved.

Sterility has profound effects on the development of reproductive tissues in members of the Musaceae and limits genetic improvement required to deal with new diseases. Ovules of seeded diploid Musa acuminata (AA) and edible triploids (AAA) from the same cytogenetic group, plus edible triploids containing genomes of the M. balbisiana cytogenetic group (AAB, ABB) and the related genus Ensete sp. were studied to determine the effects of sterility on the growth and development of the ovule and its tissues. Specimens were collected from subtropical and Mediterranean environments in Australia. At anthesis, the ovules of triploid plants were 36% larger than the ovules of diploid plants. The diploid ovules ceased growth shortly after the inflorescence emerged from the pseudostem. In contrast, the triploid ovules continued to grow 7-10 days past anthesis, increasing in size by 70%. All ovules of diploid M. acuminata ssp. had an embryo sac at anthesis, against 97% for triploids. At anthesis the embryo sacs in diploid ovules occupied 2.7% of the nucellus compared with 1.5% in triploid ovules. The embryo sacs did not grow between bunch emergence and anthesis, once formed they maintained the same size. Many embryo sacs were not positioned correctly, flush with the nucellar cap. The diploid M. acuminata ssp. had 75% of embryo sacs correctly positioned against 10% in the edible triploids. The proportion of balbisiana genome (B) did not affect ovule or nucellus size or shape, or cell number across the nucellus. It increased the embryo sac presence 96-100% of ovules. The sterile edible triploid bananas have embryo sacs at anthesis but many are incorrectly positioned, which may contribute to their sterility. The balbisiana genome in the edible triploids was associated with a 2.4-fold increase in the number of correctly positioned embryo sacs and this may contribute to the increased fertility associated with the B genome. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of weed management on banana (Musa AAA cv. Grande Naine) parasitic nematodes was evaluated under Costa Rican field conditions with special reference to their spatial distribution and the damage caused to roots of different thickness classes and their relation to yield losses. Root samples were taken at plant harvest, from soil blocks at 0-30,30-60 and 60-90 cm from the pseudostem, and at every 15 cm depth, from 0 to 120 cm. Weed management neither affected the nematode numbers nor their horizontal and vertical distribution and associated root damage. Differences in Radopholus similis (P<0.0001), Helicotylenchus spp. (P=0.0115) and total nematode populations (P<0.0001) were found in roots of different thickness. The average populations in thick, thin and fine roots were for R. similis 270,666 (57%), 120,401 (25%) and 11,313 (2%); for Helicotylenchus spp. 36,094 (7%), 22,508 (5%) and 8,824 (2%); and total nematodes 390,425 (65%), 145,534 (31%) and 21,177 (4%), respectively. No linear correlations were found between bunch weight and the number and density of nematodes or with their damage. Even though, no statistical difference was found in bunch weight, the manual weed control plot yielded 1.4 kg heavier bunches, which might have important implications for sustainable agriculture. The implementation of weed control by hand chopping may improve the physical, chemical and biological soil properties and reduce soil erosion, temperature fluctuations, evaporation rate, and nutrient leaching, and increase water infiltration. As a consequence of the decrease in herbicide applications, soil and air pollution might be reduced. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The objective of this work was to characterize and evaluate the behavior of 13 banana genotypes (varieties and hybrids) AAA, AAAA, AAB and AAAB genomic groups, in two production cycles in southwest Bahia, using relevant phenotypic descriptors for the identification and selection of superior individuals. The Prata Anã and Pacovan (AAB), Grande Naine and Nanicão (AAA) varieties and the hybrids PA42-44, Pacovan Ken, Japira, Preciosa and ST12-31 (AAAB) and Ambrosia, Calipso, Bucaneiro and FHIA-02 (AAAA), selected at Embrapa Cassava and Fruit Crops, were evaluated. The experimental design was in random blocks, with 13 treatments, five repetitions, 20 plants per plot, six useful and 3.00 m x 2.00 m spacing. The following characteristics were considered: Plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of live leaves during flowering and harvest, number of days from planting to flowering and until harvest, bunch and hand weight, number of fruits, weight, length and diameter of fruit. Grande Naine, and Nanicão stood out for the characteristics of bunch and hand weight, number of fruits, fruit weight and length; the FHIA-02 hybrid presented greater fruit diameter in both production cycles and the earliest flowering and harvest in the second cycle; Calipso was the latest for harvest; ST12-31 was the tallest in height; the Prata Anã variety stood out for number of live leaves during flowering and harvest; the Prata type hybrids, PA42-44, Pacovan Ken, Preciosa and Japira, stood out for the parameters related to fruit quality when compared to its genitors Prata Anã and Pacovan, respectively; there was an increment of the parameters that reflected vegetative growth and yield from the first to the second production cycle for all genotypes evaluated.

The practices of repetitive transplanting and leaf pruning methods of enset (Ensete ventricosum) plants are not consistent over enset growing areas. Current yield levels in enset production are relatively low and vary between growing areas depending on the different repetitive transplanting and leaf pruning practices. Patterns of enset plant growth over the entire growing season and relative distribution and accumulation of dry matter to the harvestable parts of the crop as influenced by the different practices are important parameters to understand and modify the management practices in an effort to increase the yield of the plant. Influence of repetitive transplanting and leaf pruning methods on growth, dry matter partitioning and dry matter production were studied at the Areka Research Centre, North Omo, Southern Ethiopia. Transplanting treatments significantly affected height, circumference of pseudostem and dry matter yield of corm and pseudostem at all harvest dates. Increase in dry matter was earlier in once (T1) compared to twice (T2) and thrice (T3) treatments. Maximum total plant dry matter yield per unit space of T1 and T2 transplanted enset suckers was obtained at flowering at 104 and 234 weeks after first transplanting, respectively. Repetitive transplanting reduced the fitted maximum rate of increase (g m-2 week-1) compared to direct transplanting. The dry matter partitioning to the harvestable parts however, were increased as a result of repetitive transplanting. Partitioning of dry matter to the harvestable organs of the plant seems more important than total dry matter production for determining kocho yield of enset plants. For early yield, livestock feed and other purposes however direct transplanting might be practical. Leaf pruning alone or the interaction between leaf pruning and transplanting did not significantly affect dry matter production and partitioning. Circumference of the pseudostem seems a good indicator for high yield of kocho. © 2007 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

In order to identify the effect of burrowing nematodes on the shoots (pseudostem and leaves) of banana plants and to determine whether or not shoot characteristics are associated with plant resistance to nematodes two experiments were conducted in controlled conditions within polytunnels. The banana plants were harvested on three occasions for the measurement of root morphology and biomass. Varieties differed in their resistance to nematodes from resistant (Yg Km5, FHIA 17, FHIA 03) and partly resistant (FHIA 01, FHIA 25) to not resistant (FHIA 23, Williams). Nematodes reduced total plant dry weight at the first harvest in Experiment 1 and by an average of 8.8% in Experiment 2, but did not affect leaf area in either experiment. The ratio of above-ground weight to total plant weight was reduced from 75% to 72% in nematode-infected plants compared with the control plants for all varieties tested in Experiment 1, but was only reduced in FHIA 25 and FHIA 23 in Experiment 2. Varieties differed in above-ground growth. The FHIA varieties had greater shoot weights and leaf area than YgKm5 and Williams. Overall, resistance to nematodes was associated with the partitioning of a greater proportion of biomass to the roots than to above-ground parts. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

Plantain production (Musa spp.) in Central and South America and the Caribbean is affected by bacterial diseases. In Puerto Rico, production of the plantain 'Hua Moa' is affected by a condition known as bunch abortion or 'choke neck'. This condition in some cases is accompanied by soft rot symptoms and therefore could be related to phytopathogenic bacteria. The purpose of this study was to identify the bacteria related to the soft rot tissues on plants affected with the bunch abortion symptoms and determine their virulence in other clones of plantain and banana. Bacterial colonies were isolated from pseudostems of Hua Moa at three locations in Puerto Rico, using semi-selective and nutritive agar media. The pathogenicity was determined by using potato and plantain pseudostem discs in humid chambers under in vitro conditions. Pathogenic bacteria were identified by using the BIOLOG® system. Under greenhouse conditions, the virulence of Burkholderia gladioli, Pseudomonas spinosa, Erwinia chrysanthemi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was confirmed on plantain (Maricongo, FIAH-121, Enano Común, and Hua Moa) and banana (Grand Nain) using a scale from 1 to 9. All clones evaluated under greenhouse conditions were susceptible to E. chrysanthemi, potential causal agent of soft rot in Hua Moa plantain once the bunch abortion appears. Burkholderia gladioli is reported for the first time affecting plantain and banana.This bacterium was more virulent in Hua Moa and Grand Nain clones with severity of 7 and 5, respectively, than in Maricongo, severity 3. Pseudomonas spinosa and P. aeruginosa produced less damage with severity less than 4, than E. chrysanthemi and B. gladioli with severity greater than 4. This research was conducted under in vitro and greenhouse conditions and demonstrates that the most important bacteria causing soft rot in plants with the choke neck condition are E. chrysanthemi and B. gladioli. It is recommended to conduct field studies using plants up to the reproductive stage to determine whether these bacteria are also related as causal agents of the choke neck.

Field experiments were conducted in Oahu, Hawaii, to investigate the effects of banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) infection on growth and morphology of banana (Musa acuminata). The time interval between aphid inoculation of BBTV and the initial appearance of disease symptoms (i.e. incubation period) was also determined. Plants infected with BBTV showed a significant reduction in petiole size (i.e. length and distance), plant canopy and height, leaf area, pseudostem diameter and chlorophyll content compared with control plants. Growth differences between virus-infected and control plants were not observed until 40-50 days after the plants were inoculated with viruliferous aphids. Other growth parameters such as petiole width and leaf production were not statistically different between infected and control plants. The incubation period of banana bunchy top disease or appearance of symptoms ranged from 25 to 85 days after aphid inoculation. However, PCR assays provided earlier detection of BBTV in banana plants compared with visual symptoms. © 2008 The Authors.

The banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus, is the most important insect pest of banana and plantain in the world. Cultural control methods were investigated over 2 years in southern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Harvesting at ground level and dissection of remnants (treatment 1), and covering the base of the mat (entire plant consisting of several meristems) with soil and moving debris to the inter-row (treatment 2), were compared to a positive control that involved treatment of plants with a registered pesticide (treatment 3), and a negative control that involved harvesting at 150 cm from the collar with no soil or sanitation amendments (treatment 4). Yield, weevil damage and pseudostem girth of plants were measured from August to November annually, while adult beetle densities were assessed over 4 weeks in October/November and April. Nematode samples were taken and analysed in October/November every year. Damage parameters included the coefficient of infestation, the percentage coefficient of infestation (PCI) at two intervals, the summed PCI value, the percentage cross-sectional damage of the central cylinder and cortex, and the mean cross-sectional damage percentage. A randomized block design with three replicates was used in the trial. The parameters were similar before the onset of the trial. Fruit yield and plant girth, corrected by nematode densities, were not significantly different in any treatment, nor were the nematodes controlled. Soil cover and recession of remnants was the only effective treatment, significantly reducing the CI, but not the adult density or the other damage parameters. Soil cover showed promise as a cultural control method because it only needs to be applied seasonally and reduced the percentage cross-sectional damage of the central cylinder, the damage parameter most closely related to yield, by 14%. © 2008 The Authors.

The results of research on the water relations and irrigation need of banana are collated and summarised in an attempt to link fundamental studies on crop physiology to irrigation practices. Background information on the ecology of the banana and crop development processes, with emphasis on root growth and water uptake, is presented, followed by reviews of the influence of water stress on gas exchange (stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration), crop water use, and yield. Emphasis is placed on research that has international relevance and, where appropriate, three geographical areas (the tropics, subtropics and Mediterranean climates) are considered. Although roots can extend to depths of 1.0-1.5 m, the effective depth of rooting is usually taken to be 0-0.40 m, sometimes extending to 0.60 m. Stomatal conductance is a sensitive measure of soil water availability and plant water status, whilst transpiration rates can be limited by dry air (saturation deficits &gt;2.0 kPa). In the subtropics, there are seasonal differences in the crop coefficient (Kc) with values ranging from 0.6 in the winter months to about 1.0 Epan in the summer. It is difficult to draw generic conclusions with wide applicability from the irrigation experiments as they were reported. All the components of marketable yield can be enhanced by irrigation whilst applying insufficient water delays crop development. Annual yield responses to irrigation are variable, but water use efficiencies of 40 kg ha-1 mm-1 (fresh fruit/water applied) have been achieved in the tropics and subtropics (and elsewhere up to 80 kg ha-1 mm-1 with partial replacement of the soil water deficit). To ensure large yields of (marketable) fruit, soil water deficits must be kept low (Ψm &gt;-20 kPa at 0.2 m depth). In the subtropics, this means irrigation intervals should not exceed 2-3 d during the summer. The cooling effect of irrigation with micro-sprinklers on the soil and pseudostem temperatures, compared with drippers, can delay crop development and reduce annual yields by 30%. There is some (limited) evidence that the presence of the B genome contributes to drought tolerance. Yield response factors to irrigation for different growth stages have yet to be confirmed. Opportunities to improve the water productivity of the many, diverse banana cultivars need to be explored further. © Cambridge University Press 2009.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the phytotechnical behavior of 'Prata-Anã' banana and four progeny hybrids, during two production cycles, in the Perímetro Irrigado do Estreito, southwest of Bahia state, Brazil. The experimental design was completely randomized with fi ve treatments: cultivar 'Prata-Anã' and the hybrids Fhia-01 (BRS Fhia Maravilha), BRS Fhia-18, Fhia 18 and PA42-44, with ten replicates. Phenotypic vegetative descriptors, cycle length and yield were measured. Increases occurred between cycles for: plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of hands and fruits, and yield. The Fhia-18 hybrid showed greater size and pseudostem perimeter, and 'Prata-Anã' had the smallest, (with maintenance of this character in the PA42-44). The hybrids were similar in the number of suckers produced. BRS Fhia-18, PA42-44 and Fhia-1 were early for harvest and had greater fruit length than 'Prata-Anã'. Fhia-18 produced more fruit and PA42-44 had fewer hands compared to the parental cultivar. BRS Fhia-18, Fhia-18 and Fhia-1 are more productive than the parental cultivar. 'Prata-Anã' is more susceptible to yellow sigatoka, while PA42-44 is resistant, with greater retention of leaves at harvest; however, both have similar yields.

Banana, an important fruit crop, requires high amounts of N-fertilizers for commercial cultivation. This, however, is costly and can be hazardous to the soil environment when used excessively. Biofertilizer is globally accepted as an alternative source of N-fertilizer and can substantially supplement the N requirement while enhancing the uptake of water and mineral nutrients of crop plants. An experiment was conducted to observe the effect of plant growth promoting rhizobacterial inoculation on growth, nutrient uptake of bananas grown under hydroponics condition. The design of the experiment was randomized complete block with five replicates. The following six treatments were imposed: T1 (control; N0-PGPR), T2: (N0+Sp7), T3: (N0+ UPMB10), T4: (N 33%+ Sp7), T5: (N33% + UPMB10), and T 6: (N100%-PGPR). The results showed that inoculation by UPMB10 with minimal fertilizer-N supply increased (P &lt; 0.05) the primary root elongation and secondary root initiation and subsequently increased (P &lt; 0.05) the root biomass. The same treatment also increased (P &lt; 0.05) N concentration in pseudostem and leaves and Ca concentration in roots. The total accumulation of N, P, K, Ca and Mg were increased due to inoculation; a consequence of increased plant growth. Plants with this treatment produced an equivalent total dry matter as those supplied with 100% N. © 2009 Academic Journals.

Field performance of two IITA plantain hybrids ('PITA-1', 'PITA-4') were assessed at two locations in Ghana alongside two local landraces (False Horn 'Brodeyuo', Intermediate French 'Oniaba') and a hybrid cultivar 'Apem Hemaa' ('FHIA-21'). The objective of the study was to identify high yielding and disease resistant hybrids for growers in Ghana. The hybrids were evaluated for their agronomic performance and yield, tolerance to Black Sigatoka disease, number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest, crop cycle, plant height and pseudostem girth. The results showed that the hybrids were tolerant/resistant to the Black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) disease with high number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest. This characteristic of the hybrids was an important feature that could fit well into the smallholder cropping system. The crop cycles were comparable to that of 'False Horn' plantains. The yield performance of the hybrids was better compared to the landraces. The number of hands per bunch produced by the hybrids was also higher than those of the landraces except the intermediate French plantain ('Oniaba'). The finger lengths of the IITA hybrids were however shorter compared to the landraces and this could hinder their acceptance by consumers.

Nutrient potassium is critical in plantain (Musa species cv. AAB) nutrition. It plays a key role in the vegetative growth and bunch development. Application of 300 kg muriate of potash (K20) per hectare was beneficial in the plant crop, while a higher rate (400 kg K20/ha) enhanced growth and favorable yield components (number of hands and fingers/bunch, finger mass, girth and length). Plants fertilized with 400 kg K20/ha were tallest (3.5m), had largest pseudostem girth (56-58cm) with highest (11-12) number of functional leaves at flowering and attained flowering stage after 9 mouths of vegetative growth. Bunch mass, bunch yield/ha and yield components were significantly (P = 0.05) highest at 300 kg k 20/ha in plant crop and at 400 kg K20/ha in ratoon crop. Heaviest bunches were 8.8 and 9.8 kg/plant in plant and ratoon crops, respectively, giving the respective corresponding bunch yields of 14.66 and 16.33 tonnes/ha. Application of 400 kg K20/ha appeared adequate for sustainable production of false horn plantain in the high rainforest zone of Cross River State. © 2009 Trop. Agric. (Trinidad).

The objective of this work was to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of Prata banana plants during three production cycles, under different irrigation systems, in semi-arid conditions. A randomized block design was adopted with six treatments, in a 3×2 factorial arrangement: three irrigation systems - conventional sprinkler, microsprinkler and drip - and two genotypes - 'Prata-Anã' and its hybrid PA42-44. Four replicates in plots with six useful plants were used. Plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of alive leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area, and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. Weight of bunch and hands, mean weight of hands, weight of the three first hands, number of hands and fruits per bunches, and weight, length and diameter of fruits and number of alive leaves were evaluated during the harvest season. The drip irrigation system provides smaller vigor to banana Prata, in comparison to conventional and to micro sprinkler systems, as can be seen by the size and perimeter of the pseudostem. The cultivar Prata-Anã shows a larger number of fruit and hands per brunch, while its hybrid PA42-44 shows larger weight, length and fruit diameter.

Musa spp. is one of the most important fruit crops in the world. Production in Mexico is ranked in the eighth place in the world. Nutrient imbalance is one of the main agronomic problems this species has to deal with. Modern fertilization programs must be designed based on nutrient demand by the cultivated plants, and according to their phenological phase. However, no information is available for 'Dominico', one of the most widespread cultivars in Mexico. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate dry mass and macronutrient accumulation and distribution in banana 'Dominico' during the fruit development phase. This is to determine the amount and timing of fertilizer application. Adult plants were randomly selected in a banana orchard established in Atzalán, Veracruz, México. Root, corm, pseudostem, leaves with petiole, and the bunch were sampled at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after inflorescence emergence (WAIE) on these plants. Samples were processed, and biomass accumulation and N, P, K, Ca, and Mg concentration were determined. Pseudostem was the plant part with the highest dry mass and nutrient accumulation. Potassium was the most extracted nutrient by the plant and the fruit. The sequence for total nutrient extraction per plant was: K > Ca > N > Mg > P. Fruit extraction sequence was: K>N>Ca≥P≥Mg. The highest nutrient extraction was detected at 4 WAIE. The quantity of mineral nutrients that would have to be replenished into the soil will be those extracted by the bunches because they are removed from the plantation. It is recommended that fertilizer applications be split up to the 2 WAIE. This is to guarantee nutrient supply by the 4 WAIE so that an optimum fruit and daughter plant development could be achieved.

The physicochemical properties of plantain (Musa paradisiaca) and banana (Musa sapientum) pseudostem wastes have been determined. It was found that the average moisture content for both samples were very high while the concentrations of solubles in both cold and hot water were moderate, the concentrations of the solubles of the pulverized pseudostems in 1:2v/v ethanol-benzene solution mixture were higher than those of 18% NaOH. The mineral elements detected in the leaf-fold and the core of both Musa paradisiaca and Musa sapientum pseudostem wastes were Na, K, Cr, Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu, and P. Pb was present in trace concentrations in only the banana leaf-folds. The phytochemical composition in mg/100g for the plantain and banana pseudostem wastes were: oxalates (66.28±2.01, 41.56±2.55); phytates (3.78±0.05, 3.23±0.33); tannins (7.99±0.26, 6.55±0.33); and cyanogenic glycosides (1.47±0.14, 1.44±0.33) respectively. Flavonoids, saponins and alkaloids were present in both varieties, but steroids were absent. The values of lignin ranged between 2.28 and 7.30% pseudostems, the carbohydrate between 39.71 and 62.21 mg/100g for plantain and 42.13 and 93.82 mg/100g for banana pseudostems while the pentosan content for both ranged between 6.67 and 11.73 mg/100g. Generally, plantain, pseudostems waste contains higher values of the phytochemicals than the banana pseudostems except the pentosen content; both contain high amount of carbohydrate which can be exploited for the preparation of pulp for paper making and for production of cellulose derivatives and sugar.

The present study was conducted in two successive seasons (2009/2010 and 2010/2011) on the first and second ratoons of Williams banana plants cultivated in loamy clay soil under flood irrigation at a private orchard located at Tanta, Gharbia Governorate, Egypt. Four planting densities (ranged from 933 to 1400 plants feddan-1) were examined to study their effect on vegetative growth, flowering, yield and fruit quality of Williams banana. Banana plants grown at close spacing had taller pseudostem than plants grown under wide spacing. The highest yield per feddan was obtained from plants spaced at 3×2 in with two plants per hole, followed by those at 3×1 in, with one plant per hole since it was 34.07 and 30.33 tons in the first ratoon and 34.80 and 31.50 in the second ratoon for both planting distances, respectively. Earliest bunch shooting and minimum days for harvesting were recorded with planting distance 3×4 in with three plants per hole and bunch emerged earlier (12-13 days) than bunches produced from plants spaced at 3×1 in with one plants per hole in both first and second ratoons, respectively. Heaviest bunches were harvested from plants at 3×4 in spacing with three plants per hole. Increasing yield per feddan by this planting distance could be attributed mainly to the increasing number of plants in the area unit. The highest finger weight, length, Total Soluble Solids (TSS%) and total sugars% were produced from plant spaced at 3×4 in with three plants per hole. © 2012 Academic Journals Inc.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the response of irrigated 'Prata Anã' banana (AAB) to soil application of phosphorus, in four production cycles. The experiment was carried out in the semiarid region of the north of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in a clayey Oxisol, with very low available P (4.6 mg dm-3, Mehlich). A randomized complete block design was used, in a 5x4 factorial arrangement, with five doses of triple superphosphate (0, 50, 100, 200, and 300 g P2O5 per plant per year), four production cycles, and four replicates. In the first cycle, the soil application of P increased plant height, pseudostem diameter, weight and number of fruits per bunch of banana; however, banana plants did not respond to P application in the second, third, and fourth cycles. 'Prata Anã' banana, even when grown in soil with low P content, responds to the application of this nutrient only in the first production cycle.

The need for more efficient nutrient use in adverse conditions, such as droughts, facilitated the development of new alternatives for fertilizer application, such as direct insertion into the vascular system of the pseudostem of harvested banana plants (Musa AAA Simmonds), considering the plant interconnection between the mother plant and the sucker in succession. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of fertilizer insertion into the pseudostem of banana plants compared to the conventional soil fertilization system. The study was conducted at two locations (north and center of Urabá region), setting different rates of fertilizer treatments (75, 100 and 125% of the commercial rate) inserted at different heights (0.6 m and 0.9 m) with a soil application of fertilizers as a control treatment. Biometric (height, pseudostem diameter, number of leaves), physiological (specific leaf area and specific leaf weight), and production variables were evaluated in the plants. According to the results, it was evident that the 0.9 m insertion height of the fertilizer was better than 0.6 m and the soil application. Although no significant differences were found between doses of fertilizer, we observed a trend of better performance for plants in treatments of 75% and 100% fertilizer dose inserted at 0.9 m.

The effects of chicken manure as a soil amendment and the application of nematicides on plant characteristics, yield and foliar nutrient content of the African Rhino plantain clone were evaluated. Chemical properties of the soil were monitored after chicken manure application. Chicken manure, at a rate of 25 t/ha, was incorporated during soil preparation. The nematicide treatment included the use of etoprop at planting, followed by oxamyl at six and 12 months after planting. The application of chicken manure significantly increased the height and diameter of the pseudostem, reduced the number of days from planting to shooting, and increased bunch weight, and yield per hectare. With the use of chicken manure a yield of 34,242 kg/ha was obtained. This yield represents a 33% increase over that of the treatment without chicken manure. The use of nematicides significantly diminished the number of collapsed plants and increased plantain yield. The use of chicken manure increased the foliar content of N and Ca whereas the use of nematicide had no effect on any of the nutrient foliar content. The chemical properties of the soil (pH; organic matter; electric conductivity; N, P, K, Ca and Mg content) were not affected by the use of chicken manure.

Banana genotypes grown under different irrigation systems may express different vegetative traits and yields, even if all other crop conditions are similar. This study aimed to evaluate the vegetative traits of two banana genotypes of the Pome subgroup (AAB) under different irrigation systems in semiarid conditions during three production cycles. The experimental design was a randomized block design with six treatments in a 3×2 factorial scheme: three irrigation systems (sprinkler, micro-sprinkler and drip) and two genotypes ('Dwarf Pome' and 'BRS Platina', earlier reported as 'PA42-44'). Four replications were used, with six plants spaced at 3.0×2.5 m per net plot. Plant height, pseudostem girth, number of functional leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. In addition the number of functional leaves, weight of bunch and number of hands was also evaluated at harvest. Interactions between the treatments were not significant. Irrigation systems affected vegetative traits. The drip irrigation system reduced growth as measured by plant height and pseudostem girth, for both genotypes, compared with conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems. The weight of the bunch in the second cycle and the number of hands in the third cycle were higher for plants grown under conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems compared to drip irrigation. The 'Dwarf Pome' showed higher number of hands per bunch than 'BRS Platina'.

'Namwa' (ABB) banana found in Thailand and Southeast Asia is composed of many related cultivars. With their versatile utilization, understanding their development and fruit ×uality leads to the appropriate production and management. This research aimed to investigate their growth and yield from eight clones including 'Namwa Pak Chong 50' (PC50), 'Namwa Mali Ong' (ML), 'Namwa Tanao Si' (TNS), 'Namwa Ngoen' (NWN), 'Namwa Khom' (NWK), 'Nam Vo' (NV), 'Namwa Thong Ma Eng' (TME) and 'Namwa Dam' (NWD). The field trial was conducted at Pak Chong Research Station from January 2010 to June 2011 with Randomized Complete Block Design. The data revealed that NV produced the tallest pseudostem of 4.1 m but NWK the shortest at 2.7 m while the rest were 3.7-4.0 m tall. PC50 and TME needed the shortest vegetative period, taking only 37-38 weeks from planting to flower bud emergence, while the others took 40-44 weeks. TME, NWD and NWC took 14-20 days for flowering (bract opening period) whereas the rest 21-24 days. All cultivars could be harvested for fruit by 58-60 weeks after planting except for TNS and NWD at 62-64 weeks. NWK yielded the highest in bunch weight at 31 kg followed by NWN, NV and TME (28 kg) while the others at 19-25 kg. This resulted in the highest hands/bunch (12.4) and fingers/bunch (241) for NWC while 9.4-10.2 hands/bunch and 150-170 fingers/bunch for others. NV provided the largest mature green finger while NWK and TNS the smallest. The pedicel length and peel thickness varied from cultivar to cultivar. All cultivars at ripe stage had pulp total soluble solids at about 25.5-27.5% with pulp firmness at 1.57-2.06 N cm-2 which was not significantly different among the cultivars. The results suggested that the cultivar members in the 'Namwa' group are different in their plant performance and produce. This possibly leads to their different utilization.

Tissue culture plantlets were superior than conventional suckers in terms of yield and income with better growth and yield parameters. The highest pseudostem height (219.76 cm), pseudostem girth (73.95 cm), number of suckers (8.75), number of leaves (23.37), leaf length (187.76 cm), leaf breadth (53.80 cm), leaf area (1.01 m2), and yield attributes like bunch length (81.25 cm), bunch diameter (36.24 cm), bunch weight (25.38 kg), hands per bunch (25.38), fingers per bunch (156.13), finger length (16.13 cm), finger diameter (3.61 cm) and finger weight (330.88 g) were also significantly higher in tissue culture plants than the sucker grown plants. The lengthened phyllocron (15.11 days), days taken to shooting (372.25 days) and shooting to maturity (108.50 days) was noted in plantation raised with conventiontional sucker. Tissue culture crop yielded 63.44 t/ha, which was 39.43% higher than the yield of conventional sucker (45.50 t/ha) grown crop and as a result crop grown with tissue culture plantlets had a benefit cost ratio of 2.25 as compared to 1.65 of crop grown with conventional suckers. The farmers of Terai zone of West Bengal can establish their banana plantation using tissue culture plantlets of banana cv. Grand Naine, if available or otherwise can be done through suckers.

Dessert banana production worldwide is based on just a few highly productive, easy to grow and international market compatible cultivars from the Cavendish sub-group (AAA genome). However, these cultivars are hampered by pests and diseases, which has led to extensive pesticide use. New pest and disease resistant varieties that are productive enough to meet international market demand are now needed to reduce pesticide use and thus the detrimental environmental impact. Hybrid bananas bred by the CIRAD banana breeding program are resistant to many diseases, particularly Sigatoka diseases, but exhibit morphological traits and yield components which differ markedly from those of Cavendish bananas. After an analysis of traits related to plant morphology and yield in 530 banana hybrids, the effects of modifying the level of competition between bunches and suckers through sucker pruning management practices were compared on the new hybrid CIRAD 925 and on a reference variety from the Cavendish sub-group ‘Grande Naine’. Hybrids from the CIRAD banana breeding program tend to have thin stems, small bunches and a short crop cycle. Total sucker pruning until mother plant harvest significantly increased the fruit diameter, first cycle bunch weight, second cycle duration and decreased the plant size. However, the effect on bunch weight was greater for Grande Naine, while the effects on second cycle duration and pseudostem girth were greater for CIRAD 925. The level of apical dominance of the central meristem on suckers seemed to explain the varietal differences in the effects of sucker pruning management. Our results showed that traits related to plant morphology and yield components could be modified by sucker pruning management and that a tailored management of mother-plant/sucker competition could be a way to improve the suitability of new hybrids for the banana industry. © 2016

An experiment was conducted at Bukit Perawas Ayer Lanas, Jeli Kelantan from December 2014 to April 2015 to study the effect of different rates of foliar fertiliser at vegetative stage for banana cultivation. Four levels of foliar fertiliser (0 ml L-1 [control], 1 ml L-1, 2 ml L-1 and 3 ml L-1) were applied monthly throughout the experimental period. Inorganic foliar fertiliser formulation HI-NKTM, a product of ACM Sdn. Bhd, was used. It consisted of 16:8:16 of NPK and a few trace elements Fe, Mn, Mo, Cu, Zn, B and Mo. Data on growth parameters such as pseudostem height, pseudostem girth and leaf area were recorded for the first 16 weeks of planting. A logistic growth model was used to predict the response of the banana plant to foliar fertiliser (from the 16th week to the 24th week of planting). The highest vegetative growth (pseudostem height, pseudostem girth and leaf area) was yielded by the treatment that used foliar fertiliser was applied at 1 ml L-1. The earliest results of plant growth response for treatment A, B and C could be seen in the second week of planting. The treatments followed the logistic growth curve in R2 ranging from 0.92 to 0.96. The pseudostem height, pseudostem girth and leaf area of the banana plants applied with 1 ml L-1 at the 16th week of planting were 59.87 cm, 20.53 cm and 1718.28 cm2, respectively. The prediction showed the maximum pseudostem height, pseudostem girth and leaf area at the 24th week of planting at the rate of 1 ml L-1 were 59.3 cm, 19.91 cm and 1785.17 cm2, respectively. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

Background: Inflorescence dichotomy in Musa species is a rare developmental event which leads to the production of multiple bunches on a single pseudostem at fruiting. In spite of its fascinating attraction and seductive appeal, little is known about the cytogenetic basis and molecular mechanisms that could be ascribed to this phenomenon. To bridge this gap in information, an integrative approach using cytological fingerprinting and DNA ploidy level profiling (based on chromosome counting and flow cytometry) were assayed on five inflorescence dichotomous plantain varieties and a single-bunching cultivar that served as control. This was done to assess the number and behaviour of chromosomes on the one hand and single nucleotide polymorphisms identified during analysis of nucleotide variations on the other. Results: Chromosomes stained with aceto-orcein were very tiny, compact, metacentric and acrocentric, and differed both in number and ploidy level between the inflorescence dichotomous and single-bunching cultivars. The dichotomous plantains were mainly diploid (2n = 2x = 22) while the single-bunching 'Agbagba' cultivar was consistently a triploid (2n = 3x = 33), as revealed by histological chromosome counting and flow cytometry, implying that there was a high incidence of genomic divergence on account of ploidy variations among the different Musa cultivars. Molecular genotyping using single nucleotide polymorphisms detected on the GTPase-protein binding gene of the leaf tissue gene complex provided further evidence indicating that differences in the number of bunches among the inflorescence dichotomous cultivars could be ascribed to nucleotide diversity that was elicited by changes in amino acid sequences in the genome of the crops. Non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions resulted mainly from transversion (from purine to pyramidine and vice versa), tacitly implying that these changes were crucial and promoted a cascade of reactions in the genome that were, probably, responsible for the non-persistence of the dichotomization event(s) or the reversals in the bunch phenotype detected among the inflorescence dichotomous cultivars. Conclusions: This is the first report of cytogenetic fingerprints and nucleotide diversity detection among single- and multiple-bunching Musa cultivars. A clear distinction between the two groups was found that is indicative of variations both in ploidy level and nucleotide sequences. The pattern of single nucleotide polymorphisms provided profound clues suggesting that there was a high incidence of genomic divergence, due to random and unstable genetic events that were triggered by frequent spontaneous somatic mutations. © 2019 The Author(s).

Timing and distribution of attack on East African highland banana (Musa AAAEA) by the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) was studied in a field trial at a farm 25 km NE of Kampala, Uganda. Weevils were released at three densities (5, 20 and 40 females per mat) in 324 m2 banana plots (cv Atwalira) that had been established 18 months earlier and maintained relatively free of weevils. Two weeks after release, entire mats were removed and examined for weevil eggs and first instar larvae. At a density of 20 weevils per mat, oviposition occurred on 25% of plants less than 6 six months old (suckers) with an average of three eggs (range 0-16) per infested plant. At the same time, 85% of flowered plants were attacked with mean oviposition of 15 eggs (range 0-41) per plant. An inverse relationship existed between weevil population density and eggs/female/plant. Five females per mat produced an average of 7.2 eggs per flowered plant, whereas 20 females produced 15 eggs per flowered plant and 40 females produced 12.5 eggs. This suggests the existence of density-dependent factors in weevil oviposition. Over 90% of the oviposition occurred in the base of the pseudostem, with the remaining eggs found in the corm and roots near the soil surface. However, in stands displaying high mat, (a condition in which part of the corm appears above the soil surface) more eggs were found on the corm than pseudostem.

The effects of host and non-host plant odours on the foraging responses of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), were investigated in the laboratory through arena and olfactometer bioassays. Contrary to previous reports that banana rhizome and pseudostem were the most attractive parts to the weevil, dead leaves were most preferred. Comparison of dead banana leaves with dead leaves of other plants showed that attractant odours were present in yam, cocoyam and dead grasses but absent in cocoa and soybean leaves. Complete leaf senescence while the leaf was attached to the mother plant proved necessary for the development of the dead-leaf-based odours but the involvement of microbial organisms could not be demonstrated. It is possible that dead-leaf-based attractants could be used in combination with microbials such as entomogenous fungi and nematodes in integrated management of C. sordidus.

The horizontal and vertical distribution of plant parasitic root nematodes on banana (Musa AAA cv. Valery) was determined in a sandy clay loam in Costa Rica. Root samples were taken from soil blocks at distances of 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm from the pseudostem, from 0 to 120 cm depth at intervals of 15 cm, and from plants of 120, 150, 180 or 210 cm high (non-flowering), plus a set from plants at flower stalk. The horizontal distance from the pseudostem affected the percentage of Radopholus similis, Pratylenchus spp., and total nematodes (R. similis + Helicotylenchus spp. + Meloidogyne spp. + Pratylenchus spp.). There was a significant effect of soil depth on the density of each genus. An interaction between soil depth and plant height and with horizontal distance was found for R. similis and total nematodes. For the three horizontal distances from the pseudostem, the percentage of each genus decreased with soil depth. Higher percentages of R. similis and total nematodes were found at 0 to 30 cm horizontal distance from the pseudostem than at greater distances in the upper 30 cm of the soil profile. Therefore, samples for monitoring nematode populations in bananas should be taken within a horizontal distance of 0 to 30 cm from the plant base and down to 30 cm deep from the soil surface. Additional studies are needed to relate the nematode population density at this sampling point to yield.

Plantain (Musa spp. AAB, French, cv. Essong) was grown on an acid ultisol in southern Cameroon to determine yield response to (1) a hot-water treatment to control nematodes and (2) the application of fertilizer. Observations were made for 42 months. Establishment was unaffected by hot-water treatment or fertilizer. Hot-water treatment reduced nematode infestation to about 30% of that found in untreated plants and increased rhizome survival by 11%. Fertilizer application increased the proportion of bunch-producing plants from 44 to 65% through reduced die-back, toppling and pseudostem breakage during the dry season but had no effect on bunch weight per plant. Fresh bunch yield of the plant-crop was 10.2 Mg ha-1 in unfertilized, untreated, plots; fertilized plots produced 15.3 Mg ha-1 and hot-water treated plots 13 Mg ha-1. Fertilized and hot-water treated plots produced 20.8 Mg ha-1. First ratoon yields were unaffected by fertilizer, but increased due to hot-water treatment from 0.81 to 5.0 Mg ha-1. Plant-crop bunch weight decreased with increasing time between planting and harvest. Mean bunch fresh weight was negatively correlated with an index of root nematode infestation and positively correlated with the number of living roots. For the plant-crop and plant-crop plus ratoon yields, the yield increase due to combined use of fertilizer and hot-water treatment was larger than increases attained by individual measures. Thus combination of hot-water treatment and fertilizer had a synergistic effect on plantain fresh bunch yield, justifying introduction of both measures simultaneously.

Host location, acceptance and larval success were studied in a mixed cultivar trial consisting of three East African cooking bananas, two East African beer banana and Kayinja (an exotic cultivar used for beer making). Weevil damage to the endemic cultivars was 5 to 25 times higher than that of Kayinja. Capture of weevils in pseudostem traps at the base of banana mats was highest for Kayinja, while egg density on Kayinja was similar to that of four endemic cultivars. Therefore, host location and acceptance do not appear to be factors in host plant resistance. In contrast, larval survivorship indices were 10 to 23 times higher in endemic cultivars than in Kayinja suggesting that larval success may be an important factor in resistance to banana weevils. Timing of attack was similar among cultivars. Oviposition occurred throughout the banana cycle with egg density increasing with plant age. These data provide a possible explanation of differences in weevil attack found among banana cultivars in Uganda.

The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development. Host plant resistance offers another promising avenue of control. Numerous resistant clones are known, including Yangambi-km 5, Calcutta 4, and Pisang awak. Resistance is most often through antibiosis resulting in egg or larval failure. Banana breeding is a slow and difficult process. Current research is exploring genetic improvement through biotechnology techniques including the introduction of foreign genes. Neem has also shown potential for control of banana weevil. Studies on the use of other botanicals against banana weevil have failed to produce positive results. Chemical control of banana weevil remains a common and effective method for larger scale producers but is beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers. However, the weevil has displayed the ability to develop resistance against a broad range of chemicals. In summary, cultural control remains the most available approach for resource-poor farmers. A combination of several cultural methods is likely to reduce weevil pressure. Among the methods currently under study, microbial control, host plant resistance and neem appear to offer the most promise.

Controlled studies to determine the efficacy of pseudostem trapping in reducing adult populations of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), were conducted under farmer conditions in Ntungamo district, Uganda. Twenty-seven farms were stratified on the basis of C. sordidus population density (estimated by mark and recapture methods) and divided among three treatments: (i) researcher-managed trapping (one trap per mat per month): (ii) farmer-managed trapping (trap intensity at discretion of farmer); and (iii) controls (no trapping). Intensive trapping (managed by researchers) resulted in significantly lower C. sordidus damage after one year. Over the same period, C. sordidus numbers declined by 61% on farms where trapping was managed by researchers, 53% where farmers managed trapping and 38% on farms without trapping; however, results varied greatly among farms and, overall, there was no significant effect of trapping on C. sordidus numbers. Moreover, there was only a weak relationship between the number of C. sordidus removed and the change in population density. Trapping success appeared to be affected by management levels and immigration from neighbouring farms. Although farmers were convinced that trapping was beneficial, adoption has been low due to resource requirements.

The effect of weed management on banana (Musa AAA cv. Grande Naine) parasitic nematodes was evaluated under Costa Rican field conditions with special reference to their spatial distribution and the damage caused to roots of different thickness classes and their relation to yield losses. Root samples were taken at plant harvest, from soil blocks at 0-30,30-60 and 60-90 cm from the pseudostem, and at every 15 cm depth, from 0 to 120 cm. Weed management neither affected the nematode numbers nor their horizontal and vertical distribution and associated root damage. Differences in Radopholus similis (P<0.0001), Helicotylenchus spp. (P=0.0115) and total nematode populations (P<0.0001) were found in roots of different thickness. The average populations in thick, thin and fine roots were for R. similis 270,666 (57%), 120,401 (25%) and 11,313 (2%); for Helicotylenchus spp. 36,094 (7%), 22,508 (5%) and 8,824 (2%); and total nematodes 390,425 (65%), 145,534 (31%) and 21,177 (4%), respectively. No linear correlations were found between bunch weight and the number and density of nematodes or with their damage. Even though, no statistical difference was found in bunch weight, the manual weed control plot yielded 1.4 kg heavier bunches, which might have important implications for sustainable agriculture. The implementation of weed control by hand chopping may improve the physical, chemical and biological soil properties and reduce soil erosion, temperature fluctuations, evaporation rate, and nutrient leaching, and increase water infiltration. As a consequence of the decrease in herbicide applications, soil and air pollution might be reduced. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin (Ascomycota: Hypocreales) survives as an endophyte in a wide range of plants, offering substantial protection against tunneling insect pests. Although current research indicates that the fungus can live as an endophyte in tissue-cultured banana plants, there is no information on the efficacy of endophytic B. bassiana against the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Our study aimed at determining the effects of endophytic B. bassiana on oviposition rate and populations of the banana weevil, and their plant damage. Screenhouse studies were undertaken in which 8-week-old B. bassiana-inoculated tissue-cultured banana plants [cultivar Kibuzi, Musa spec. (Musaceae), genome group AAA-EA] were infested with female banana weevils. Five days after plant infestation with the banana weevil, there was no effect of B. bassiana on oviposition rate and egg hatchability. However, after 15 weeks, the presence of B. bassiana as an endophyte in banana tissues greatly reduced banana weevil populations and their damage to plants. Between 53.4 and 57.7% of the banana weevil adults died because of B. bassiana infection, resulting in a reduction of plant damage by 29.1-62.7% depending on plant part. Beauveria bassiana was re-isolated from different plant parts, but to a greater extent from the roots and rhizomes than from pseudostem bases. Artificial inoculation of B. bassiana in banana plants caused no negative impact on banana growth. Our study demonstrated for the first time that endophytic B. bassiana reduced populations of C. sordidus and the plant damage they cause, and can thus be an alternative method for effective delivery of this fungus to banana plants for the management of C. sordidus. © 2008 The Authors.

The banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus, is the most important insect pest of banana and plantain in the world. Cultural control methods were investigated over 2 years in southern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Harvesting at ground level and dissection of remnants (treatment 1), and covering the base of the mat (entire plant consisting of several meristems) with soil and moving debris to the inter-row (treatment 2), were compared to a positive control that involved treatment of plants with a registered pesticide (treatment 3), and a negative control that involved harvesting at 150 cm from the collar with no soil or sanitation amendments (treatment 4). Yield, weevil damage and pseudostem girth of plants were measured from August to November annually, while adult beetle densities were assessed over 4 weeks in October/November and April. Nematode samples were taken and analysed in October/November every year. Damage parameters included the coefficient of infestation, the percentage coefficient of infestation (PCI) at two intervals, the summed PCI value, the percentage cross-sectional damage of the central cylinder and cortex, and the mean cross-sectional damage percentage. A randomized block design with three replicates was used in the trial. The parameters were similar before the onset of the trial. Fruit yield and plant girth, corrected by nematode densities, were not significantly different in any treatment, nor were the nematodes controlled. Soil cover and recession of remnants was the only effective treatment, significantly reducing the CI, but not the adult density or the other damage parameters. Soil cover showed promise as a cultural control method because it only needs to be applied seasonally and reduced the percentage cross-sectional damage of the central cylinder, the damage parameter most closely related to yield, by 14%. © 2008 The Authors.

The banana weevil (BRW), Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is the most devastating pest of banana in most production areas, which limits production and productivity of bananas throughout the world. Numerous chemical insecticides are available commercially to manage this pest. However, it was more expensive and undesirable for the management of this pest. In this study, the effect of commercially available neem-based botanical insecticide neem gold on BRW was studied under laboratory condition. The weevils were separately maintained up to 96 hours on neem gold treated banana rhizomes. The total and differential haemocytes count; total body protein and fat body protein profile were performed using SDS-PAGE. 33.33% of C. sordidus were settled on neem-gold and significantly (P<0.05) caused minimum mortality (6.7%) whereas 66.6% weevils preferred the untreated pseudostem. However, treatment reduced both total haemocyte count (40%) and various haemocytes level. The total body protein and fat body protein analysis shows that 4 KDa to 163 KDa molecular weight and 144 to 7 KDa molecular weight polypeptides respectively are present. Consumption of neem gold impregnated banana pseudostem reduced the total body protein polypeptide to 8 KDa whereas the fat body polypeptide increased from 161 to 8 KDa. These results suggested that neem gold could be used as insecticide against C. sordidus. © JBiopest.

Cost implications and lack of knowledge for ideal pest control practices are among the major factors limiting banana and plantain (Musa spp.) production in Nigeria. A trial was designed to control banana weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus), a major insect pest, and termites (Microtermes spp.), an occasional pest, by low-cost methods. The main plot treatments included the cultivars TMPX 5295 and TMPX 7152-2 (AAA genotypes) and 'Agbagba' and 'Red Ogoni' (AAB genotypes). Treatment combinations of mulching with neem (Azadirachta indica) leaves, application of poultry manure, and minimal application of insecticide (chlorpyrifos) constituted the subplot. The split-plot trial was arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Numbers of weevils and termites were monitored in 2004 and 2005. Significantly lower weevil numbers were observed in plots treated with insecticide or neem mulch (with or without manure) compared with the untreated control (with or without manure). Weevil and termite numbers observed in insecticide treated plots were not significantly lower than those in the neem mulched plots during the plant or first ratoon crops. Significantly higher weevil larvae numbers were observed in the control plants (2.2 plant-1) compared with those that received insecticide or neem mulch applications (maximum 0.4 plant-1). In the first ratoon crop, significantly lower numbers of adult weevils and larvae were observed in cultivars with an AAA genotype than in the Red Ogoni cultivar. Cultivar had no significant effect on termite infestations. The interaction of treatments and cultivars significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced weevil number in the crop but did not reduce termite numbers. Significantly higher mean total fruit yields (minimum 15 t ha-1) were obtained from the insecticide and neem treated plants compared with the control (maximum 11 t ha-1) at the end of the first ratoon crop. The treatments showed prospect in the control of banana weevils.

This chapter describes the morphology of the musa plant and discusses the potential benefits of morphological diversity. The East African Highland bananas, also considered as the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, display a very variable pseudostem color, the intensity of which varies with environmental conditions. Thus, in the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, the pseudostem and leaf petioles tend to get darker as altitude increases. Leaf pigmentation and posture may affect photosynthetic efficiency and transpiration rates as described by Brun and Turner, but there are surprisingly not many recent studies relating leaf morphology to photosynthetic efficiency or transpiration of the existing cultivars. Continued elongation of the main stalk of the inflorescence causes the bunch to hang over, the bracts open and fall, disclosing the female flower clusters or hands. The female flowers undergo further development without being pollinated or fertilized. A comprehensive study of the root system of a wider gene pool is required to construct an ideotype target for genetic improvement of plantains and bananas. © 2011 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

1 The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus Germar (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a major pest in banana (Musa spp.) growing areas. The weevil is known to be relatively sedentary and closely associated with its host plant but little is known about the species' ability to migrate between banana fields and in nonhost habitats. 2 Mark-recapture experiments were conducted to assess the weevils' migration potential, possible differences between the sexes, and the relative attractiveness of pseudostem and pheromone baits. 3 One thousand two hundred marked weevils were released in the nonhost habitat at five distances (5, 10, 20, 40 and 70 m) from fresh pseudostem, and from pitfall traps baited with 45 mg of sordidin. 4 Two hundred males and 200 females were marked and released at five distances (5, 10, 20, 40 and 70 m) from the pheromone traps. 5 Distance and distance/bait interactions had a significant effect on recaptured weevils (binary logistic regression). The two baits were almost equally attractive to weevils in the range 0-10 m, whereas the pheromone was more attractive in the range 10-100 m. 6 Distance, bait and distance/bait interactions had a significant effect on the time elapsed from release to recapture (regression with life data) but the pattern observed was not consistent. 7 There was no significant difference between males and females with respect to distance or time elapsed from release to recapture. 8 The results obtained in the present study show that the migration potential of the banana weevil is greater than previously reported. This should be taken into account when new banana fields are established with clean planting material. Published 2011. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.

Nutrient composition, secondary plant substances and other host quality characteristics govern resistance and influence herbivore feeding. The current study was carried out to compare aspects of feeding behaviour and food utilization of banana weevil (Germar) (Coleptera: Curculionidae) larvae feeding on banana cultivars with different levels of resistance. In the first study, penetration times of larvae into tissue of seven banana cultivars (two susceptible, three intermediate and four resistant) were compared. Day-old larvae were placed on corm or pseudostem tissue of these cultivars and time taken to penetrate the tissue was recorded. Larvae generally took longer to tunnel into resistant cultivars, although Yangambi Km5 (resistant) did not fit this pattern. In the second set of studies, food consumption and growth of larvae were compared on cultivars: (i) Kisubi (resistant) vs. Atwalira (susceptible); and (ii) Mbwazirume (intermediate) vs. Kayinja (resistant). Day-old larvae were offered weighed pieces of corm that were changed every 4-7days. At each corm change, weights of the larvae, corms and frass were measured. Changes in corm and larval weight were calculated to determine larval growth and amount of tissue consumed. Larvae feeding on resistant cultivars had lower consumption and growth rates and longer developmental duration. It was concluded that low food consumption rates contribute to delayed development of larvae feeding on resistant cultivars. Differences between resistant and susceptible cultivars in food utilization may be of limited consequence for the cultivars tested. This is one step in identifying the factors influencing weevil development rates in cultivars of different resistance levels. If these factors are identified, they can be targeted in breeding for resistance. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag, GmbH.

Context: Banana is one of the most important fruits crops among the different fruit crops in the agricultural and its intensively cultivated in all over the parts of Bangladesh especially in northern part. Many species of plant parasitic nematodes are association with banana root systems and are mainly responsible for controlling the banana productions to greater extend. Objective: Keeping in view of the disturbing nature of the nematode pest, the present study was undertaken to examine the biodiversity of plant parasitic nematodes associated with banana intensively grown in northern districts of Bangladesh. Materials and Methods: The collection of nematodes was conducted in the banana growing areas of Bogra, Natore, Rajshahi, Rangpur and Gaibandha districts. In each area, banana fields of different commercial cultivars were chosen for collection of soil and root samples. From each field 10 plants were selected randomly for sample collection. Each subsample consisted about 1 kg of soil and 20 g of fleshy roots taken from a single mat from a depth of 10-30 cm and from three equidistant points (40-50 cm) around the pseudostem Nematodes were extracted from soil by Cobb's sieving technique and from root by Mechanical maceration technique, and processed by Seinhorst's slow dehydration method. Fixing was done in boiling lactophenol cotton blue and finally by formalin glycerin solution. Dehydrated nematodes were kept in glycerol-ethanol solution and mounted permanently on glass slides. Identification was done up to species following the keys. Results: Among the plant parasitic nematodes ten species belonging to nine genera, six families of a single order, viz. Helicotylenchus dihystera, Rotylenchulus reniformis, Meloidogyne incognita, Hoplolaimus galeatus, Tylenchorhynchus mashhoodi, Tylenchorhynchus annulatus, Criconemoides sp., Hemicriconemoides cocophillus, Cephalenchus emarginatus and Aphelenchus avenae were encountered. Among the non-parasitic nematodes 15 genera belonging to seven families and three orders viz. Acrobeles, Acrobeloides, Aporcelaimus, Aporcelaimium, Aporcelaimellus, Cephalobus, Dorylaimus, Dorylaimoides, Discolaimus, Discolaimium, Discolaimoides, Indodorylaimus, Mylonchulus, Iotonchus, and Rhabditis were found to be associated with soils in banana field. It was found that species H. galeatus, C. emarginatus and M. incognita were present in all the surveyed areas. Four species of parasitic nematodes viz. C. emarginatus, H. cocophillus, Criconemoides sp. and A. avenae and 5 genera of non parasitic nematodes viz., Aporcelaimium, Aporcelaimellus, Discolaimium, Discolaimoides and Indodorylaimus are reported for the first time in Bangladesh. Conclusion: Present investigation have clearly indicated that the association of plant parasitic nematodes especially the most an important nematodes species like Hoplolaimus galeatus, Cephalenchus emarginatus and Meloidogyne incognita would cause severe economic yield loss to banana plantation in the study area.

The pseudostem weevil (Odoiporus longicollis) is one of the most dangerous pests in banana crop. On farm and laboratory experiments were carried out at the Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Pechiparai, Kanyakumari District, Tamil Nadu, India during the period 2010-2011 to assess the bio-efficacy of Beauveria bassiana, Azadirachtin 10000 ppm and monocrotophos (spray and injection) insecticide against pseudostem weevil, Odoiporus longicollis Oliver (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in Red banana. Injection of monocrotophos @ 4ml/plant registered the highest per cent reduction (76.07%) followed by the injection of Azadirachtin 2ml/plant (70.0%), application of B. bassiana @ 25g on the pseudostem trap (56.75%) and monocrotophos spray (38.39%). However, application of monocrotophos (4ml/plant) and Azadirachtin (2ml/plant) by stem injection proved to be more effective than by spraying of monocrotophos. Stem injection of monocrotophos, Azadirachtin and the application of B. bassiana recorded the highest per cent mortality of 96.15, 84.74 and 75.36%, respectively, after 96 hrs of application. All the treatments were found to increase the fruit yield with better cost benefit ratio. © JBiopest.

The present study was conducted in two successive seasons (2009/2010 and 2010/2011) on the first and second ratoons of Williams banana plants cultivated in loamy clay soil under flood irrigation at a private orchard located at Tanta, Gharbia Governorate, Egypt. Four planting densities (ranged from 933 to 1400 plants feddan-1) were examined to study their effect on vegetative growth, flowering, yield and fruit quality of Williams banana. Banana plants grown at close spacing had taller pseudostem than plants grown under wide spacing. The highest yield per feddan was obtained from plants spaced at 3×2 in with two plants per hole, followed by those at 3×1 in, with one plant per hole since it was 34.07 and 30.33 tons in the first ratoon and 34.80 and 31.50 in the second ratoon for both planting distances, respectively. Earliest bunch shooting and minimum days for harvesting were recorded with planting distance 3×4 in with three plants per hole and bunch emerged earlier (12-13 days) than bunches produced from plants spaced at 3×1 in with one plants per hole in both first and second ratoons, respectively. Heaviest bunches were harvested from plants at 3×4 in spacing with three plants per hole. Increasing yield per feddan by this planting distance could be attributed mainly to the increasing number of plants in the area unit. The highest finger weight, length, Total Soluble Solids (TSS%) and total sugars% were produced from plant spaced at 3×4 in with three plants per hole. © 2012 Academic Journals Inc.

The aim of this study was to assess the transmission of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana among adults of banana weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus) in the field. C. sordidus healthy adults were marked and released on the basis of banana plants. Two days later insects marked and inoculated with the entomopathogenic fungus were released in the same area. Pseudostem traps were placed at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days for recover of released insects and to evaluate the mortality. It was observed that 3.7% of the non inoculated insects died due to pathogen infection caracterizing B. bassiana transmission between inoculated and healthy insects due to an increase in natural pre-existing prevalescence that was 0.3% of infected insects.

Banana xanthomonas wilt (XW) caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum (Xcm) attacks all banana cultivars. Xcm in inflorescence-infected Pisang Awak plants with wilting male bud bracts is restricted to the upper parts of the true stem; therefore, cutting these plants at the pseudostem base has been recommended to prevent further Xcm spread. In order to fine-tune existing control strategies, this study examined the movement of Xcm into plants and mats, in relation to disease incubation period. Mature Pisang Awak and East African highland (AAA-EA) plants were inoculated with Xcm through abscission wounds of female bracts, male bud bracts, male flowers, a combination of male bud bracts and flowers, and by cutting male buds with a contaminated machete. Thirty plants per genotype and treatment were monitored for 24 months for disease symptoms. An additional 68 AAA-EA and 33 Pisang Awak plants were sampled weekly to assess the rate of Xcm spread within the plants. All floral entry points resulted in disease, with the highest incidence in combined male bract and male flower abscission wound inoculations. The study confirmed the systemicity of Xcm, with the pathogen able to live within the mat for long periods (5-16 months) without causing disease. Reliance on disease symptom expression to manage XW is therefore not sufficient. The long incubation period in lateral shoots may explain the current resurgence of the disease in locations where the disease was thought to have been successfully eradicated. © 2012 The Authors Plant Pathology © 2012 BSPP.

The objective of this study was to select strains of Beauveria bassiana for controlling Cosmopolites sordidus (Germ.) in plantain farms (cv. Terra) of the "Recôncavo" and southern regions in the state of Bahia, Brazil. The virulence of 32 B. bassiana isolates against C. sordidus was determined under laboratory conditions. Three isolates (CNPMF 407, CNPMF 218, and CNPMF 416) were selected for evaluation under field conditions in plantations located in the counties of Mutuípe and Wenceslau Guimarães. Population of C. sordidus was estimated every 15 days by using pseudostem traps. The efficiency of the three strains of B. bassiana was compared to chemical control (carbofuran, 4g/trap) and absence of control. Carbofuran caused around 90% of adult mortality after 12 months, with a reduction in the population of C. sordidus since the first evaluation. A low number of trapped insects was observed in the fungus-treated plots, suggesting the efficiency of the isolates in controlling the C. sordidus population. The strain CNPMF 218 was the most efficient in controlling C. sordidus adults in both locations, causing around 20% mortality, leading to 40% population size reduction after 12 months. © 2013 Marilene Fancelli et al.

Small-scale banana producers in Tanzania are facing constraints caused by the destructive activities of the banana weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus Germar). Many currently used methods of addressing the problem are ineffective or too expensive for local farmers to implement. Materials and methods. A combination of two integrated pest management (IPM) tools (regular trapping in combination with field sanitation) was tested at two farmer-managed sites (Bujela and Kyimo) and one researcher-managed site (SUA-Morogoro). Treated areas were surrounded by untreated control areas where no trapping and limited sanitation was done. Changes in population densities were estimated by the mark-recapture procedure and the Lincoln index. Results and discussion. After eight months, weevil populations in the cleaned and trapped areas had been reduced by 33% (Bujela), 33% (Kyimo) and 74% (SUA). The change in population sizes in the control areas differed greatly, possibly due to discrepancies in field management between farmers' and researchers' practice. Trap types, areas and sites affected the number of weevils captured. Disc-on-stump (DOS) traps captured more weevils than corm disc (CD) and pseudostem (PS) traps. Weevils responded more strongly to traps in the clean area at SUA compared with the other two sites, probably because the more rigid sanitation practices at SUA meant that volatiles from the traps were less likely to be masked by volatiles from surrounding residues. Conclusion. Regular trapping with field sanitation can greatly reduce populations of banana weevils, but strict adherence to method execution is required in order to gain favourable results. © 2013 EDP Sciences.

An attract-and-kill approach based on pellets from soybean or palm stearin fats blended with the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana (Bals.) Vuill. sensu lato and the aggregation pheromone sordidin (Cosmolure®) was tested against the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). The viability of B. bassiana conidia, blended with hydrogenated oil and exposed for up to 150 min to heating at 50 °C, was not affected and the aggregation pheromone did not undergo any decomposition. Conidial viability in pellets decreased by 50% after an average of 15.1 and 9.1 days at 25 and 40 °C, respectively, when packaged in polypropylene bags. Active packaging (hermetic bag + O2/moisture-absorbing sachet) increased the shelf lives almost 10 and 6 times at 25 and 40 °C, respectively. In olfactometer bioassays, fat pellets amended with pheromone (sordidin, 1% wt/vol) were highly attractive to C. sordidus adults for up to 15 days, after which the pheromone release rate had decreased by about 90% and pellets were no longer attractive. Pellets with pheromone and conidia were as attractive to C. sordidus as banana rhizomes, and considerably more attractive than pieces of pseudostem. In no-choice experiments conducted in boxes, survival of insects exposed to fungus-impregnated pellets was affected by fat type (soybean fat vs. palm stearin) and bioassay temperature (25 vs. 30 °C), with results favoring soybean fat pellets at the higher temperature (96.9% of mortality after 18 days and ST50 of 7.7 days). However, mortality levels were low (21.7% for soybean fat pellets) or very low (1-5% for palm stearin pellets) in choice experiments carried out at 25 °C when fungus-impregnated pellets were applied before or after exposure of pseudostem residues to insects, respectively. The potential of this delivery system to manage C. sordidus populations and other insect pests (including those with cryptic habits) is discussed. © 2014 The Netherlands Entomological Society.

Banana Xanthomonas wilt (XW), caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum (Xcm), results in up to 100% yield loss. The efficiency of XW infection through the corm, pseudostem inoculation at bunch harvest, leaf, female and male bud bracts was evaluated in banana plants. The male and female bud bract inoculations caused the highest incidence (81% and 93%) compared with 0-44% for harvest and corm inoculations. Naturally mediated insect transmission in Pisang Awak resulted in up to 99% disease incidence. Floral inoculations and natural insect-mediated infections only resulted in floral symptoms. Symptom development in insect-transmitted infections simulated artificial male bud inoculations, confirming the male bud bract wounds as the main entry points for insect vector-mediated infections, thus reaffirming the importance of continuous and timely debudding to limit insect spread. Leaf and harvest inoculations resulted only in leaf symptoms, while corm inoculations resulted in late floral symptoms. Floral inoculations were the main mode of infection. Single leaf inoculations resulted in 30% plant mortality despite 100% incidence, with 70% of plants recovering and bearing visibly healthy bunches and suckers. Thus, detection of a diseased plant in a mat shouldnt warrant the destruction of the whole mat. A significant difference in Xcm cfu g-1 was observed between symptomatic and symptomless leaves, suggesting that practices that keep the bacterial load below the disease-causing threshold could benefit the plant. This could explain the observed success of XW control through removal of single diseased stems in farms. © 2014 The Canadian Phytopathological Society.

Bacterial diseases of bananas and enset have not received, until recently, an equal amount of attention compared to other major threats to banana production such as the fungal diseases black leaf streak (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) and Fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense). However, bacteria cause significant impacts on bananas globally and management practices are not always well known or adopted by farmers. Bacterial diseases in bananas and enset can be divided into three groups: (1) Ralstoniaassociated diseases (Moko/Bugtok disease caused by Ralstonia solanacearum and banana blood disease caused by R. syzygii subsp. celebesensis); (2) Xanthomonas wilt of banana and enset, caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum and (3) Erwinia-associated diseases (bacterial head rot or tip-over disease Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora and E. chrysanthemi), bacterial rhizome and pseudostem wet rot (Dickeya paradisiaca formerly E. chrysanthemi pv. paradisiaca). Other bacterial diseases of less widespread importance include: bacterial wilt of abaca, Javanese vascular wilt and bacterial fingertip rot (probably caused by Ralstonia spp., unconfirmed). This review describes global distribution, symptoms, pathogenic diversity, epidemiology and the state of the art for sustainable disease management of the major bacterial wilts currently affecting banana and enset. © 2017 Blomme, Dita, Jacobsen, Pérez Vicente, Molina, Ocimati, Poussier and Prior.

The recent surge in demand for exotic ornamental crops such as orchids has led to a rise in international production, and a sharp increase in the number of plant and plant products moving between countries. Along with the plants, diseases are also being transported and introduced into new areas. Fusarium is one of the major diseases causing pathogens infecting orchids that is spreading through international trade. Studies have identified several species of Fusarium associated with orchids, some are pathogenic and cause symptoms such as leaf and flower spots, leaf or sheath blights, pseudostem or root rots, and wilts. Infection and damage caused by Fusarium reduces the quality of plants and flowers, and can cause severe economic losses. This review documents the current status of the Fusarium-orchid interaction, and illustrates challenges and future perspectives based on the available literature. This review is the first of Fusarium and orchid interactions, and integrates diverse results that both furthers the understanding and knowledge of this disease complex, and will enable the development of effective disease management practices. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH

Laboratory bioassays were conducted using an electroantennogram (EAG) and Y-tube olfactometer to study the electrophysiological and olfactory responses of banana pseudostem weevil (BSW), Odoiporus longicollis to its aggregation pheromone, 2-methyl-4- heptanol (2M4H) and host plant extract (HPE). The aggregation pheromone and HPE from highly susceptible cultivar Nendran were tested individually and in combination to ascertain the synergistic effect of HPE on 2M4H to the BSW. The peripheral response of antennae to the 2M4H + HPE combination elicited significantly strong amplitude of 4.089 ± 0.043 mV in males in comparison to females over the aggregation pheromone and HPE individually. Dose-dependent responses indicated difference between sexes and concentrations. Behavioural assay using Y-tube demonstrated that both sexes responded to host volatiles, and that males were more sensitive than females. Similarly, both the sexes responded most strongly (64.21% ± 3.91% of males and 55.47% ± 3.06% of females) to the odour sources comprising pheromone with host plant volatiles. Addition of HPE to 2M4H significantly increased EAG activity and also the attraction as indicated in the Y-tube behavioural bioassay; thus, the blend forms a good attractant. The present study provides information useful in developing pheromonebased lure in conjunction with HPE for monitoring and mass-trapping of O. longicollis. © 2019, Current Science.

The absorption of the micronutrients B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn by banana (Musa sp.) cultivar "Prata Anã" explants on the basic medium of Murashige & Skoog supplemented with BAP (3.5 mg/L) and sucrose (30 g/L) were evaluated at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 days after the inoculation. The experiment was arranged on a completely randomized design with three replications. Concentration of the micronutrients in the medium and in dry matter of the whole propagule and in the rhizome, pseudostem and leaves was also evaluated. Absorption of Mn was approximately constant during all the period of the experiment, while the other micronutrients had their higher absorption observed on the first 20 days. At the end of the experiment concentrations of B, Zn, Mn and Cu in the medium were 52, 61, 77 and 78%, respectively. These results point out that it is possible to reduce the concentration of these micronutrients on the basic medium MS for banana explants culture.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlations between vegetative and productive characteristics of banana tree (Musa spp) cv Prata-Anã (genomic group AAB) differently managed from the conventional system. The experiment was carried out in an orchard with five years old banana plants spaced by 3,5 x 2,0 m, in the Fazendas Reunidas FFL Ltda., at Cristais Paulista, São Paulo, Brazil. The experiment was a split plot under a completely randomized design with three replicates, being the main treatments constituted by: M1 - daughter-plant without the mother-plant whose stem was cut after flowering; M2 - daughter-plant and mother- plant conventionally managed until harvest. The sub plots were constituted by twelve periods of selection of the daughter-plants (February 2002 to January 2003). The pseudostem diameter and the bunch weight of all plants and the vegetative period of the daughter-plants were evaluated. The statistical analysis showed a positive correlation between the stem diameter of the daughter-plants and mother-plants. The stem diameter of the mother-plant was positive correlated with its bunch weight. However the stem diameter of the daughter-plant not was correlated with its bunch weight. The vegetative cycle and the pseudostem diameter of the daughter-plants were negatively correlated. The Plant management (M1 and M2) and the selection of periods daughter-plant did not affected the correlations evaluated in this study.

An investigation about the genetical diversity among eleven banana diploid genotypes using nine agronomical characteristics and sixteen microsatellite markers was implanted at Embrapa Cassava and Tropical Fruits, Cruz das Almas (BA), Brazil. The generalized distance of Mahalanobis indicated the presence of genetic diversity. The genotypes were grouped into tree clusters. Among the investigated characteristics, the plant height, number of bunch's, number of fruits per bunch and pseudostem exhibited high contribution towards genetic divergence. The average number of alleles per primer was 7.51, with a total of 120 alleles identified. The average similarity among the all diploid was 0.44, range from 0.29 up to 0.60. New parental combinations can be identified with base of the divergence between these diploids, contributing for development of new improved diploids preventing the narrow genetic base and creating new genetic variability for selection.

The salinity is a common factor of abiotic stress that seriously affects the agricultural production where it is found. One of the strategies to promote reincorporation of salinity areas and the productivity increasing consists in development and selection of tolerant genotypes, which allows parental identification for crossings. This research aimed to identify the salinity tolerance among banana diploid genotypes to be used in future works of genetic improvement to saline soils of Brazilian northeast region. Nine banana diploid genotypes (AA) were evaluated for growth variables as leaf area, height, diameter of pseudostem, leaves number, weight of fresh and dry matter. During 21 days, the plants were treated with 0 and 100 mM of NaCl, in an entirely randomized experimental delineation with three repetitions. After 21 days, the determination of fresh matter weight was released using analytic balance. The attainment of the each plant dry matter weight from foliar limbo, pseudostem and root+rizome was carried out through drying in greenhouse at 65°C until constant weight. The Tjau Lagada genotype, which suffered minor reduction of leaf area, can possibly show a higher production despite other genotypes analyzed in this study. The genotype 0116-01, presenting a greater salinity tolerance, could be used in future crossings providing genes to be incorporated in productive cultivars by improvement programs which aims the adaptive cultivars to Brazilian northeast saline soils.

Under some cultivation conditions, excessive growth of the pseudostem of banana plants can be considered a limiting factor, and thus, the use of growth regulators can constitute a valid alternative. This work aimed to evaluate the action of paclobutrazol on the growth of the pseudostem of banana plants and other characteristics of their development. An experiment was installed with five paclobutrazol doses (0; 0.5; 1.0; 1.5; and 2.0 g of a.i. plant-1) combined with two banana plant cultivars ('Prata Anã' and 'FHIA-01'). Paclobutrazol did not affect the number of days from planting to flowering, total leaf area and leaf emission rate. However, it increased leaf permanence on the plants and sucker number, reduced the foliar area of the leaves emitted after its application and provided an average reduction in pseudostem height of 26%.

To estimate the demand of micronutrients for the banana plants (Musa spp.), it is essential to know the amounts of dry matter and micronutrients accumulated in the plant and exported by the bunch. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accumulation of dry matter and micronutrients by six banana varieties under irrigation. Plants of Grande Naine, Pacovan, Pacovan- Apodi, Prata-Anã, Terrinha and Gross Michel varieties grown in double rows, with a density equivalent to 1,666 plants per hectare were sampled. At harvest four plants of each variety were selected for sampling of mother-plant, which was divided into rhizome, pseudostem, petiole, leaf blade, stalk and fruits. The plant parts were weighed to determine the fresh weight of each part and a sample of about 700 g of each part was collected to determine dry weight and contents of micronutrients. The samples were washed quickly with tap water and later with distilled water and placed in a greenhouse for pre-drying and afterwards conditioned in paper bags were put in an oven of forced circulation of air for obtaining the dry matter and subsequent determination of the contents of B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn. The varieties Pacovan, Prata Anã e Pacovan Apodi accumulated greater amounts of dry matter and micronutrients, when compared to the varieties Grande Naine, Gross Michel e Terrinha, observing the following decreasing order of accumulation and export of micronutrients: Mn > Fe > B > Zn > Cu.

The goal of this work was to make a agronomical evaluation of the vegetative characteristics and income of five cultivars of banana type Plantain, in the first production cycle under irrigation in the semi-arid conditions of the region of the city of Guanambi - Bahia State. Relevant phenotypic descriptors were used for the identification and selection of individuals with superior characteristics, so as to make available to the producers of the perimeters of irrigation an alternative for the diversification of the banana crops. The evaluated genotypes AAB were the varieties Terra, Terra-Maranhão, Terrinha and D'Angola and the hybrid AAAB: FHIA-21. The following characteristics were analyzed: number of days from the sowing to the flowering and to the harvest, height of the plant, perimeter of the pseudostem, number of alive leaves at flowering and harvest, gap flowering-harvest, weight of the bunch, of the peduncle and of the hands, number of hands and fruits per bunch, length and diameter of the fruit. The procedure employed was randomized blocks, with five treatments, consisting of the cultivars AAB: Terra, Terra-Maranhão, Terrinha and D'Angola and the hybrid AAAB: FHIA-21, and five repetitions. Each plot was comprised by 20 plants: four rows of five plants, with six useful plants in the spacing of 3,0 m x 3,0 m. Terra and Terra Maranhão were the most productive varieties, however, with larger load and late cycles. The hybrid FHIA-21 and the varieties Terrinha and D'Angola showed a larger number of living leaves in the harvest.

The objective of the present study was to select diploids (AA) hybrids of banana based on three non-parametric indices as to guide the selection and increase the use of the variability present in the Banana Germplasm Bank of Embrapa Cassava and Tropical Fruits. Eleven hybrids were evaluated in random blocks with four replicates. The plots consisted of six plants spaced 2.5 m × 2.5 m whereas the border rows were from the Pacovan cultivar. The following characteristics were evaluated: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of suckers, number of leaves during flowering, plant cycle from planting to bunch emission, presence of pollen, number of hands, number of fruits, fruit length and yellow-Sigatoka resistance. The average of these ten characteristics was used for calculating the multiplicative indices of sum of classification and genotype-ideotype distance. The two hybrids presenting best global performance SH3263 and 1318-01 ranked respectively, first and second by the multiplicative indices and sum of classification whereas the genotype-ideotype distance index ranked them first and fourth. Although in general, all three indexes presented good coherence between general performance of the hybrids and their classification, the multiplicative and sum of classification indexes provided a more adequate classification of these hybrids.

The objective of this research work was to evaluate the influence of the pseudostem pruning with elimination of the apical meristem of the rhizome and of doses of nitrogen and boron on the production and growth of banana suckers. The experiment was carried out at Centro de Formação de Tecnólogos-UFPB, state of Paraíba. The experimental design was randomized blocks, with four blocks and nine mother plants by experimental unit, being two useful plants. The evaluated factors were doses of N (0 to 240 g plant-1) and of B (0 to 2, 2 g plant-1) combined by the use of the experimental matrix 'Central Composite', originating nine treatments, applied with pruning and without pruning of the mother plant pseudostem. The data were submitted to the analysis of variance and regression. In the plants with pruning, it was reduced the sucker number, which presented smaller growth, on the other hand, it increased the concentration of total chlorophyll. For the production of 'Pacovan' banana suckers, it is recommended the pruning of the mother plant pseudostem with elimination of the rhizome apical meristem and the application of N.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of Prata banana plants during three production cycles, under different irrigation systems, in semi-arid conditions. A randomized block design was adopted with six treatments, in a 3×2 factorial arrangement: three irrigation systems - conventional sprinkler, microsprinkler and drip - and two genotypes - 'Prata-Anã' and its hybrid PA42-44. Four replicates in plots with six useful plants were used. Plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of alive leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area, and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. Weight of bunch and hands, mean weight of hands, weight of the three first hands, number of hands and fruits per bunches, and weight, length and diameter of fruits and number of alive leaves were evaluated during the harvest season. The drip irrigation system provides smaller vigor to banana Prata, in comparison to conventional and to micro sprinkler systems, as can be seen by the size and perimeter of the pseudostem. The cultivar Prata-Anã shows a larger number of fruit and hands per brunch, while its hybrid PA42-44 shows larger weight, length and fruit diameter.

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of organic manure for five crops, on growth and yield characteristics of banana 'Prata-anã'. The experiment was installed in Botucatu, SP, Brazil, in November 2002 with conventional plants spaced 2.5 x 2.5 m. Plants were fertilized with organic compost produced with sawdust and manure, properly composted, which provided the following treatments: 0, 43, 86, 129 and 172 kg of compost per plant. The compost rates were calculated according to the potassium content in the compost. In 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, at blooming, the pseudostem circumference and the plants height were evaluated, as well as the number of living leaves per plant. At harvest, the bunch weight, the number of fruits per bunch, the number of hands per bunch, the bunch weight of the 2nd, the number of fruits in the 2nd bunch, the fruit length and diameter were evaluated. The organic compost rates did not influence the plant growth. However, concerning the crop cycles it was observed a decrease in the leaves number from the second cycle on, and also changes in plants height and pseudostem circumference. In this study, where the K2O rates ranged from zero to 394 g per plant, the bunches of higher weight were obtained with the two higher amounts of compost, which indicates that economically, the dose of 129 kg compost per plant, which corresponds to 290.5 g of K2O per plant, is the best to be recommended.

The objective of this research was to evaluate the growth and the production characteristics, and to characterize the quality attributes of fruits of Figo Cinza cultivar in two production cycles, 2009 and 2010. Growth characteristics such as plant height, pseudostem circumference, number of actives leaves, number of suckers, number of days between flowering and harvest, were evaluated at the inflorescences emission. Production characteristics, such as bunch weight, number of fruits, number of hands and, number, length and diameter of the fruits of the 2nd bunch were also measured. For fruit quality the following physical and chemical characteristics were analyzed: firmness, pH, titratable acidity and soluble solids. The experimental design was completely randomized with two treatments (cycles), five replications and two plants per plot, and means were compared by Tukey test (P &lt; 0.05). In general the characteristics of growth and production were higher in the second cycle, with 134 days from flowering to harvest, pseudostem circumference of 64.20cm, plant height of 3.82m and bunch weight of 11.83kg. The attributes of quality did not vary between cycles, but the texture was higher in the second cycle with an average of 993.31 gf cm-2.

The fertilization with micronutrients is poorly studied for banana production, especially boron (B) application, which affects the development of apical meristems. This experiment aimed to study responses of B fertilization with different rates and application methods in banana plant 'Grande Naine'. The experimental design was in randomized block and factorial scheme with three rates (0.85, 1.70 and 3.40 g plant-1) and three fertilizer application methods (soil, leaves and tiller hole chopped) and a control, without B application, using boric acid as the source of B. Treatments effects were evaluated by B availability on soil, plant grown, plant nutritional status and by the yield. Treatments effects were submitted to variance analysis and when significant it was adjusted by regression equations. The B application on soil and in the leaves increased this micronutrient content in topsoil (between 1.0-1.5 mg kg-1, with the highest rate of the nutrient) and a corresponding increase up the soil layer to 20-40 cm, as a result of leaching. The contribution of foliar fertilization increasing the content in the soil was due to the washing and by draining the fertilizer solution from the leaves to the soil surface. Moreover, there was no effect of B availability in the soil when the fertilizer was applied in the tiller hole chopped (~0.3 mg kg-1 of B). It was also verified that there were no effects of B application on banana plant growth (height and pseudostem diameter) at the blooming stage. In leaf samples, collected each 15 days, it was observed that when the micronutrient was applied in the tiller hole chopped, leaf B concentration was higher and lasted up for one month. However, in the last foliar sampling (at blooming) it was observed that there was no effect of application methods on leaf B concentration (~20 mg kg-1). There were no effects of fertilization in yield according to rates and application methods of B, but the application on the tiller hole chopped promoted an increased accumulation of this micronutrient in the bunch due to the applied rates. Under the conditions of this experiment, it can be concluded that B application did not influenced the development and production of banana plant 'Grande Naine' according to the rates and application methods of this micronutrient.

The objective of this study was to examine the molecular and phenotypic variability of 'Prata Anã' banana clones cultivated in northern Minas Gerais State. For the phenotypic and molecular characterization, the clones were collected from five properties. The morphological characterization of 20 clones was accomplished through a qualitative evaluation of 74 descriptors. For the molecular evaluations, 45 clones were collected, and 14 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA primers were used. Among the 74 morphological descriptors evaluated in the 20 'Prata Anã' banana tree clones, 53 descriptors presented in the same homogeneous class for all clones. The presence of anthocyanin in the pseudostem (ANT) and the shape (BUS) and flexion (FLX) of the bunch clearly differentiated the 'Prata Anã' banana clones from the commercial cultivar. A total of 176 bands were produced from the molecular analysis using the 14 RAPD primers; there were 116 monomorphic and 60 polymorphic bands, with an average polymorphism percentage of 52.2%. The amplification using the OPP 14 primer resulted in the greatest percentage of polymorphic bands at 88%. The dendrogram indicated that each of the 45 'Prata Anã' clones that were evaluated using RAPD markers clustered with the commercial 'Prata Anã' cultivar.

Ten diploid banana genotypes (Musa spp.) were evaluated with regard to salt tolerance, abiotic stress which limits the productivity of the crop. The plants were grown during 21 days, in a nutrient solution with and without the addition of NaCl (0 and 100 mol m-3). Growth variables including leaf area, fresh and dry biomass, biomass allocation and growth rate were analysed. The experiment was implemented in a completely randomized design in factorial (10 × 2) arrangement and three replicates per treatment. Salinity caused in most genotypes reductions in almost all variables. Genotype Lidi stood out by having better adaptation to saline stress in all measured biometric variables with the ability to maintain, under stress, the fresh and dry biomass (leaf blade, stem, pseudostem + root), leaf area, and absolute growth rate among others. The relative production of dry biomass of shoots was more than 70%, characterizing this as a tolerant genotype and promising to be integrated into breeding programs. Genotypes Ouro and Tungia, in turn, showed reduction of absolute growth rate and relative dry biomass production (less than 50%) were characterized as sensitive to salinity.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the yield and the cycle of banana trees treated with paclobutrazol (PBZ). We tested five doses of PBZ (0.0; 0.5; 1.0; 1.5 and 2.0 g plant-1), applied on the soil around 'Prata Anã' and 'FHIA-01' banana trees four months after planting. Data were obtained during the first cicle and the bunchs were harvested when yellow color was observed on the peel of the first fruits. The cicle time was of 507 days, not differing in terms of doses and cultivars. The use of PBZ reduced pseudostem length. Increasing of PBZ doses increased the number of active leaves at inflorescence emission period of 'Prata Anã', but the effects on bunch were harmful, with reduction of the number of fruits per bunch, of commercial length and diameter of the fruits, which caused reduction of bunch weight and of productivity. In FHIA-01 cultivar, PBZ applied via soil reduced pseudostem length and improved bunch sustentation, not influencing crop productivity. The optimal dose of PBZ on 'FHIA-01' banana tree is around 1,0 g plant-1. For the 'Prata Anã' is not recommended the use of PBZ.

The productivity in banana is a complex character that results from the combination of different factors, influenced by environment. This work aimed to study the direct and indirect effects of vegetative traits on production in three cycles in banana. The work was conducted in the Experimental Field of Embrapa Acre in Rio Branco, Acre, among years 2003 and 2006. Thirteen genotypes of banana (Preciosa, Japira, Pacovan Ken, Pacovan, BRS Platina, Prata Anã, ST12-31, Nanicão, Grande Naine, Calypso, Ambrosia, Bucaneiro and FHIA 02) were evaluated, spaced 3 m × 2 m, in the randomized blocks with five replicates. The evaluated traits were: plant height, diameter of pseudostem, number of leaves at flowering and harvest, weight of bunch and number of hands in the bunch. Analysis of variance and path analysis were carried out for each cycle and phenotypic correlation coefficients were estimated. The trait weight of the bunch was adopted as the basic variable and the others were considered the explanatory variables. The study of direct and indirect effects showed that the character output is much influenced by the environment in the first cycle, and the following production cycle is much influenced by vegetative traits, especially number of leaves at harvest.

The objective of the present study was to estimate the phenotypic correlations between the number of fruits per bunch and 22 characters evaluated in banana (AA) diploid hybrids. The experiment was carried out at Embrapa Cassava and Fruits in randomized blocks with four repetitions and 11 (AA) banana diploid hybrids were evaluated. The following characteristics were evaluated: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of suckers, number of leaves during flowering, plant cycle until emission of the bunch, presence of pollen, bunch and rachis weight, yellow Sigatoka at bunch emission, number of leaves at harvest, yellow Sigatoka at bunch harvest, number of days from emission to harvest, length and diameter of stem, weight of second hand, number of hands and fruits per bunch, pedicellum fragility, length and diameter of fruit and length of pedicellum and presence of seeds. Correlation studies between the number of fruits and the other plant characteristics were carried out. These correlations varied between genotypes; therefore, it was observed that the associations between number of fruits and vegetative characteristics of plants were, in general, non-significant. However, the relationships between the number of fruits per bunch and the other production characteristics were predominantly significant.

Phytotechnical characters observed in field experimental are of phenotypic nature and most of the time its assessment is based only on the experience of the observer. The assessment of the correlations between variables allows the estimation of the changes in a character based on the changes in other characters. This present study estimated the impact of agronomic characters related to the weight of the bunch measured in banana plants. The experiment was a test for uniformity, conducted in Guanambi, Bahia, by using the cultivar Tropical (YB42-21), an AAAB tetraploid hybrid. The vegetative characters evaluated during flowering included plant height, perimeter of the pseudostem, number of offshoots, and number of living leaves. The yield related characters were evaluated during the harvest and included, bunch's weight, number of hands and fruits, weight of the second hand, and length and diameter of the fruit in two production cycles. In the evaluations, each plant was considered as a basic unit (bu). This work described a protocol for prediction of banana yield by using the artificial neural networks (ANNs) method as modeling tool. The computational model ANN was used and the prediction of the weight of the bunch in banana plants cv. Tropical was estimated with precision and efficiency (R2=91%, MPE=1.40 and MSD=2.29). © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of castor bean pie on the infestation by Cosmopolites sordidus and on the development of banana plants cv. Terra. To observe the dose-response relationship, each treatment focused on a different dosage of castor bean pie (0 g, 12 g, 15 g, 18 g, 24 g) applied every two months to the banana plants, starting from the planting date. The experimental design was completely randomized with ten replicates. Plant vegetative growth was evaluated by measuring plant height, pseudostem diameter, and counting alive (or green) leaves. The infestation of plants was undertaken by using 25 adults of C. sordidus per plant. Six months after planting, the percentage of damage caused was scored on rhizomes and the number of adults (alive and died), larvae, and pupae was registered. Absorbance related to the leaf chlorophyll content was also determined by a chorophyllometer. In plants treated with castor bean pie there was a low infestation of the banana weevil borer. Vegetative growth and absorbance were also positively affected by applying castor bean pie. Therefore, castor bean pie reduces C. sordidus population in rhizomes of bananas cv. Terra, improving vegetative growth and chlorophyll content in leaves.

The high density planting of some banana cultivars is an usable practical to increase productivity, especially in regions affected by Sigatoka. This study aimed to evaluate the development and production of banana plant 'Grande Naine' grown in different planting densities with black leaf streak presence at Vale do Ribeira, SP. It was installed a banana orchard with seedlings produced in vitro of the Grande Naine cultivar. The experimental design was a completely randomized, in factorial scheme 5 x 2, with five densities (2,500; 2,222; 2,000; 1,667 and 1,111 plants.ha-1) and two production cycles. The black leaf streak severity was weekly monitored using the state evolution method (SE) and its control were set when occurred the second consecutive progression of the severity and/or increases of 200 points from a week to the next. For each plot it was evaluated eight plants measuring plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of active leaves at blooming and at harvest, bunch fresh weight, productivity, number of hands, bunch fruits number, total fresh weight and individual fresh weight of the 2nd hand, length and diameter of 2nd hand fruits. Data were submitted to variance analysis by F test and the significant means were compared by Tukey test (5% probability). Under the experimental conditions, it can be concluded that the density did not influence the plant development (plant height and pseudostem diameter). The biggest plants density gave higher banana plant 'Grande Naine' yields.

Banana genotypes grown under different irrigation systems may express different vegetative traits and yields, even if all other crop conditions are similar. This study aimed to evaluate the vegetative traits of two banana genotypes of the Pome subgroup (AAB) under different irrigation systems in semiarid conditions during three production cycles. The experimental design was a randomized block design with six treatments in a 3×2 factorial scheme: three irrigation systems (sprinkler, micro-sprinkler and drip) and two genotypes ('Dwarf Pome' and 'BRS Platina', earlier reported as 'PA42-44'). Four replications were used, with six plants spaced at 3.0×2.5 m per net plot. Plant height, pseudostem girth, number of functional leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. In addition the number of functional leaves, weight of bunch and number of hands was also evaluated at harvest. Interactions between the treatments were not significant. Irrigation systems affected vegetative traits. The drip irrigation system reduced growth as measured by plant height and pseudostem girth, for both genotypes, compared with conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems. The weight of the bunch in the second cycle and the number of hands in the third cycle were higher for plants grown under conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems compared to drip irrigation. The 'Dwarf Pome' showed higher number of hands per bunch than 'BRS Platina'.

The experimental design was in randomized blocks with 11 genotypes and three replicates with four plants per plot in 3 m x 2 m spacing. The following agronomic characteristics were evaluated: plant height (m); pseudostem diameter (cm); number of live leaves at flowering; number of live leaves at harvest; stem length (cm); stem diameter (cm); bunch weight (kg); hand weight (kg); single hand weight (g); number of hands; number of fruits per bunch; pedicel length (cm); pedicel diameter (mm); finger drop susceptibility (Lb); firmness of pulp with peel; fruit weight (g); fruit length(cm); fruit diameter (mm); elongation index; pulp weight (g); pulp/peel ratio; pulp yield (%); pulp diameter (mm), peel thickness (mm); pulp thickness (Lb), tritable acidity-TA (%), soluble solids-SS (°Brix), SS/TA ratio and pH. Of the thirty variables evaluated, 12 were significant for the source of variation ‘cycles´. As to the ‘genotype x cycles’ interaction it is possible to assert that there was no differentiated behavior in the genotypes from the first to the second production cycle, except for ‘plant height’, ‘number of live leaves at flowering’, ‘fruit diameter’ and ‘peel thickness´. Results for the effect of ‘genotypes’ were significant for all characteristics, except for fruit ‘finger drop susceptibility’. Considering the agronomic data, genotypes from the YB series and the cultivars BRS Princesa and BRS Garantida showed to be promising for cultivation in the Reconcavo region of Bahia for presenting good agronomic performance. © 2014 Sociedade Brasileira de Fruticultura.

In the irrigated area of Jaíba in Northern Minas Gerais, there are reports on the presence of some genotypes of banana cv. Prata-Anã supposedly tolerant to the Panama disease, where the disease was not established after 15 years of cultivation even in the presence of the pathogen. Therefore this study aimed to evaluate the genetic diversity, agronomic performance and behavior of genotypes of banana ‘Prata-Anã’ cultivated in area with a history of Panama disease. Twenty-four families were collected, 11 classified in the moment of the collection as diseased (GEN 1, GEN 2, GEN 3, GEN 4, GEN 5, GEN 6, GEN 7, GEN 8, GEN 9, GEN 10 and GEN 11), and 13 apparently healthy (GEN 12, GEN 13, GEN 14, GEN 15, GEN 16, GEN 17, GEN 18, GEN 19, GEN 20, GEN 21, GEN 22, GEN 23 and GEN 24). This material were multiplied in tissue culture laboratory and taken to planting at the experimental area. Twenty-four treatments were evaluated (clones of banana ‘Prata-Anã’), in a randomized block design with three replications, 20 plants per plot and the central six in useful area. In addition to the genetic diversity, length and diameter of pseudostem, leaf number, bunch, hands and rachis weight, number of hands and fruits, length and girth of the central fruit of the second hand, the percentage of dead plants, incidence and severity of Panama disease were evaluated. The average genetic distance between clones was 43.5%, ranging from 11.8% to 85%. Individuals GEN 12, GEN 13, GEN 19 and GEN 22 showed larger pseudostem at ground level and at 30 cm above the ground, and were higher. Individuals GEN 13, GEN 17 and GEN 19 stood out in both production cycles as Panama disease tolerant. © 2014, Sociedade Brasileira de Fruticultura. All rights reserved.

The objective of this study was to agronomically characterize plants from induced chromosome doubling experiments in the Pisang Lilin parthenocarpic banana accession to select genotypes that will be used as 2n gamete donors in crosses with improved diploids to generate secondary triploids. Twenty-two plants were evaluated, of which 17 were autotetraploids. Compared with the original diploids, the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids showed significant increases in the plant height, number of living leaves at flowering and harvest, pseudostem diameter, and length and diameter of fruits; the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids also exhibited greater fruit and bunch weights compared with the original diploids. In addition, all autotetraploid plants did not exhibit any symptoms of yellow Sigatoka. Female fertility was also detected, as some plants produced seeds, indicating that they can be used as female parents. Therefore, the autotetraploids characterized in this study exhibited useful agronomical traits to be used as 2n gamete donors for generating secondary triploids. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

The favourable climatic conditions make Brazil one of the most important producers of tropical flowers, among them some Heliconia native species are remarkable. In the present study 19 acceßions of H. chartacea were characterized using morphological descriptors related to pseudostem, leaf and inflorescences. The purpose was to select acceßions with desirable aspects for cut flower production. The experiment was carried out during August 2014 and January 2015. Differences were observed in morphological descriptors related to the inflorescences. In 54% of the inflorescences that were harvested, the length was between 30 and 60 cm and varied according to the number of open bracts. The width was larger than 40 cm in 75% of the inflorescences. About 70% of the harvested stems had weight above 200 g and the average stem diameter was between 20-30 mm. The latter feature was directly related to the stiffneß of the flower stem. The length of the peduncle varied between 10 and 20 cm for 60% of the stems. The vase life of the flower stems ranged between 5 and 11 days. In general, most of the studied acceßions were suitable for use as cut flower, nevertheleß more detailed evaluation is neceßary.

This study aimed to evaluate development and production of banana plant ‘Grande Naine’ under different management systems with black leaf streak presence at Vale do Ribeira, SP (Brazil). For the experiment it was used micropropagated seedlings of ‘Grande Naine’ banana that was planted in field in a completely randomized design with five treatments (management systems): interspersed planting; fungicide control; defoliation + interspersed planting; defoliation + fungicide control and control, which were subdivided in time (two production cycles), with eight repetition and one plant per repetition. It was evaluated the following parameters: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of active leaves at blooming and at harvest, marketable fruits fresh weight, productivity, number of hands, number of fruit, total fresh weight and individual fresh weight of the 2nd hand, length and diameter of 2nd hand fruits. Data were submitted to variance analysis by F test and the significant means were compared by Tukey’s test (5% probability). It can be conclude that fungicides applications were effective for black leaf streak control, showing better results in plants development and production and also in fruit quality of cultivars Grande Naine. No differences were observed when fungicide application was associated with defoliation. The interspersed planting affected negatively all the development and production parameters of cultivar Grande Naine. © 2015, Sociedade Brasileira de Fruticultura. All rights reserved.

The characterization and evaluation of new genotypes bananas is an important step both for breeding programs and for nomination to producers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the yield and fruit quality post-harvest of 'Maravilha' and 'Preciosa' bananas in the first and second production cycles, grown in Sub-middle São Francisco Valley. The seedlings produced by tissue culture, were transplanted to the field after six month old, cultivated in the spacing of 3 × 3 m. Both two cycles, for all characteristics was adopted a completely randomized design with two treatments (cultivars), 10 replicates and two plants per plot, with external borders. The following variables were evaluated: production cycle (days between planting and harvesting), plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of adult leaves, bunch fresh mass, number of cluster and fruits per bunch, fresh mass of the second cluster; number, length and diameter of fruits of the second cluster, pulp/skin ratio, firmness, pH, soluble solids (SS), titratable acidity (TA) and SS/TA ratio. The 'Maravilha' banana showed plant and yield characteristics superior to 'Preciosa' banana; in the physical and chemical characteristics, the 'Preciosa' banana had fruit with higher sugar content, however, smaller size; and for other characteristics, the two cultivars showed behavior similar to each other in the first and second production cycles.

Brazil is the sixth largest producer of banana; however, traditional practices of banana propagation fall short when the intention is to introduce a uniform, pathogen-free banana plantation, with high yield potential . This research aimed to evaluate the vegetative growth and production of 'Prata Anã' banana derived from conventional seedlings (whole rhizome) of different sizes (up to 1000g, 1001 to 2000g, 2001 to 3000g, 3001 to 4000g, 4001 to 5000g, and more than 5000g) and in vitro micropropagation, during the first and second production cycles. The experimental design was completely randomized, with a variable number of repetitions. Analysis of variance was performed using regression equations for the vegetative data and Tukey test at 5% of probability for production data. Micropropagated plants originating from rhizomes with weight of less than 1000g, between 1001g and 2000g resulted in plants with more vegetative vigor, in the first cycle. In the second cycle, the number of leaves, height and diameter of the pseudostem tended to equalize for tratadifferent classes of plants assessed. In the first production cycle, periods between planting and floral anthesis and between planting and harvesting were inversely proportional to the size of conventional seedlings; the periods for micropropagated plants were similar to the conventional seedlings of greater weight. There was no difference in the number of hands, fingers and bunch weight between the different classes of seedlings. The differences between the amount of time from planting to flowering and until harvest among the different classes of seedlings tend to disappear from the first to the second cycle. Thus, the propagation of the banana with seedlings weighing less than 2000g or micropropagated is preferable; however, it is possible to use any kind of seedlings, planted in various plots according to the size.

The evaluation of tetraploid genotypes, originated from crosses between commercial triploid and diploid cultivars, improved or wild, has been made to solve traditional problems of cultivars of Prata type, as susceptibility to pests and diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the yield and fruit quality of banana trees 'Pacovan Ken' and PA94-01 genotype during the first and second production cycles in Vale do São Francisco in the northeast of Brazil. The seedlings were produced by the tissue culture process and transplanted into the field at six months of age, spaced 3.0 × 3.0 m. In both production cycles, the following variables were evaluated: number of days between planting and harvesting, plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of adult leaves, bunch fresh mass, number of bunch and fruits per bunch, second bunch fresh mass; number, length, and diameter of second buch fruits, pulp/peel ratio, firmness, pH, soluble solids (SS), titratable acidity (TA), and SS/TA ratio. The PA94-01 genotype had more vigorous plants and with better productive characteristics in the two production cycles. However, the cycle duration and physicochemical characteristics of fruits were similar to those of 'Pacovan Ken' fruits.

Being one of the important tropical and subtropical fruit trees, banana (Musa.spp.) belongs to the family Musaceae and the order Scitaminae with two genera, Musa and Ensete. In a field survey, research team has discovered a potential banana mutant strain ‘HD-1’ with a sound economic value. The results of the finding are as follows: based on Simmonds’ classification, the pseudostem of banana strain ‘HD-1’ is relatively short and purplish red; its upright outward petiole groove has red edges and wraps its pseudostem loosely. Its ploidy is 3×, AAA type. Karyotype analysis shows that the number of chromosomes is 33, the karyotype formula is 2n=3x=33=2L + 3 M2 + 4 M1 + 2 S, ‘HD-1’ is classified as ‘1B’ type. With the help of ISSR molecular markers, we find thatbanana 'HD-1' has the closest relationship with Pubei and Tianbao dwarf banana; the similarity coefficient is 0.81. In an artificial simulation tests of cold, drought and salt resistance environment changes of physiological and biochemical indexes indicate that ‘HD-1’ exhibits stronger defense capability than Brazil banana. By way of inoculation with injury of root dipping method, we respectively treat two kinds of banana seedlings inoculated Banana Fusarium wilt race 4 small species. The results show that their resistance evaluation scores are 3 and 4, disease levels are ‘susceptible’ and ‘high sensitivity’ respectively. We conclude that ‘HD-1’ has stronger resistance ability toFusarium wilt than Brazil banana. © 2016, Pakistan Botanical Society. All rights reserved.

The present study evaluated plant morphological traits and fruit quality parameters of banana 'Dwarf Cavendish' cultivar and local type 'Azman' grown in subtropical conditions, under unheated plastic greenhouse. The study was conducted between 2014 and 2015 in Alanya, the province of Antalya. The planting density was 1850 ha-1 and drip irrigation system was used. Plant morphological features (plant height, stem circumference and height, leaves retention at flowering and bunch stalk circumference), yield components (number of hands, number of fingers, finger circumference and length, and bunch weight) and fruit quality attributes (peel thickness, the peel and pulp ratio, soluble solid content) after ripening were determined. The plant height, stem height, number of hand, bunch weight and finger features were the most variable traits. 'Dwarf Cavendish' produced shorter plants and pseudostem height. Bunch weight and finger features in 'Azman' were found to be superior to 'Dwarf Cavendish'. As 'Azman' type produced higher yield (69.3 t ha-1 year-1) than 'Dwarf Cavendish' cultivar (52 t ha-1 year-1), this local type is recommended for cultivation under unheated greenhouse.

This paper presents the morphological classification of 19 Musa species and cultivars. Fifteen morphological characters for Musa acuminata and M. balbisiana and 50 morphological characters adapted from International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plant (UPOV) codes were employed to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship between both banana species. Analyses of genetic similarity based on all of these morphological characters suggested that bananas with A-genomes were in the same cluster. Moreover, a genetic similarity coefficient of 0.36 was obtained between M. acuminata and M. balbisiana in the analysis with the 15 morphological characters for both species, and 0.47 in the analysis with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) of the 15 morphological characters suggested that PCI and PC2 together explained 78.6% of the total variance. A PCA with 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that PCI explained 80.6% of the total variance, for which the main variables were pseudostem length, leaf blade length, and peduncle length. PCA of the 15 morphological characters showed that 'Pei Chiao', 'Giant Cavendish', and 'Dwarf Cavendish' were proximal in the PCA scatterplot. Notably, the PCA of 50 UPOV-based morphological characters indicated that 'Pei Chiao' and 'Giant Cavendish' were near each other in the PCA scatterplot, suggesting that they are phylogenetically related. The PCA of M. itinerans var.formosana with 15 morphological descriptors showed that this variant is phylogenetically distant from M. acuminata and M. balbisiana accessions. In summary, the findings may contribute to the classification and breeding of banana germplasm. © 2018 Kyushu University. All rights reserved.

Banana growth and hence production is affected largely due to many biotic factors that include bacteria, fungi, viruses, aphids etc. Common bacterial wilt disease that affect banana is caused by Xanthomonas vasicola pv. musacearum (Xvm), Ralstonia solanacearum. Symptoms include progressive yellowing, wilting and blackening of leaves; yellow or brown vascular streaks throughout the plant; pockets of pale yellow bacterial ooze in airspaces within leaf bases; premature ripening and internal discoloration of fruits. Erwinia-associated diseases such as bacterial head rot or tip-over caused by Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora and E. chrysanthemi, bacterial rhizome and pseudostem wet rot caused by Dickeya paradisiaca formerly E. chrysanthemi pv. Paradisiacal are also reported in banana. Other bacterial diseases of less widespread importance include: bacterial wilt of abaca, Javanese vascular wilt and bacterial fingertip rot (probably caused by Ralstonia spp.) R. solanacearum is soil borne pathogen, very diverse in its species, and belongs to group of Ralstonia-species complex. The Biolog GEN III identification is used as the first step in identifying the isolates from infected plants. This technology classifies bacteria by ability of their cell to metabolise all major classes of biochemicals, in addition to determining other important physiological properties such as pH, salt, and lactic acid tolerance, reducing power, and chemical sensitivity. Due to their diversity in species and strains, suitable diagnostic procedure should be done to identify the pathogens accurately. Pathogen identification based on colony morphology or disease symptoms is difficult, time consuming and unreliable. Molecular diagnostic such as polymerase chain reaction using specific primer and the other diagnosis of pathogen is also possible by using bacteriophage due to its specificity to infective. Rapid detection and accurate identification of pathogens in plant are critical steps to prevent pathogens dissemination. Innovative agronomic practices could be employed to control/manage the diseases. Integration of cultural practices with sensitive and specific diagnostic tools, transgenic approaches and conventional breeding techniques may offer a more sustainable and environmental friendly approach to control and manage the bacterial diseases in banana. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the phytotechnical behavior of 'Prata-Anã' banana and four progeny hybrids, during two production cycles, in the Perímetro Irrigado do Estreito, southwest of Bahia state, Brazil. The experimental design was completely randomized with fi ve treatments: cultivar 'Prata-Anã' and the hybrids Fhia-01 (BRS Fhia Maravilha), BRS Fhia-18, Fhia 18 and PA42-44, with ten replicates. Phenotypic vegetative descriptors, cycle length and yield were measured. Increases occurred between cycles for: plant height, pseudostem perimeter, number of hands and fruits, and yield. The Fhia-18 hybrid showed greater size and pseudostem perimeter, and 'Prata-Anã' had the smallest, (with maintenance of this character in the PA42-44). The hybrids were similar in the number of suckers produced. BRS Fhia-18, PA42-44 and Fhia-1 were early for harvest and had greater fruit length than 'Prata-Anã'. Fhia-18 produced more fruit and PA42-44 had fewer hands compared to the parental cultivar. BRS Fhia-18, Fhia-18 and Fhia-1 are more productive than the parental cultivar. 'Prata-Anã' is more susceptible to yellow sigatoka, while PA42-44 is resistant, with greater retention of leaves at harvest; however, both have similar yields.

The fertilization with micronutrients is poorly studied for banana production, especially boron (B) application, which affects the development of apical meristems. This experiment aimed to study responses of B fertilization with different rates and application methods in banana plant 'Grande Naine'. The experimental design was in randomized block and factorial scheme with three rates (0.85, 1.70 and 3.40 g plant-1) and three fertilizer application methods (soil, leaves and tiller hole chopped) and a control, without B application, using boric acid as the source of B. Treatments effects were evaluated by B availability on soil, plant grown, plant nutritional status and by the yield. Treatments effects were submitted to variance analysis and when significant it was adjusted by regression equations. The B application on soil and in the leaves increased this micronutrient content in topsoil (between 1.0-1.5 mg kg-1, with the highest rate of the nutrient) and a corresponding increase up the soil layer to 20-40 cm, as a result of leaching. The contribution of foliar fertilization increasing the content in the soil was due to the washing and by draining the fertilizer solution from the leaves to the soil surface. Moreover, there was no effect of B availability in the soil when the fertilizer was applied in the tiller hole chopped (~0.3 mg kg-1 of B). It was also verified that there were no effects of B application on banana plant growth (height and pseudostem diameter) at the blooming stage. In leaf samples, collected each 15 days, it was observed that when the micronutrient was applied in the tiller hole chopped, leaf B concentration was higher and lasted up for one month. However, in the last foliar sampling (at blooming) it was observed that there was no effect of application methods on leaf B concentration (~20 mg kg-1). There were no effects of fertilization in yield according to rates and application methods of B, but the application on the tiller hole chopped promoted an increased accumulation of this micronutrient in the bunch due to the applied rates. Under the conditions of this experiment, it can be concluded that B application did not influenced the development and production of banana plant 'Grande Naine' according to the rates and application methods of this micronutrient.

The information of a plant root distribution allows defining regions of soil around it suitable for fertilizer application and for sensor placement in order to improve irrigation schedule. The present study had as objective to evaluate root system distribution of banana cv.'Prata-Anã' irrigated by different systems, during the second production cycle. The experiment followed a random block design in a split split-plot scheme with three replications in which the variation sources consisted of three irrigation systems (drip, microsprinkler and conventional sprinkler), six distances from plant (0.15; 0.30; 0.45; 0.60; 0.75 e 1.00 m) and five soil depths (0.0 -0.20; 0.20 -0.40; 0.40-0.60; 0.60 -0.80 and 0.80-1.00 m). The banana root system remained near-surface soil, with its 80% at 0.61 m, 0.51 m and 0.61 m depth and at effective distance of 0.63 m, 0.66 m 0.79 m from the pseudostem for irrigation systems, drip micro sprinkler and conventional sprinkler, respectively. In general there were more roots with diameter less than 2 mm all over the evaluated root zone. The roots of larger diameter tended to concentrate near to the pseudostem with depths less than 0.40 m from soil surface.

The objective of this study was to examine the molecular and phenotypic variability of 'Prata Anã' banana clones cultivated in northern Minas Gerais State. For the phenotypic and molecular characterization, the clones were collected from five properties. The morphological characterization of 20 clones was accomplished through a qualitative evaluation of 74 descriptors. For the molecular evaluations, 45 clones were collected, and 14 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA primers were used. Among the 74 morphological descriptors evaluated in the 20 'Prata Anã' banana tree clones, 53 descriptors presented in the same homogeneous class for all clones. The presence of anthocyanin in the pseudostem (ANT) and the shape (BUS) and flexion (FLX) of the bunch clearly differentiated the 'Prata Anã' banana clones from the commercial cultivar. A total of 176 bands were produced from the molecular analysis using the 14 RAPD primers; there were 116 monomorphic and 60 polymorphic bands, with an average polymorphism percentage of 52.2%. The amplification using the OPP 14 primer resulted in the greatest percentage of polymorphic bands at 88%. The dendrogram indicated that each of the 45 'Prata Anã' clones that were evaluated using RAPD markers clustered with the commercial 'Prata Anã' cultivar.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the yield and the cycle of banana trees treated with paclobutrazol (PBZ). We tested five doses of PBZ (0.0; 0.5; 1.0; 1.5 and 2.0 g plant-1), applied on the soil around 'Prata Anã' and 'FHIA-01' banana trees four months after planting. Data were obtained during the first cicle and the bunchs were harvested when yellow color was observed on the peel of the first fruits. The cicle time was of 507 days, not differing in terms of doses and cultivars. The use of PBZ reduced pseudostem length. Increasing of PBZ doses increased the number of active leaves at inflorescence emission period of 'Prata Anã', but the effects on bunch were harmful, with reduction of the number of fruits per bunch, of commercial length and diameter of the fruits, which caused reduction of bunch weight and of productivity. In FHIA-01 cultivar, PBZ applied via soil reduced pseudostem length and improved bunch sustentation, not influencing crop productivity. The optimal dose of PBZ on 'FHIA-01' banana tree is around 1,0 g plant-1. For the 'Prata Anã' is not recommended the use of PBZ.

The productivity in banana is a complex character that results from the combination of different factors, influenced by environment. This work aimed to study the direct and indirect effects of vegetative traits on production in three cycles in banana. The work was conducted in the Experimental Field of Embrapa Acre in Rio Branco, Acre, among years 2003 and 2006. Thirteen genotypes of banana (Preciosa, Japira, Pacovan Ken, Pacovan, BRS Platina, Prata Anã, ST12-31, Nanicão, Grande Naine, Calypso, Ambrosia, Bucaneiro and FHIA 02) were evaluated, spaced 3 m × 2 m, in the randomized blocks with five replicates. The evaluated traits were: plant height, diameter of pseudostem, number of leaves at flowering and harvest, weight of bunch and number of hands in the bunch. Analysis of variance and path analysis were carried out for each cycle and phenotypic correlation coefficients were estimated. The trait weight of the bunch was adopted as the basic variable and the others were considered the explanatory variables. The study of direct and indirect effects showed that the character output is much influenced by the environment in the first cycle, and the following production cycle is much influenced by vegetative traits, especially number of leaves at harvest.

Due the necessity in improve the banana production system in Pernambuco State, Brazil, mainly in Siriji River Valley, a trail was carried out in Vicência County, with the objective to evaluate the behavior of seven banana genotypes (Pacovan Ken, PV 79-34, Japira, Preciosa, ST 12-31, YB 42-03 and YB 42-07) during two production cycles, using randomized complete blocks with four replicates and 12 plants per plot. The following characters had been considered: plant height; pseudostem circumference; number of leaves in the flowering and the harvest; number of days from plantation to the flowering and the harvest; flowering-harvest interval; mass of bunch, hands and fingers; number of hands and fingers; fruit length and diameter; and skin thickness. In first cycle, fruit mass, length and skin thickness were the ones that presented significant difference. However, in second cycle, there was difference among the most evaluated characters. Japira, Preciosa and Pacovan Ken hybrids presented potential to the exploitation in the Siriji River Valley, due advantages observed in the vegetative and production characteristics, beyond good acceptation among banana farmers, in relation to agronomic characteristics.

The objective of the present study was to estimate the phenotypic correlations between the number of fruits per bunch and 22 characters evaluated in banana (AA) diploid hybrids. The experiment was carried out at Embrapa Cassava and Fruits in randomized blocks with four repetitions and 11 (AA) banana diploid hybrids were evaluated. The following characteristics were evaluated: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of suckers, number of leaves during flowering, plant cycle until emission of the bunch, presence of pollen, bunch and rachis weight, yellow Sigatoka at bunch emission, number of leaves at harvest, yellow Sigatoka at bunch harvest, number of days from emission to harvest, length and diameter of stem, weight of second hand, number of hands and fruits per bunch, pedicellum fragility, length and diameter of fruit and length of pedicellum and presence of seeds. Correlation studies between the number of fruits and the other plant characteristics were carried out. These correlations varied between genotypes; therefore, it was observed that the associations between number of fruits and vegetative characteristics of plants were, in general, non-significant. However, the relationships between the number of fruits per bunch and the other production characteristics were predominantly significant.

Phytotechnical characters observed in field experimental are of phenotypic nature and most of the time its assessment is based only on the experience of the observer. The assessment of the correlations between variables allows the estimation of the changes in a character based on the changes in other characters. This present study estimated the impact of agronomic characters related to the weight of the bunch measured in banana plants. The experiment was a test for uniformity, conducted in Guanambi, Bahia, by using the cultivar Tropical (YB42-21), an AAAB tetraploid hybrid. The vegetative characters evaluated during flowering included plant height, perimeter of the pseudostem, number of offshoots, and number of living leaves. The yield related characters were evaluated during the harvest and included, bunch's weight, number of hands and fruits, weight of the second hand, and length and diameter of the fruit in two production cycles. In the evaluations, each plant was considered as a basic unit (bu). This work described a protocol for prediction of banana yield by using the artificial neural networks (ANNs) method as modeling tool. The computational model ANN was used and the prediction of the weight of the bunch in banana plants cv. Tropical was estimated with precision and efficiency (R2=91%, MPE=1.40 and MSD=2.29). © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the response of irrigated 'Prata Anã' banana (AAB) to soil application of phosphorus, in four production cycles. The experiment was carried out in the semiarid region of the north of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in a clayey Oxisol, with very low available P (4.6 mg dm-3, Mehlich). A randomized complete block design was used, in a 5x4 factorial arrangement, with five doses of triple superphosphate (0, 50, 100, 200, and 300 g P2O5 per plant per year), four production cycles, and four replicates. In the first cycle, the soil application of P increased plant height, pseudostem diameter, weight and number of fruits per bunch of banana; however, banana plants did not respond to P application in the second, third, and fourth cycles. 'Prata Anã' banana, even when grown in soil with low P content, responds to the application of this nutrient only in the first production cycle.

This study evaluated the influence of different irrigation levels on the growth of the banana crop cv. Grande Naine. The experiment was conducted in the experimental field of the Centro Nacional de Pesquisa Mandioca e Fruticultura. A randomized block design was used with six levels of irrigation and eight replications. The irrigation L1 corresponded to rain. The irrigation L6 was determined using the Kc and ETo. The other irrigation levels were determined by the formula NH = K × AF × ETo, where NH is the water requirement of the crop (L plant-1), K (empirical coefficient of plant transpiration), AF - leaf area (m2 plant-1) and ETo - reference evapotranspiration (mm). The parameters evaluated were: plant height, pseudostem circumference, leaf area, alive leaf number and duration of the crop cycle. The growth of cv. Grande Naine was influenced by irrigation, it is possible to estimate the water requirement of the banana crop, based on knowledge of leaf area and ETo. The best crop growth was obtained with a transpiration coefficient of 0.57 and irrigation depth estimated in 1247 mm.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of different water depths on the morphophysiological and yield variables of three Terra-type banana cultivars. A randomized complete block design was used, in a factorial arrangement with 12 treatments and three replicates. Treatments consisted of water depths correspondent to 33, 66, 99, and 120% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc), besides the control without irrigation, and of the cultivars Terra Maranhão, Terrinha, and D'Angola. The morphophysiological variables evaluated were: plant height, pseudostem diameter, leaf area, stomatal conductance, and, during harvest, the number of fingers and hands, and hand weight per bunch. Crop coefficients of the Terra-type banana cultivars were obtained from the best combination of yield and water use efficiency. The consumptive water-use depths of 1,599 mm (1.20 ETc), 922 mm (0.84 ETc), and 940 mm (1.06 ETc) correspond to the maximum yields and water use efficiencies of the cultivars Terra Maranhão, Terrinha, and D'Angola, respectively.

The high density planting of some banana cultivars is an usable practical to increase productivity, especially in regions affected by Sigatoka. This study aimed to evaluate the development and production of banana plant 'Grande Naine' grown in different planting densities with black leaf streak presence at Vale do Ribeira, SP. It was installed a banana orchard with seedlings produced in vitro of the Grande Naine cultivar. The experimental design was a completely randomized, in factorial scheme 5 x 2, with five densities (2,500; 2,222; 2,000; 1,667 and 1,111 plants.ha-1) and two production cycles. The black leaf streak severity was weekly monitored using the state evolution method (SE) and its control were set when occurred the second consecutive progression of the severity and/or increases of 200 points from a week to the next. For each plot it was evaluated eight plants measuring plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of active leaves at blooming and at harvest, bunch fresh weight, productivity, number of hands, bunch fruits number, total fresh weight and individual fresh weight of the 2nd hand, length and diameter of 2nd hand fruits. Data were submitted to variance analysis by F test and the significant means were compared by Tukey test (5% probability). Under the experimental conditions, it can be concluded that the density did not influence the plant development (plant height and pseudostem diameter). The biggest plants density gave higher banana plant 'Grande Naine' yields.

Banana genotypes grown under different irrigation systems may express different vegetative traits and yields, even if all other crop conditions are similar. This study aimed to evaluate the vegetative traits of two banana genotypes of the Pome subgroup (AAB) under different irrigation systems in semiarid conditions during three production cycles. The experimental design was a randomized block design with six treatments in a 3×2 factorial scheme: three irrigation systems (sprinkler, micro-sprinkler and drip) and two genotypes ('Dwarf Pome' and 'BRS Platina', earlier reported as 'PA42-44'). Four replications were used, with six plants spaced at 3.0×2.5 m per net plot. Plant height, pseudostem girth, number of functional leaves, length and width of the third leaf, total leaf area and leaf area index were evaluated at flowering. In addition the number of functional leaves, weight of bunch and number of hands was also evaluated at harvest. Interactions between the treatments were not significant. Irrigation systems affected vegetative traits. The drip irrigation system reduced growth as measured by plant height and pseudostem girth, for both genotypes, compared with conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems. The weight of the bunch in the second cycle and the number of hands in the third cycle were higher for plants grown under conventional sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation systems compared to drip irrigation. The 'Dwarf Pome' showed higher number of hands per bunch than 'BRS Platina'.

The objective of this study was to agronomically characterize plants from induced chromosome doubling experiments in the Pisang Lilin parthenocarpic banana accession to select genotypes that will be used as 2n gamete donors in crosses with improved diploids to generate secondary triploids. Twenty-two plants were evaluated, of which 17 were autotetraploids. Compared with the original diploids, the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids showed significant increases in the plant height, number of living leaves at flowering and harvest, pseudostem diameter, and length and diameter of fruits; the Pisang Lilin autotetraploids also exhibited greater fruit and bunch weights compared with the original diploids. In addition, all autotetraploid plants did not exhibit any symptoms of yellow Sigatoka. Female fertility was also detected, as some plants produced seeds, indicating that they can be used as female parents. Therefore, the autotetraploids characterized in this study exhibited useful agronomical traits to be used as 2n gamete donors for generating secondary triploids. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Brazil is the sixth largest producer of banana; however, traditional practices of banana propagation fall short when the intention is to introduce a uniform, pathogen-free banana plantation, with high yield potential . This research aimed to evaluate the vegetative growth and production of 'Prata Anã' banana derived from conventional seedlings (whole rhizome) of different sizes (up to 1000g, 1001 to 2000g, 2001 to 3000g, 3001 to 4000g, 4001 to 5000g, and more than 5000g) and in vitro micropropagation, during the first and second production cycles. The experimental design was completely randomized, with a variable number of repetitions. Analysis of variance was performed using regression equations for the vegetative data and Tukey test at 5% of probability for production data. Micropropagated plants originating from rhizomes with weight of less than 1000g, between 1001g and 2000g resulted in plants with more vegetative vigor, in the first cycle. In the second cycle, the number of leaves, height and diameter of the pseudostem tended to equalize for tratadifferent classes of plants assessed. In the first production cycle, periods between planting and floral anthesis and between planting and harvesting were inversely proportional to the size of conventional seedlings; the periods for micropropagated plants were similar to the conventional seedlings of greater weight. There was no difference in the number of hands, fingers and bunch weight between the different classes of seedlings. The differences between the amount of time from planting to flowering and until harvest among the different classes of seedlings tend to disappear from the first to the second cycle. Thus, the propagation of the banana with seedlings weighing less than 2000g or micropropagated is preferable; however, it is possible to use any kind of seedlings, planted in various plots according to the size.

The use of humic substances and plant extract has been increasing mainly in organic crop systems without scientificbased recommendations. Research is necessary to evaluate the feasibility and the recommendations of these substances. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of humic substances (humic and fulvic acids) applied by fertigation with and without saponin-based plant extracts on growth and yield of 'BRS Princesa' banana. The experiment was carried out using the banana cultivar 'BRS Princesa', at a spacing of 2.0 × 2.5 m, fertigated by drip irrigation in a Dystric Densic Xantic Ferralsol, at the Recôncavo da Bahia, Brazil. Treatments consisted of five doses of humic substances (0.0; 70; 105; 140, and 210 L ha-1 cycle-1) applied with and without a saponin-based plant extract in a randomized block design in split-plot scheme. The following growth variables were evaluated: number of leaves, pseudostem height, pseudostem diameter, and length and width of the third leaf. The number of fruits/hand and hands/bunch, hand and bunch yield, and length and fruit diameter of the second central hand were evaluated during harvest. The doses of humic substances influenced only pseudostem height. Hand yield, as well as fruit length and diameter of 'BRS Princesa' banana were higher in plants fertigated with humic substance and plant extract in comparison with plants fertigated with only humic substance.

Banana production stands out in Brazilian semiarid agriculture; however, due to little availability of water resources, associating water-saving technologies with the knowledge of parameters involved in the interplay between plants and soil is critical to improving banana production systems. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of planting densities and irrigation levels on root length density of ‘BRS Platina’ banana and to correlate root parameters to crop yield and leaf area. A randomized block design was used, with factors arranged in split-split plots and treatments replicated three times: four irrigation levels (55%, 70%, 85% and 100% ETc) were assigned to plots, four planting densities (1,600; 2,000; 2,666; and 3,333 plants ha-1) to subplots and distance from pseudostem or sampling depth to sub-subplots. Root length density (RLD) was measured at five distances from the pseudostem, longitudinally to a row of plants: 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.10 m; and at three depths for each distance: 0 to 0.20 m, 0.20 to 0.40 m and 0.40 to 0.60 m from surface level. Root length densities were highest at 100% ETc irrigation level and at 2,666 plants ha-1 and 3,333 plants ha-1, within 0.31 m deep and within 0.78 m of the pseudostem. Irrigation interacts with root system, and coupled with higher planting densities, contributes to increasing crop yields of ‘BRS Platina’ banana plants. © 2021 Federal University ofPiauI.

Managing seasonal production variations is sometimes necessary for banana plantations. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a modified pruning, with selection of later successor suckers for the production units, on the growth, harvest time, and bunch weight of 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana plants, when compared to conventional pruning. A completely randomized experimental design was used, with two treatments and ten replicates for the conduction of two experiments, one for each cultivar. The treatments consisted of conventional pruning and modified pruning (selection of later successor suckers). Conventional pruning was carried out maintaining the successor sucker (daughter plant), whose growth was evaluated until the flowering stage. Modified pruning was carried out with the removal of the successor sucker (daughter plant) after the flowering of the mother plant, and the subsequent successor sucker (granddaughter plant) was selected and grown as the daughter plant. The growth of the first and second suckers were quantified at intervals of approximately 60 days and the bunch weight and other production variables were determined. The pruning reduced the height and pseudostem perimeter of the first successor sucker and delayed the harvest time in at least 30 days without reducing bunch weight of both banana cultivars. The mean yields were 26.68 and 50.64 Mg ha-1for the 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana, respectively, regardless of the pruning management used. The second sucker of 'Nanica' banana presented a residual effect of the pruning on plant height, but not on production. The use of the modified pruning is feasible for changing harvest time of both cultivars. However, repeatedly use of this technique for the same production unit is not recommended, since it affects the h eight of the second successor sucker. © 2021 Federal University ofPiauI.

Fire resisting property was imparted to cellulosic paper by the application of a bio-enriched version of a banana pseudostem sap (BPS) as well as the only BPS, obtained as a byproduct during fibre extraction from the pseudostem. The papers were evaluated for their flame retardant property by measurement of limiting oxygen index and vertical flammability. They were also characterized by thermogravimetry, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The bio-enriched BPS treated paper was found to exhibit a better flame retardancy with distinguished char length, compared to the control and the only BPS treated paper. The impartment of flame resisting property to a paper by the BPS, along with its charring behaviour has been discussed and the mechanism thereon has been postulated. The BPS application was found to enhance the oxygen required for the burning of the paper and reduce its burning rate by promoting more dehydration and char formation. The imparted fire retardant finish found durable to weathering, did not cause any significant loss in tear and tensile properties of the paper. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to use the natural wastage plant product, bannana pseudostem sap (BPS) for using as fire retardant of cellulosic textile substrate. The study aims to use first time any wastage plant product for making fire retardant cellulosic textile. In this regard flame retardant functionality was imparted in cellulosic textile using BPS, an eco-friendly natural wastage product. Design/methodology/approach - The extracted sap was made alkaline and applied in pre-mordanted bleached and mercerized cotton fabrics. Flame retardant properties of the control and treated fabrics were analyzed in terms of limiting oxygen index (LOI), horizontal and vertical flammability and total heat of combustion using bomb calorimeter. The thermal degradation and pyrolysis was studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The chemical composition of the control and BPS treated cellulosic fabric were analyzed by FTIR, SEM and EDX. Durability of the flame retardant functionality to soap washing had also been studied. Findings - The study showed that the treated fabrics had good flame retardant property compared to control fabrics. The LOI value was found to increase by 1.6 times after application of BPS. As a result of this, the fabric does not catch flame. In horizontal flammability, the treated fabric showed burning with afterglow (without presence of flame) with a propagation rate of 7.5 mm/min, which is almost ten times lower than the control fabric. After application of BPS cellulosic fabric sample produced natural khaki colour. There was no significant change in other physical properties. Practical implications - The application process is simple and cost-effective as no costly chemicals were used. Further advantage is that the treated fabric could also be considered as natural dyed cotton fabric. The developed khaki colour is quite attractive and stable to sun light exposure. This developed process could used in colouration and flame retardant finishing of home furnishing products such as home-window curtain, railway curtain, hospital curtain, table lamp and as a covering material of non-permanent structure like in book fair, festival, religious purpose, etc., where large quantity of textile is used and has chance of fire hazards. Social implications - BPS abundantly available in Indian as well as other countries and it is normally considered as waste material. It is eco-friendly and produced from renewable source. Therefore, the application of BPS in cotton textile for colouration and functionalization will give the advantages of value addition using natural product. Rural people will be benifited lot by applying this technology whenever it required. Originality/value - This paper helps to clarify first time why and how a wastage plant product like BPS can be used for preparing fire retardant cotton cellulosic fabric. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Flame retardancy was imparted to ligno-cellulosic jute textiles using banana pseudostem sap (BPS), an eco-friendly natural by-product obtained during the extraction of fibres from the banana pseudostem. The extracted sap was made alkaline and applied to a pre-mordanted Greige fabric. The flame-retardant properties of both the control and treated fabrics were analysed in terms of limiting oxygen index (LOI), horizontal and vertical flammability, and the total heat of combustion. The treated jute fabrics showed a far better flame-retardant property compared to the control fabric. By 1.9 times increase in the LOI after application of the alkaline BPS, the treated fabric (1: 4) showed no flame and got self-extinguished within a minute. Based on thermal degradation, pyrolysis and dehydration studies, and analysis of the chemical composition of the flame-retardant finish prepared from the BPS, the mechanism of imparting flame retardancy to jute textiles has been postulated. The imparted finish was found semi-durable in soap wash, and did not cause any significant loss in tensile and tear strength of the fabric.

Waste is a substance that is considered by all as unwanted or additional material arising out of any industrial or agricultural operation process, product, by-product, or any other item at the end of their requisite service life. In a country such as the United Kingdom, about 4–5 % of municipal solid waste is composed of clothes/textiles, 25 % of which is recycled. A large amount of unutilised/processed material is generated in the agricultural, food processing, paper–pulp, and textile industries as waste or residue, such as lignin, sericin, dyes, sizing paste, leather fibre, banana pseudostem sap, cellulosic and ligno-cellulosic short to long biofibres, corncob, tomato seed and peel, and many others. The disposal of such waste or residue creates serious environmental pollution, either during their natural degradation, through the microbial pathway, or through incineration. As many of the agro, food, textile, and paper–pulp processing wastes or residues have high technical potential to be used for many diversified end-applications, they have been seriously considered through R&D efforts and application for the production of nanocellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, bacterial cellulose, recovery of dyes, water purification, biodegradable hard and flexible composites, substrates for tissue engineering, recycled textiles, UV protective and antimicrobial agents, binder and biodegradable pots for transplanting of plants, and so on. Life-cycle assessment has also been explored to analyse the environmental performances of different shopping bags. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2015.

In the last few decades, people have become more concerned about their health, hygiene, lifestyle, fashion, comfort, luxury, and wellbeing. Those belonging to economically well-off sections are more often choosing to buy luxurious textiles, not only to exhibit their high social and well-off strata, but also from the compulsion in health and hygienic necessity of the present day. In the production of luxurious textiles, natural fibres like cotton, silk and wool, and man-made fibres, like polyester, acrylic and regenerated rayon (viscose) play important roles. Recently, due to the rapid growth of nanoscience and technology, various organic and inorganic nanoparticles, such as silver (Ag), TiO2, ZnO, SiO2, lignin, and Chitosan have been applied to impart attributes needed for health and hygiene, UV protection, self-cleaned, and skin-care functionalities, both in natural and synthetic textiles. Similarly, various plant molecules, biomaterials and bio-polymers, such as banana pseudostem sap (BPS), grape and mulberry fruit extracts, natural dyes, Chitosan, tulsi, silk-sericin, aloe Vera, honey, almonds, cucumber, and mint have been applied in textiles for improvement in antimicrobial, UV-protective, antioxidant, skin-nourishing, and hydrophilic properties. Natural extracts of jasmine, lavender, Champa sandalwood and such others containing active ingredients like santalols, fusanol, santene, teresantol, benzyl acetate, linalool, linalyl acetate, and benzyl benzoate have also been added in textiles for their mind-refreshing fragrance and for skin nourishing, smoothening of facial lines/wrinkles and providing impetus to immune, nervous, and brain psychological system. The requirement of various attributes for professional clothing like wrinkle-resistance, comfort and self-cleaning of fabric surface have been incorporated in textiles to develop aristocratic, social, religious, business, and ritual party outfit. High value Cosmetotextile and Ayurvastra have also been designed for slimming, moisturising, perfuming, healthy, fresh feeling and curing/healing of many diseases in a holistic approach by taking cue from the traditional knowledge of cosmetics, Ayurveda and clothing science. As these high value textiles are produced mostly from the natural fibres and functionalized using natural products/biomaterials, they can be effectively used for the production of sustainable luxurious textiles. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2015.

Flame retardancy was imparted to a scoured and bleached, proteinous woollen textile by using banana pseudostem sap, an ecofriendly waste agricultural product, at different pH levels. The flame retardancy characteristics of both the control and the treated fabrics were analysed in terms of the limiting oxygen index and the vertical flammability measurement. Thermal degradation and fire retardancy mechanisms were studied using thermogravimetry, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Moreover, the charring mechanism of both the control and the banana-pseudostem-sap-treated fabrics with varying pH was analysed and reported in detail. The wool fabric was also dyed with CI Acid Blue 25 using banana pseudostem sap as well as water as the medium. The fabric dyed with the banana pseudostem sap medium at pH 5.5 showed more colour exhaustion, colour strength, and thermal stability compared with the control wool fabric. The mechanism by which superior fire retardancy and colour strength are imparted to the woollen textile by the application of banana pseudostem sap is proposed. © 2016 Society of Dyers and Colourists.

Banana pseudostem sap (BPS) has been extracted from the outer sheath of pseudostem of banana tree (Musa Cavendish). It looks like colourless clean water immediately after extraction. However, with the passage of time, it slowly turns into a light khaki colour due to the oxidation of phenolic rings present in it. As BPS contains minerals like sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium, it can be used as an energy booster for the sportsmen or as an energy drink for alike applications. It has been reported that the alkaline fraction of BPS can be used as an anticorrosive agent for concrete steel, as it is composed of compounds like inorganic materials, polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase and phenolic aromatic ring. As far as the textile application is concerned, BPS has been used as an active ingredient for natural dye, mordant, UV protective and flame retardant formulation. Connected with the mordanting action of BPS on the cotton fabric, the 50% BPS (mordant) was combined with the 50% B. micratha (natural dye) for getting a level-deep brown shade on the cotton textile. As far as the UV protection is concerned, the BPS dyed fabric showed an ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) value of above 50, which is mainly attributed to the presence of large phenolic compounds in it. Presence of the various metal salts and phosphates in BSP could also improve the thermal stability of the cellulosic, lingo-cellulosic and protein substrates. BPS can also be used for medicinal purpose to reduce blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, skin nourishment and also as an ailment for stings or bites. The present chapter also enlightens us with the recent improvement in fertilizing efficiency during cultivation of onion, spinach and garlic by using BPS as a biofertilizer. BPS can remediate soil and help to increase the yield, nutrient uptake of the leafy vegetables. The present chapter briefly represents the recent glimpse on the valuable textile and non-textile application of BPS in the context of sustainable agriculture, food technology, medicine, cosmetics and textiles. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The flame retardant functionality has been imparted in cellulosic fabric using mixed formulation of banana pseudostem sap (BPS) and boric acid (BA). The extracted sap is mixed with different concentration of BA and applied onto the pre-mordanted bleached and mercerized cotton fabrics at elevated temperature. It is found that BA acts as a strong afterglow and smoke arresting agent, when applied at the concentration of > 2% (w/v). Flame retardant characteristics of both the control and the treated fabrics have been analysed in terms of limiting oxygen index, vertical flammability and temperature generation profile during burning. The (BPS+3% BA) treated cotton fabric sample shows the LOI value of 42 and the specific char length of 14cm after vertical flammability test. The thermal degradation and pyrolysis mechanism are also studied, using both thermogravimetric analysis and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Besides, the charring morphology and mechanism of both the control and the treated fabric is analysed in detail by scanning electron microscopy and FTIR analysis. A char structure model and the mechanism of char formation have also been proposed in the paper. © 2018, National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

Protective textiles are saving human beings from various adverse environmental conditions like fire, heat, bullets, microorganisms, mosquito bites, etc. In connection with flame-resistant textiles, fish DNA, casein, whey protein, and wastage plantbased bio-macromolecules, such as spinach juice, banana pseudostem sap, coconut shell extract, and so on, are well reported as flame-resistant materials on cellulosic, lignocellulosic, and protein-based textile products. Apart from it, different nanobased metal oxides are also very popular because of their fire-retardant efficacy at low add-on percentage. Recently, bulletproof and the stab-resistant textile materials are also capturing the defense market very quickly. Concerning this area, designing lightweight bulletproof materials is the major target for the researchers for its wide application. As regards mosquito-repellent protective textiles, different synthetic-based products and eco-friendly plant-based oils (like citronella, clove, eucalyptus) are explored by researchers for their efficient mosquito- repellent properties. Besides, to evaluate the efficacy of mosquito repellency, cone tests, cage tests, etc., are also developed by research societies. Wastage plant extracts like coconut shell extract, neem, aloe vera, etc., are reported to have excellent microorganism protective efficacy when it is applied on the fabric surface. © 2018 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

Background: Pseudostem is a part of banana plant that looks like trunk which is formed by tightly overlapping leaf sheaths. The main aim of the study is to apply the pseudostem extract on the cotton fabric at varying pH level by pad-dry-cure method and evaluate the comfort properties of the fabric. Materials and Methods: The pseudostem extract was prepared in a grinder. The cotton fabric was treated with banana pseudostem aqueous extract by pad-dry-cure method. The pH of the solution is varied from 6 to 8 by keeping the temperature and time constant. The influence of pH on the comfort properties of the fabric such as air permeability, wickability, and thermal resistivity is studied. Results and Discussion: The fabric treated with pH 6.5 has given better comfort properties. The thermal resistivity of the fabric was improved by 9.24, 7.26, 6.49, and 4.46% than the samples treated with pH 6, 7, 7.5, and 8. No significant influence on fabric wickability and air permeability is found due to change in pH. © 2018 BRNSS Publication Hub. All rights reserved.

Chemical processing of textiles, starting from the preparatory processing to dyeing and finishing, is very important for value addition to them in terms of fashion and function. However, those processes are water, energy and chemical-intensive and more often, the source of serious ecological degradation. Due to the increased global awareness and tougher government legislation to combat environmental pollution in recent years, the demand for natural fibre based textiles dyed with eco-friendly sustainable chemicals/natural dyes as well as finished subsequently with various bio-molecules (both plant and protein based) is gaining academic, research and industrial importance. As a result, dyeing of textiles is being carried out or attempted to carry out using various natural products, like plant and insect-based extracts owing to the presence of inherent coloring compounds in them. More recently, a super-critical dyeing process for the synthetic textiles (especially, the polyester textile) is also getting considerable attention in the sustainability domain of coloration. Since a long time, some of the cottons grown have exhibited attractive natural colors due to the variation of their inherent gene characteristics. Besides, some plant and protein-based bio-molecules reportedly have shown excellent UV protection, antimicrobial, mosquito-repellent, wellbeing and aroma functionality on application to the textiles. Such value-added finishing of textiles have been carried out by using a number of plant extracts, such as neem (antimicrobial), aloe vera (cosmeto-textile), turmeric (antimicrobial), Arjuna (well-being), sandalwood (cosmeto, well-being textile and skin nourishment), Tulasi (antimicrobial), jasmine, and eucalyptus oil (aroma). Cellulosic and ligno-cellulosic textiles being highly flammable in nature, the flame retardancy of such textiles has been improved by using different wastage plant bio-molecules like banana pseudostem sap, green coconut shell extract and such others and also, protein-based bio-molecule (DNA, casein, hydrophobin), nano-based metal oxides and by plasma application of textiles at a suitable atmosphere with polymeric gases like phosphine, etc. All these applications have resulted in production of fire retardant fabrics with minimal add-on of the chemicals, without compromising the quality of the finished textiles. The wash and wear finish of the textiles could be improved by low formaldehyde or zero formaldehyde based resin cross-linkers like di methylol dihydroxy ethylene urea (DMeDHEU), poly carboxylic acid-based resin like butane tetracarboxylic acid (BTCA based formulation), natural soya based resin, etc. Recently, enzyme based textile finishing is also gaining significant consideration in the textile industry, particularly in the areas of bio-polishing of cotton, denim washing and fading. Besides, enzyme-based desizing, scouring and bleaching of the cellulosic textiles are also popular in the industry. The enzyme-based processing has helped to reduce the amount of harsh toxic chemicals, which are conventionally used in the preparatory processing of textiles. More recently, various nano-based, eco-friendly insect and moth-proof textiles have also emerged in the market. So far as the sustainability of the textile processing is concerned, different eco-friendly irradiation techniques like plasma and UV exposure of textiles are helping in adopting energy, water and chemical saving dyeing and finishing processes, for example, self-cleaning, soil-release finish, etc. Very recently, bio-mimic textiles like self-cleaning lotus effect, shark skin-effect and nano gecko-feet textiles are also getting attention of the research community. © 2018 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

This research paper is focused on the dyeing of silk fabrics with a natural dye extracted from Celosia flower and banana pseudostem sap as a biomordant. The dyeing process was carried out by three different techniques i.e. pre-, post-, and simultaneous mordanting method. The effect of dyeing process parameters namely mordant concentration, pH, and temperature on the dye absorption and fastness properties of dyed silk fabric have been investigated for each dyeing method. Optimal values of dyeing process parameters have been categorized based on the highest value of dye absorption in terms of K/S value. Optimum mordant concentration was found to be 18 % for all sets of dyeing methods. The optimum pH was examined to be 4.5, 4.0, and 4.0 and dyeing temperature was 70 °C, 70 °C, and 65 °C for the pre-, post-, and simultaneous mordanting dyeing methods, respectively. The color fastness to light, washing, and rubbing of dyed silk fabrics was investigated. Fastness values of light and rubbing showed fair-to-good fastness level, whereas the color fastness to washing was found to be good to very good. The antibacterial activity of the banana sap mordanted and simultaneously dyed silk fabrics was evaluated. The dyed silk fabric exhibited moderate antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. © 2020, The Korean Fiber Society.

The present study has demonstrated the flame reatardancy effect of Banana pseudostem (BPS) as plant wastes at different concentrations on bleached and mercerized Egyptian cotton fabric made of Giza 90. Alkaline method was used to produce the extract BPS. The cotton fabric after the treatment was found to produce stable natural semi kaki color. Flame retardant properties of both the untreated and the treated cotton fabrics were analyzed in terms of limiting oxygen index (LOI), horizontal and vertical flammability. The control and the treated cotton fabrics were performed using FTIR, thermo-gravimetric analysis, mechanical properties, and color components analysis. The results revealed that the treated cotton fabrics were found to have good flame retardant property of LOI at BPS concentration 10% compared to the control fabrics. In the vertical flammability test, the treated fabric showed flame for a few seconds and then got extinguished. In the horizontal flammability test, the treated fabric showed no flame, but was burning with a propagation rate of 7.5 mm/min, which was almost 10 times lower than that noted with the control fabric. The results revealed that there was no significant degradation in mechanical strengths. Based on the results, the mechanisms of formation of natural color on the cotton fabrics using the proposed BPS treatments have been postulated. © 2020 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC).

Natural fiber crops are gaining more importance to the human beings with respect to their usefulness. Most of the natural lignocellulosic fibers with their unique properties and versatility deserve to be called the “fibers for the future.” In India, there are many unexplored agro-based lignocellulosic fibers and one among them is the maize husk fiber (Zea mays). Researchers have reported the different process line of extraction of cornhusk fiber from the by-product of corn and reported to have low crystallinity and rough surface with hollow cross-sectional area. Cornhusk fiber shows less tensile strength and more elongation compared to popular lignocellulosic fiber jute and cellulosic cotton. Researchers have reported synthesized process of good quality MCC (microcrystalline cellulose) from extracted cornhusk fiber. It also has been documented that its rheological and other physicochemical properties are comparable with commercial MCC. Few research groups have reported literature on the spinning process of corn fiber and the process line of the production of cotton and cornhusk fiber blended yarn. In addition, some of the groups also have been engaged in the dyeing process of corn fiber with synthetic and natural dyes. Recently, one research group has reported the process of making thermal stable corn fiber as it can be useful for making different end products. Connecting with it, they have proposed new method for making eco-friendly thermal stable corn fiber by using banana pseudostem sap, a widely available agro-waste in Asian countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

Banana pseudostems are now recognized as a sustainable raw material with a wide range of applications. Plenty of research attention has been paid to banana pseudostem fiber extraction, characterization, modification, and utilization. Mechanical extraction takes precedence over manual extraction. Surface treatments are employed to modify the surface of a fiber to make it suitable for customized applications. Because of its high cellulose content, good to moderate strength, fineness, fiber length-to-breath ratio, and other properties, banana pseudostem fiber is currently used to make nano and microcrystalline cellulose, activated carbon, green composites, and technical textiles. This review article discusses the manual and mechanical extraction processes of banana fiber, as well as its quality evaluation, morphology, chemical composition, physico-mechanical properties, and various surface modification techniques. © 2023 The Author(s).

A continuous non-limiting soil water supply, or a non-limiting supply from 120 to 180 days after planting, significantly increased (P = 0.01) female flower production of banana cv Robusta compared with continuous soil water stress. Relieving stress after 120 days produced a significantly higher (P = 0.05) average number of female flowers per inflorescence than when adequate water was supplied throughout. Female flower production is positively correlated with the average growth rates at floral initiation and early floral differentiation and with the final pseudostem girth. © 1982, Cambridge University Press.

The yield, plant characteristics (pseudostem height and girth), and relative tolerance to bunch loss of 4 banana varieties (Musa AAA Group, Cavendish subgroup) were studied over 2 crops in the semi-arid subtropics at Carnarvon, Western Australia. The varieties were New Guinea Cavendish, Chinese Cavendish, Hsien.Jen Chiao, and the most widely grown Australian variety, Williams. The marketable yield of Williams was higher (P<0.05) than the mean of the other varieties in the parent crop (70.2 v. 50.7 t/ha) and ratoon 1 crop (65.8 v. 34.4 t/ha). This was the result of lower (P<0.05) bunch loss, about 41% less over the 2 crops, than for the other varieties. Resistance to bunch loss-pseudostem breakage and bunch peduncle snap was not associated with the shorter varieties (New Guinea Cavendish and Chinese Cavendish), but resistance to choke throat was associated with the taller varieties (Williams and Hsien Jen Chiao). © 1992 ASEG.

The influence of windbreak shading was investigated over the plant crop (P) and first ratoon (R1) cycle of bananas cv. Dwarf Cavendish, to quantify its effects on assimilation, phenology and yield in the subtropics. Plants growing under seasonal windbreak shading (late autumn to early spring) were compared with those growing under full sun but under similar windbreak protection. Windbreak shading reduced average photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) by 69%, which in turn reduced photosynthesis rate by 27%, transpiration rate by 38% and stomatal conductance by 40% compared with plants growing in full sun. Pseudostem temperature was 2.1 K lower on plants growing in shade. This led to a reduction in monthly leaf emergence rate and an extended cycle time. An additional extension to cycle time was caused by the extra 3.4 leaves produced before flowering on plants growing under windbreak shading. The decreased photosynthesis of leaves growing in shade was partially compensated for in the P cycle by an extended flowering to harvest interval, resulting in no loss of bunch mass. However, bunch mass was significantly reduced in the R1 cycle, when flower to harvest intervals were similar. The most significant effect of windbreak shading was therefore a cumulative 10.6% extension in cycle time over the two crop cycles. The effect of a longer cycle and reduced bunch mass in the R1, caused by windbreak shading, resulted in an overall reduction of 13% in annual yield per ha, compared with plants growing in full sun.

The absorption of the nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S) by banana (Musa sp.) cv. Prata Anã explants on the basic medium of Murashige & Skoog (1962) supplemented with sucrose (30 g/L) and BAP (3.5 mg/L) were evaluated at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 days after inoculation. The seven treatments were arranged on a completely randomized design with three replicates. The sequence of nutrient absorption by the explants was K > N > Ca ≥ P > Mg ≅ S. The P was the nutrient with the fastest absorption rate and at the 30th day the explants had already absorbed 75% of the P from the medium. The P absorption stopped by the 50th day. The S absorption stopped at the 50th day with 66% of it remaining in the medium. The results suggested a close relationship between these two nutrients. The highest rates of nutrient absorption were observed during the first 20 days of culture. The rhizome, pseudostem and leaves behaved differently to the extraction and accumulation of nutrients.

The experiment was arranged on a completely randomized design with three replications. Concentration of the micronutrients in the medium and in dry matter of the whole propagule and in the rhizome, pseudostem and leaves was also evaluated. Absorption of Mn was approximately constant during all the period of the experiment, while the other micronutrients had their higher absorption observed on the first 20 days. At the end of the experiment concentrations of B, Zn, Mn and Cu in the medium were 52, 61, 77 and 78%, respectively. These results point out that it is possible to reduce the concentration of these micronutrients on the basic medium MS for banana explants culture.

The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development. Host plant resistance offers another promising avenue of control. Numerous resistant clones are known, including Yangambi-km 5, Calcutta 4, and Pisang awak. Resistance is most often through antibiosis resulting in egg or larval failure. Banana breeding is a slow and difficult process. Current research is exploring genetic improvement through biotechnology techniques including the introduction of foreign genes. Neem has also shown potential for control of banana weevil. Studies on the use of other botanicals against banana weevil have failed to produce positive results. Chemical control of banana weevil remains a common and effective method for larger scale producers but is beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers. However, the weevil has displayed the ability to develop resistance against a broad range of chemicals. In summary, cultural control remains the most available approach for resource-poor farmers. A combination of several cultural methods is likely to reduce weevil pressure. Among the methods currently under study, microbial control, host plant resistance and neem appear to offer the most promise.

In an attempt to explain the difference in banana (Musa AAA cv. Grand Naine) plants with poor, regular, and good development, their root stratification and spatial distribution was determined in Costa Rican field conditions. Samples were taken from soil blocks at 0 to 30, 30 to 60, and 60 to 90 cm distances from the pseudostem, and at every 15cm depth, from 0 to 120cm in non-flowering plants that were 180-190cm high. The plant development sites did affect the proportion of fresh thick roots (> 5 mm-d) as follows: 49, 63, and 56% in plants with poor, regular, and good development, respectively. The lateral distribution of thick and fine (1 to 5mm-d) roots and root hairs was affected by the horizontal distance from the pseudostem. The total percentage of roots decreased as horizontal distance increased in any plant development. Soil depth affected the distribution of every flesh root type throughout the soil profile. The total fresh root weight in the excavated area (0-90 cm from the pseudostem and 0-120cm depth) was 0.95, 0.9, and 0.76kg, for poor, regular, and good developed plants, respectively. Therefore, the explanation for regular and good plants more likely was the depth of the root system, which reached up to 120cm deep, while in the poor plants the roots reached only 75 cm deep. Additional studies that relate the root stratification with crop yield are encouraged.

Introduction. A project was undertaken to study the nutrient cycling from Musa mother plants to daughter suckers based on the physiological stages of the mother plant. It also reports on the dependency or competition at critical stages of flowering and fruiting and the combinations of different densities and sucker retention at different physiological stages of the mother plant. Materials and methods. A combination of three spacings and five sucker retention phases formed 15 treatments. 32P was given through injection into the mother plant pseudostem. The experiment was carried out over two years, the first being a rain-fed crop and the second being under irrigated conditions. Results. Differential aspects of nutrient cycling were observed between rain-fed and irrigated crops with regard to spacing. In the case of sucker retention phases, in the first year, it was retention at fruit maturity, shooting and flower bud differentiation stages which showed higher radioactivity recovery whereas, in the second year, it was the early phases of retention which showed significantly higher recovery. In the case of interaction effects, in the first year, the highest recovery was found in various combinations of spacing with the stages of bud initiation and shooting and, in the second year, the maximum recovery observed was in the combination of the closest spacing with the stage of flower bud initiation. In both years, recovery was observed in the border row plants. Conclusion. The study confirmed that activity extruded out from the treated plant and was absorbed by the border plants, revealing that nutrient sharing takes place in banana. This result opens up another concept that banana recommendation should not only be at an individual plant level but at block or plot level also. Hastening and improving the efficiency of nutrient cycling to the sucker is suggested as a future line of investigation. © 2002 Cirad/EDP Sciences.

Introduction. A study was done to compare Gruesa, a local dwarf Cavendish selection, with two other cultivars of the Cavendish subgroup in the open air or under greenhouse conditions in two localities of the Canary Islands. Materials and methods. The trials were set up with the cultivars Zelig, Grande Naine and Gruesa in four plots on the northern slope: one outdoors and three under three different greenhouse covers (one with polyethylene lamina and the other two with different types of mesh), and in one outdoor plot on the southern slope of the island of Tenerife. Morphological, phenological and production characteristics were studied over three productive cycles. Results. Significant differences were found in both plant height (Grande Naine > Zelig > Gruesa) and pseudostem thickness (Gruesa > Grande Naine = Zelig). Each cultivar showed a stable [height:thickness] ratio, remaining the same in all trial conditions. Gruesa cycle length was longer than those of the other two cultivars, emitting more leaves until bunch emergency. Gruesa produced the most hands per bunch and the most fingers per hand. In all cultivars, finger length was directly related to pseudostem height. All three cultivars produced well, with fruits very similar in organoleptic traits. A reduction in cycle length and a slight increase in productivity were observed in the northern plot under the polyethylene cover compared with the plots under other covers and outdoors. Conclusion. Gruesa appears more recommendable than Zelig and Grande Naine for open-air plantations in windy localities. © 2005 Cirad/EDP Sciences. All rights reserved.

Sterility has profound effects on the development of reproductive tissues in members of the Musaceae and limits genetic improvement required to deal with new diseases. Ovules of seeded diploid Musa acuminata (AA) and edible triploids (AAA) from the same cytogenetic group, plus edible triploids containing genomes of the M. balbisiana cytogenetic group (AAB, ABB) and the related genus Ensete sp. were studied to determine the effects of sterility on the growth and development of the ovule and its tissues. Specimens were collected from subtropical and Mediterranean environments in Australia. At anthesis, the ovules of triploid plants were 36% larger than the ovules of diploid plants. The diploid ovules ceased growth shortly after the inflorescence emerged from the pseudostem. In contrast, the triploid ovules continued to grow 7-10 days past anthesis, increasing in size by 70%. All ovules of diploid M. acuminata ssp. had an embryo sac at anthesis, against 97% for triploids. At anthesis the embryo sacs in diploid ovules occupied 2.7% of the nucellus compared with 1.5% in triploid ovules. The embryo sacs did not grow between bunch emergence and anthesis, once formed they maintained the same size. Many embryo sacs were not positioned correctly, flush with the nucellar cap. The diploid M. acuminata ssp. had 75% of embryo sacs correctly positioned against 10% in the edible triploids. The proportion of balbisiana genome (B) did not affect ovule or nucellus size or shape, or cell number across the nucellus. It increased the embryo sac presence 96-100% of ovules. The sterile edible triploid bananas have embryo sacs at anthesis but many are incorrectly positioned, which may contribute to their sterility. The balbisiana genome in the edible triploids was associated with a 2.4-fold increase in the number of correctly positioned embryo sacs and this may contribute to the increased fertility associated with the B genome. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of weed management on banana (Musa AAA cv. Grande Naine) parasitic nematodes was evaluated under Costa Rican field conditions with special reference to their spatial distribution and the damage caused to roots of different thickness classes and their relation to yield losses. Root samples were taken at plant harvest, from soil blocks at 0-30,30-60 and 60-90 cm from the pseudostem, and at every 15 cm depth, from 0 to 120 cm. Weed management neither affected the nematode numbers nor their horizontal and vertical distribution and associated root damage. Differences in Radopholus similis (P<0.0001), Helicotylenchus spp. (P=0.0115) and total nematode populations (P<0.0001) were found in roots of different thickness. The average populations in thick, thin and fine roots were for R. similis 270,666 (57%), 120,401 (25%) and 11,313 (2%); for Helicotylenchus spp. 36,094 (7%), 22,508 (5%) and 8,824 (2%); and total nematodes 390,425 (65%), 145,534 (31%) and 21,177 (4%), respectively. No linear correlations were found between bunch weight and the number and density of nematodes or with their damage. Even though, no statistical difference was found in bunch weight, the manual weed control plot yielded 1.4 kg heavier bunches, which might have important implications for sustainable agriculture. The implementation of weed control by hand chopping may improve the physical, chemical and biological soil properties and reduce soil erosion, temperature fluctuations, evaporation rate, and nutrient leaching, and increase water infiltration. As a consequence of the decrease in herbicide applications, soil and air pollution might be reduced. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In order to identify the effect of burrowing nematodes on the shoots (pseudostem and leaves) of banana plants and to determine whether or not shoot characteristics are associated with plant resistance to nematodes two experiments were conducted in controlled conditions within polytunnels. The banana plants were harvested on three occasions for the measurement of root morphology and biomass. Varieties differed in their resistance to nematodes from resistant (Yg Km5, FHIA 17, FHIA 03) and partly resistant (FHIA 01, FHIA 25) to not resistant (FHIA 23, Williams). Nematodes reduced total plant dry weight at the first harvest in Experiment 1 and by an average of 8.8% in Experiment 2, but did not affect leaf area in either experiment. The ratio of above-ground weight to total plant weight was reduced from 75% to 72% in nematode-infected plants compared with the control plants for all varieties tested in Experiment 1, but was only reduced in FHIA 25 and FHIA 23 in Experiment 2. Varieties differed in above-ground growth. The FHIA varieties had greater shoot weights and leaf area than YgKm5 and Williams. Overall, resistance to nematodes was associated with the partitioning of a greater proportion of biomass to the roots than to above-ground parts. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

Field experiments were conducted in Oahu, Hawaii, to investigate the effects of banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) infection on growth and morphology of banana (Musa acuminata). The time interval between aphid inoculation of BBTV and the initial appearance of disease symptoms (i.e. incubation period) was also determined. Plants infected with BBTV showed a significant reduction in petiole size (i.e. length and distance), plant canopy and height, leaf area, pseudostem diameter and chlorophyll content compared with control plants. Growth differences between virus-infected and control plants were not observed until 40-50 days after the plants were inoculated with viruliferous aphids. Other growth parameters such as petiole width and leaf production were not statistically different between infected and control plants. The incubation period of banana bunchy top disease or appearance of symptoms ranged from 25 to 85 days after aphid inoculation. However, PCR assays provided earlier detection of BBTV in banana plants compared with visual symptoms. © 2008 The Authors.

The results of research on the water relations and irrigation need of banana are collated and summarised in an attempt to link fundamental studies on crop physiology to irrigation practices. Background information on the ecology of the banana and crop development processes, with emphasis on root growth and water uptake, is presented, followed by reviews of the influence of water stress on gas exchange (stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration), crop water use, and yield. Emphasis is placed on research that has international relevance and, where appropriate, three geographical areas (the tropics, subtropics and Mediterranean climates) are considered. Although roots can extend to depths of 1.0-1.5 m, the effective depth of rooting is usually taken to be 0-0.40 m, sometimes extending to 0.60 m. Stomatal conductance is a sensitive measure of soil water availability and plant water status, whilst transpiration rates can be limited by dry air (saturation deficits &gt;2.0 kPa). In the subtropics, there are seasonal differences in the crop coefficient (Kc) with values ranging from 0.6 in the winter months to about 1.0 Epan in the summer. It is difficult to draw generic conclusions with wide applicability from the irrigation experiments as they were reported. All the components of marketable yield can be enhanced by irrigation whilst applying insufficient water delays crop development. Annual yield responses to irrigation are variable, but water use efficiencies of 40 kg ha-1 mm-1 (fresh fruit/water applied) have been achieved in the tropics and subtropics (and elsewhere up to 80 kg ha-1 mm-1 with partial replacement of the soil water deficit). To ensure large yields of (marketable) fruit, soil water deficits must be kept low (Ψm &gt;-20 kPa at 0.2 m depth). In the subtropics, this means irrigation intervals should not exceed 2-3 d during the summer. The cooling effect of irrigation with micro-sprinklers on the soil and pseudostem temperatures, compared with drippers, can delay crop development and reduce annual yields by 30%. There is some (limited) evidence that the presence of the B genome contributes to drought tolerance. Yield response factors to irrigation for different growth stages have yet to be confirmed. Opportunities to improve the water productivity of the many, diverse banana cultivars need to be explored further. © Cambridge University Press 2009.

The banana tree demands large quantities of fertilizers to maintain its nutritional requirements and achieve high productivity, but large percentage applied are not available, since it gets lost mainly by fixation, leaching and volatilization. The objective of this study was to evaluate the rate of remobilization and repartition of nutrients in banana tree, cultivar Thap Maeo, cultivated in the Western Amazon. The results showed that the highest proportion of K, Na, Mg, S, B, Cu, Fe and Zn was found in the pseudostem. The remaining flowers represent a strong drain of nutrients. The biomass that comes from the culture residues represents a significant source of nutrients. The nutrient remobilization index was higher with N and K. The inverse was observed with Fe and Mn.

Banana, an important fruit crop, requires high amounts of N-fertilizers for commercial cultivation. This, however, is costly and can be hazardous to the soil environment when used excessively. Biofertilizer is globally accepted as an alternative source of N-fertilizer and can substantially supplement the N requirement while enhancing the uptake of water and mineral nutrients of crop plants. An experiment was conducted to observe the effect of plant growth promoting rhizobacterial inoculation on growth, nutrient uptake of bananas grown under hydroponics condition. The design of the experiment was randomized complete block with five replicates. The following six treatments were imposed: T1 (control; N0-PGPR), T2: (N0+Sp7), T3: (N0+ UPMB10), T4: (N 33%+ Sp7), T5: (N33% + UPMB10), and T 6: (N100%-PGPR). The results showed that inoculation by UPMB10 with minimal fertilizer-N supply increased (P &lt; 0.05) the primary root elongation and secondary root initiation and subsequently increased (P &lt; 0.05) the root biomass. The same treatment also increased (P &lt; 0.05) N concentration in pseudostem and leaves and Ca concentration in roots. The total accumulation of N, P, K, Ca and Mg were increased due to inoculation; a consequence of increased plant growth. Plants with this treatment produced an equivalent total dry matter as those supplied with 100% N. © 2009 Academic Journals.

Under some cultivation conditions, excessive growth of the pseudostem of banana plants can be considered a limiting factor, and thus, the use of growth regulators can constitute a valid alternative. This work aimed to evaluate the action of paclobutrazol on the growth of the pseudostem of banana plants and other characteristics of their development. An experiment was installed with five paclobutrazol doses (0; 0.5; 1.0; 1.5; and 2.0 g of a.i. plant-1) combined with two banana plant cultivars ('Prata Anã' and 'FHIA-01'). Paclobutrazol did not affect the number of days from planting to flowering, total leaf area and leaf emission rate. However, it increased leaf permanence on the plants and sucker number, reduced the foliar area of the leaves emitted after its application and provided an average reduction in pseudostem height of 26%.

To estimate the demand of micronutrients for the banana plants (Musa spp.), it is essential to know the amounts of dry matter and micronutrients accumulated in the plant and exported by the bunch. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accumulation of dry matter and micronutrients by six banana varieties under irrigation. Plants of Grande Naine, Pacovan, Pacovan- Apodi, Prata-Anã, Terrinha and Gross Michel varieties grown in double rows, with a density equivalent to 1,666 plants per hectare were sampled. At harvest four plants of each variety were selected for sampling of mother-plant, which was divided into rhizome, pseudostem, petiole, leaf blade, stalk and fruits. The plant parts were weighed to determine the fresh weight of each part and a sample of about 700 g of each part was collected to determine dry weight and contents of micronutrients. The samples were washed quickly with tap water and later with distilled water and placed in a greenhouse for pre-drying and afterwards conditioned in paper bags were put in an oven of forced circulation of air for obtaining the dry matter and subsequent determination of the contents of B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn. The varieties Pacovan, Prata Anã e Pacovan Apodi accumulated greater amounts of dry matter and micronutrients, when compared to the varieties Grande Naine, Gross Michel e Terrinha, observing the following decreasing order of accumulation and export of micronutrients: Mn > Fe > B > Zn > Cu.

A field experiment was conducted during 2005-07 to find out the relationship between pseudostem cross-sectional area (PCA) with bunch weight, physico-chemical characteristics of banana fruit, dry matter and nutrient content in leaf, pseudostem and fruit of banana. The pseudostem cross-sectional area (321.58, 327.96, 338.31, 344.20, 348.82, 354.14, 365.57, 376.49, 386.18 and 396.70 cm2) were calculated at 30 cm above the ground level. The bunch weight and physico-chemical properties of fruits improved with increasing the pseudostem cross sectional area from 321.58 to 396.70 cm2. Maximum bunch weight (13.22 kg), number of hands and finger (8.2 and 104.65/bunch), TSS (24.97 °Brix), TSS/acid ratio (227.00); leaf, fruit and pseudostem dry matter content (30.50, 27.58 and 9.42% respectively), leaf nutrient content (N-2.21%, P-0.21% and K-2.04% respectively), fruit nutrient (N-1.16%, P-0.079% and K-1.23% respectively) and pseudostem nutrient content (N-0.66%, P-0.042% and K-1.16%) were recorded in plants with maximum pseudostem cross sectional area. Positive and linear relationship were recorded between pseudostem cross-sectional area and bunch weight, number of fingers, TSS and TSS/acid ratio, whereas negative correlation was observed between pseudostem cross-sectional area and fresh and ripe finger weight, peel and pulp weight and fruit acidity. The maximum fresh and ripe finger weight (152.23 and 137.45 g/finger), peel and pulp weight (18.24 and 119.21 g/finger), finger size (14.75 × 4.38 cm) and titratable acidity (0.16%) were recorded with lowest trunk cross-sectional area.

Banana, irrespective of the varieties, respond very well to the applied nutrients and water, especially at the vegetative stage. Although the crop shows vigorous dry matter production in the early stages of growth, the proportion of dry matter partitioning to reproductive growth is inadequate. Most of the dry matter confines to the pseudostem and foliage resulting in poor bunch size, reduced number of fruits and low fruit quality. In the present study, different levels of nutrients were applied to banana 'Robusta' and treatments were as follows: 150:50:150 g NPK plant-1 (M1), 200:50:200 g NPK plant -1 (M2), 250:50:250 g NPK plant-1 (M3) and 300:50:300 g NPK plant-1 (M4) per year as soil application. Bunch treatments comprising spraying of brassinolides 2 ppm (S1), CPPU [1-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-3- phenylurea] 4 ppm (S2), 2,4-D 10 ppm (S3), 0.5% KH2PO4 (S4), 0.5% KNO3 (S5), 0.5% K2SO4 (S6) and dehanding (retaining six hands in a bunch) apart from soil applied nutrients, were also taken up. The experiments conducted in the plant crop revealed that soil application of 300:50:300 g NPK plant-1 and bunch spray of CPPU 4 ppm immediately after last hand opening and 15 days after (M4S2) resulted in heavier bunch (26.2 kg). The estimated fruit yield was 65.50 t/ha in M4S2 with high B:C ratio of 2.62. The improvement in bunch weight and quality parameters might be due to the spraying of chemicals on bunches combined with the increased dose of N and K application. The growth parameters and physiological characters such as soluble protein and chlorophyll content of leaves at the stage of flowering showed significant difference between different levels of fertilizers (M) but not between the bunch spray (S) treatments. However, significant differences were observed in the interaction effects of M and S. Application of 300:50:300 g NPK plant-1 and bunch spray of CPPU 4 ppm immediately after last hand opening and 15 days after (M4S2) resulted in higher TSS (23 °B) and reduced titrable acidity (0.32%), apart from higher bunch weight.

This chapter describes the morphology of the musa plant and discusses the potential benefits of morphological diversity. The East African Highland bananas, also considered as the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, display a very variable pseudostem color, the intensity of which varies with environmental conditions. Thus, in the Lujugira-Mutika subgroup, the pseudostem and leaf petioles tend to get darker as altitude increases. Leaf pigmentation and posture may affect photosynthetic efficiency and transpiration rates as described by Brun and Turner, but there are surprisingly not many recent studies relating leaf morphology to photosynthetic efficiency or transpiration of the existing cultivars. Continued elongation of the main stalk of the inflorescence causes the bunch to hang over, the bracts open and fall, disclosing the female flower clusters or hands. The female flowers undergo further development without being pollinated or fertilized. A comprehensive study of the root system of a wider gene pool is required to construct an ideotype target for genetic improvement of plantains and bananas. © 2011 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Musa spp. is one of the most important fruit crops in the world. Production in Mexico is ranked in the eighth place in the world. Nutrient imbalance is one of the main agronomic problems this species has to deal with. Modern fertilization programs must be designed based on nutrient demand by the cultivated plants, and according to their phenological phase. However, no information is available for 'Dominico', one of the most widespread cultivars in Mexico. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate dry mass and macronutrient accumulation and distribution in banana 'Dominico' during the fruit development phase. This is to determine the amount and timing of fertilizer application. Adult plants were randomly selected in a banana orchard established in Atzalán, Veracruz, México. Root, corm, pseudostem, leaves with petiole, and the bunch were sampled at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after inflorescence emergence (WAIE) on these plants. Samples were processed, and biomass accumulation and N, P, K, Ca, and Mg concentration were determined. Pseudostem was the plant part with the highest dry mass and nutrient accumulation. Potassium was the most extracted nutrient by the plant and the fruit. The sequence for total nutrient extraction per plant was: K > Ca > N > Mg > P. Fruit extraction sequence was: K>N>Ca≥P≥Mg. The highest nutrient extraction was detected at 4 WAIE. The quantity of mineral nutrients that would have to be replenished into the soil will be those extracted by the bunches because they are removed from the plantation. It is recommended that fertilizer applications be split up to the 2 WAIE. This is to guarantee nutrient supply by the 4 WAIE so that an optimum fruit and daughter plant development could be achieved.

Banana is one of the most important food items in the Philippines, ranked fourth among food crops after rice, wheat and maize and being first among fruits. High yield of banana plantations requires enormous amount of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.This study was conducted to determine the potential of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and nitrogen fixing bacteria (NFB) biofertilizers as growth promoters and biological control agents against nematodes in tissue-cultured banana var. Lakatan under screen house conditions. Meriplants were inoculated with AMF (Mykovam™) and NFB (Bio-N™) during planting in individual plastic bags filled with sterile soil sand mixture. Plant parasitic nematodes, Radopholus similis and Meloidogyne incognita suspension were poured into the soil, two months after inoculation with biofertilizers at concentrations of 1,000 and 5,000 larvae or eggs per seedling, respectively. Plant height, pseudostem diameter and leaf area were taken every 2 weeks. At fourth month, the plants were harvested and extent of damage due to nematodes and the number of colony forming units of NFB were determined. Results show that AMF and AMF+NFB inoculated seedlings grew better than the control plants. AMF treated plants were taller, had bigger pseudostem diameter, larger leaf area, highest fine, coarse root and total plant dry weights than the control and the other treatments. Growth of plants infectedwith R. similis alone was comparable with M. incognita and the control. M. incognita-infected plants had numerous root galls. Root necrosis were observed only in R. similis-infected plants. AMF reduced root galls by 33% relative to those inoculated with M. incognita. Percent mycorrhizal colonization was not affected by either NFB or the nematodes. The roots of AMF+NFB gave the highest bacterial colony count (8±1.02 × 10 4 ) which was reduced by AMF+NFB+R. similis (5±0.80 × 10 3 ) and the lowest was with AMF+NFB+ M. incognita (5± 0.50 × 10 3 ). This implies that M. incognita and R. similis reduced the NFB bacterial colonies.

The objective of the present study was to estimate the phenotypic correlations between the number of fruits per bunch and 22 characters evaluated in banana (AA) diploid hybrids. The experiment was carried out at Embrapa Cassava and Fruits in randomized blocks with four repetitions and 11 (AA) banana diploid hybrids were evaluated. The following characteristics were evaluated: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of suckers, number of leaves during flowering, plant cycle until emission of the bunch, presence of pollen, bunch and rachis weight, yellow Sigatoka at bunch emission, number of leaves at harvest, yellow Sigatoka at bunch harvest, number of days from emission to harvest, length and diameter of stem, weight of second hand, number of hands and fruits per bunch, pedicellum fragility, length and diameter of fruit and length of pedicellum and presence of seeds. Correlation studies between the number of fruits and the other plant characteristics were carried out. These correlations varied between genotypes; therefore, it was observed that the associations between number of fruits and vegetative characteristics of plants were, in general, non-significant. However, the relationships between the number of fruits per bunch and the other production characteristics were predominantly significant.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the response of irrigated 'Prata Anã' banana (AAB) to soil application of phosphorus, in four production cycles. The experiment was carried out in the semiarid region of the north of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in a clayey Oxisol, with very low available P (4.6 mg dm-3, Mehlich). A randomized complete block design was used, in a 5x4 factorial arrangement, with five doses of triple superphosphate (0, 50, 100, 200, and 300 g P2O5 per plant per year), four production cycles, and four replicates. In the first cycle, the soil application of P increased plant height, pseudostem diameter, weight and number of fruits per bunch of banana; however, banana plants did not respond to P application in the second, third, and fourth cycles. 'Prata Anã' banana, even when grown in soil with low P content, responds to the application of this nutrient only in the first production cycle.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of different water depths on the morphophysiological and yield variables of three Terra-type banana cultivars. A randomized complete block design was used, in a factorial arrangement with 12 treatments and three replicates. Treatments consisted of water depths correspondent to 33, 66, 99, and 120% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc), besides the control without irrigation, and of the cultivars Terra Maranhão, Terrinha, and D'Angola. The morphophysiological variables evaluated were: plant height, pseudostem diameter, leaf area, stomatal conductance, and, during harvest, the number of fingers and hands, and hand weight per bunch. Crop coefficients of the Terra-type banana cultivars were obtained from the best combination of yield and water use efficiency. The consumptive water-use depths of 1,599 mm (1.20 ETc), 922 mm (0.84 ETc), and 940 mm (1.06 ETc) correspond to the maximum yields and water use efficiencies of the cultivars Terra Maranhão, Terrinha, and D'Angola, respectively.

Dessert banana production worldwide is based on just a few highly productive, easy to grow and international market compatible cultivars from the Cavendish sub-group (AAA genome). However, these cultivars are hampered by pests and diseases, which has led to extensive pesticide use. New pest and disease resistant varieties that are productive enough to meet international market demand are now needed to reduce pesticide use and thus the detrimental environmental impact. Hybrid bananas bred by the CIRAD banana breeding program are resistant to many diseases, particularly Sigatoka diseases, but exhibit morphological traits and yield components which differ markedly from those of Cavendish bananas. After an analysis of traits related to plant morphology and yield in 530 banana hybrids, the effects of modifying the level of competition between bunches and suckers through sucker pruning management practices were compared on the new hybrid CIRAD 925 and on a reference variety from the Cavendish sub-group ‘Grande Naine’. Hybrids from the CIRAD banana breeding program tend to have thin stems, small bunches and a short crop cycle. Total sucker pruning until mother plant harvest significantly increased the fruit diameter, first cycle bunch weight, second cycle duration and decreased the plant size. However, the effect on bunch weight was greater for Grande Naine, while the effects on second cycle duration and pseudostem girth were greater for CIRAD 925. The level of apical dominance of the central meristem on suckers seemed to explain the varietal differences in the effects of sucker pruning management. Our results showed that traits related to plant morphology and yield components could be modified by sucker pruning management and that a tailored management of mother-plant/sucker competition could be a way to improve the suitability of new hybrids for the banana industry. © 2016

A field experiment was conducted to assess the nutrient uptake pattern and partitioning of nutrients in Ney Poovan banana (AB) at critical growth stages like 10-leaf stage, 20-leaf stage, shooting stage and harvesting stage. From 10-leaf stage to harvesting, the per cent dry matter (DM) accumulation decreased from 42 to 16 in underground segment and increased from 58 to 84 in above ground segment. The sample was partitioned into root, corm, pseudostem, leaf lamina, petiole, peduncle, bunch and male bud, processed and analysed for macro and micronutrients at different critical growth stages. The nutrient accumulation pattern, with respect to dry matter production was worked out. To produce 37.5 t banana ha-1, about 444 kg N, 69 kg P, 933 kg K, 2.4 kg Cu, 7.3 kg Mn, 3.4 kg Fe and 5.9 kg Zn were taken up by Ney Poovan banana. About 10 to 52% removal occurred through bunch harvest from the total nutrient uptake from the soil and remaining nutrients accumulated in the residual tissues were available for in situ recycling. The data provided opportunity for proper fertiliser scheduling to achieve optimum yield with higher nutrient use efficiency and nutrient budgeting in banana ecosystem was also done. © 2018, Horticulture Society of India.

The treatments included graded levels of K (@ 390g as control, 450g, 500g, 550g and 600 g/plant) and foliar spray of Sulphate of Potash (SOP @1.5 % twice at 15 days interval after bunch emergence along with four levels of K excluding control). The growth, flowering and quality parameters were periodically observed. In general, increase in graded level of K application has enhanced the growth and yield parameters. Treatments with foliar application of SOP showed significant influence when compared with soil application of K alone. Further, the results revealed that the growth characters viz., pseudostem height, pseudostem girth, number of leaves per plant were favorably enhanced by the combined application of K @ 550 g/plant + SOP foliar spray twice @ 1.5%, which was followed by K @ 600 gm/plant + SOP foliar spray twice @ 1.5%. The yield parameters viz., days to bunch harvest, number of fingers per bunch, number of hands per bunch, weight of second hand per bunch, total number of fingers in second hand per bunch, bunch weight and estimated yield were also found to be influenced by foliar application of K. Among the treatments application of K @ 550 gm/plant + SOP foliar spray twice @ 1.5% recorded the maximum values for all above said characters. The quality parameters viz., middle finger length (cm) and middle finger diameter (cm) of the second hand, TSS and total sugars were also found to be influenced by foliar application of K. The results suggested that application K @ 550 gm/plant + SOP foliar spray @ 1.5% twice at 15 days interval after bunch emergence as the best treatment to increase yield and quality of Hill banana var.

Managing seasonal production variations is sometimes necessary for banana plantations. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a modified pruning, with selection of later successor suckers for the production units, on the growth, harvest time, and bunch weight of 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana plants, when compared to conventional pruning. A completely randomized experimental design was used, with two treatments and ten replicates for the conduction of two experiments, one for each cultivar. The treatments consisted of conventional pruning and modified pruning (selection of later successor suckers). Conventional pruning was carried out maintaining the successor sucker (daughter plant), whose growth was evaluated until the flowering stage. Modified pruning was carried out with the removal of the successor sucker (daughter plant) after the flowering of the mother plant, and the subsequent successor sucker (granddaughter plant) was selected and grown as the daughter plant. The growth of the first and second suckers were quantified at intervals of approximately 60 days and the bunch weight and other production variables were determined. The pruning reduced the height and pseudostem perimeter of the first successor sucker and delayed the harvest time in at least 30 days without reducing bunch weight of both banana cultivars. The mean yields were 26.68 and 50.64 Mg ha-1for the 'Prata' and 'Nanica' banana, respectively, regardless of the pruning management used. The second sucker of 'Nanica' banana presented a residual effect of the pruning on plant height, but not on production. The use of the modified pruning is feasible for changing harvest time of both cultivars. However, repeatedly use of this technique for the same production unit is not recommended, since it affects the h eight of the second successor sucker. © 2021 Federal University ofPiauI.
