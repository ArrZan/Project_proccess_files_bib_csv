Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the firm-level drivers of competitiveness of the Czech small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) using the complex firm-level competitiveness index. The authors explored the relationship between firm competitiveness and firm characteristics such as size, age, industry affiliation and location. Design/methodology/approach The complex competitiveness index as a proxy for firm competitiveness was calculated from the survey data. In total, 132 complete questionnaires filled in by representatives of randomly selected Czech SMEs were collected in 2018. Additional firm characteristics (size, age, industry affiliation and location) considered as determinants of competitiveness were obtained from the commercial database Albertina and from the Czech Statistical Office. The determinants of competitiveness were tested econometrically by estimation of multivariate regression models. Findings The authors mainly found a significant relationship between the firm size and competitiveness of the Czech SMEs. The authors have also confirmed that the least competitive enterprises are those operating in the agricultural sector and that regional location plays an important role in the determination of firm competitiveness. Practical implications The identification of competitiveness drivers can provide entrepreneurs, managers and policymakers with important implications. It seems beneficial for the Czech SMEs to expand the scope of operations to achieve a larger company size, for example, by focussing on investment activities, direct marketing, improving entrepreneurial skills or by applying an aggressive sales strategy, especially towards markets with lower competition. Politicians may respond to these efforts by setting the appropriate policies that promote SMEs' competitiveness, for example, through the hard and soft public support for financial and human resources. Originality/value Although many studies on competitiveness have been published, there is still a limited number of firm-level studies looking at competitiveness from multiple angles rather than from the study of profitability and productivity. In contrast, the study uses a complex firm-level competitiveness index based on ten competitiveness pillars (technology, human capital, products, domestic market, networks, international markets, online presence, marketing, decision making and strategy) to capture the contribution of different resources and capabilities to firm competitiveness.},

Abstract = {Purpose Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in sustainable development. Indeed, national and international governments call for urgent transformations into sustainable development, where firms are affected and affecting this situation. However, recent evidence has shown that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) present low interest, commitment and maturation levels on sustainability; they seem to neglect and question the actual impact of transforming sustainability as a priority in their operations. Thus, this paper aims to measure the impact of sustainability on competitiveness in SMEs. Design/methodology/approach This is empirical research on sustainability and competitiveness in SMEs with a quantitative approach through structural equation modeling. Three hundred twenty-five surveys were applied to SMEs' manufacturing, construction, trade and services, operating in Mexico. Before measuring variables' multiple correlations, tests were carried out to establish the validity and reliability of the model. The data collection, validation and analysis were carried out with statistical package for social sciences and analysis of moment structures. Findings The results indicate a significant positive effect of SMEs' sustainability on competitiveness. The adjusted measurement model shows validity and reliability through the various tests applied. Thus, firms should not view sustainability as detrimental to their competitiveness. Originality/value Because firms are crucial in the urgent sustainability transformation, recent research has shown their low commitment and maturation to sustainability. This research's originality empirically measures and demonstrates sustainability's impact on SMEs' competitiveness. Therefore, empirically testing this impact becomes essential and original to provide better insights into SMEs' needs to be uncovered, prioritied and done in their specific and evolving contexts.},

Abstract = {Labor shortages have become widespread in Slovakia in recent years. Numerous studies deal with the difficulties of finding a skilled, motivated workforce and the difficulties of retantion. The aim of this study is to introduce the tools used by managers in HR with special regard in examining the efforts companies make to prevent burnout. The study provides a statistical analysis of the results of primary data collection on a sample of 431 SMEs the current employment policy issues in Slovakia, with a particular focus on recruitment, motivation and retention. SMEs are the engine of the European Economy, which is why it is very important that this machinery works well, is able to produce continuously and thus contribute to the economic development of the country. One of the prerequisites for this is that the human resources available to them are properly managed. Our goal is to showcase the opportunities and tools that a manager or HR department uses when it comes to employing a company, and to try to find a solution for the problem of retaining an effective workforce. Based on the obtained data related to burnout syndrome, we can conclude that 76.38% of the surveyed companies address the issue of employee burnout. 86% of the employees are at risk of burnout, since burnout is the diesease of our modern civilization. 68% of the companies struggle with more than a 15% workforce fluctuation, which can be declared a loss for the company.},

Abstract = {The importance of business models for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in terms of their competitiveness and sustainability is undoubtedly growing. The global Covid-19 pandemic even strengthens this trend. The degree of digitalization of corporate processes becomes the SME stability and development limitation. The paper submitted presents the results of research focused on the issue of digital transformation of business models on a test sample of 496 SMEs (out of which 214 operate in the manufacturing sector and industry and 218 are included in the services sector) using the method of dimensionality reduction and logit regression. The main output from the solution valid for both tested sectors is considered insufficient setting, management and evaluation of corporate processes. This applies to the main value-creating processes (input and output logistics, production, marketing and sales, service and other ancillary services) and supporting processes (purchase, scientific and technological development, human resources management and company infrastructure). In terms of the achieved degree of process digitization, an imbalance was found between the main value-creating processes and supporting processes. Investment in value-creating and supporting corporate processes are not considered an important factor for any of the sectors due to the high sensitivity of investments to the size and specialization of companies. In contrast, the higher perceived need for value chain digitization in both tested sectors, especially in the case of manufacturing and industry, is considered a very positive output. This proves the need for the digital transformation of companies and its positive impact on their profitability and competitiveness.},

Abstract = {This article's objectives are to analyze the trends related to knowledge management process in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and to compare these findings with the conclusions of other research studies designed for SMEs and to examine the level of formality in knowledge management processes according to the size of enterprise. As well, to propose a model suited to the characteristics of the small business. The information is collected from 22 Basque Country SMEs grouped into industrial clusters, through a survey that is conducted to identify the use of practices related to knowledge management. Results show that informal practices figure prominently in the day to day of the SME and that the knowledge management process is not standardized but that is performed by the collaborative work between people, among others. Besides, the size of the SME acts as a factor in regard to the level of formality in knowledge management process. This study helps SME managers understand where the organizational knowledge is found within organizations and, consequently, to not neglect the importance of people in keeping competitiveness high. The article provides new information on how firms located in a particular region of Spain perform in relation to knowledge management, and it could be considered a sort of benchmarking practice on the behavior of SME in managing knowledge, which will be useful for the organization when taking management decisions.

Abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this study is to relate the practice of organisational learning in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to the organisational life cycle (OLC), contextualising the differential aspects of an integrated relationship between them. Design/methodology/approach – It is a mixed-method study with two consecutive phases. In Phase I, 30 Hong Kong SMEs identified through theoretical sampling were classified into three life-cycle stages – inception, high growth and maturity. In Phase II, their employees’ learning practices (grouped by learning levels) were statistically compared using the analysis of variance and then followed up for confirmation with qualitative semi-structured interviews. Findings – This study uniquely suggests the nature of a relationship between SME organisational learning and the OLC. Empirical results show that three of the four learning levels (individual, group, organisational and inter-organisational) practised in SMEs are varied in importance between life-cycle stages. Research limitations/implications – Comparative studies are encouraged in other parts of the world to strengthen the findings – with either SMEs or large organisations. Practical implications – The study informs SME owner/managers about what is important for employee learning at different business stages so that appropriate learning strategies or human resource development policies can be formulated in a timely fashion to promote competitiveness. Originality/value – It is among the first studies to connect SME learning with organisational growth. The relationships found serve as a sound foundation for further empirical investigations. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Abstract = {Despite the heated debate on the Information Technology (IT) investment–performance paradox, the resource-based view (RBV) has received relatively little attention as an approach to explain such phenomena, particularly in the small and medium enterprise (SME) and e-commerce context. This study draws on the RBV perspective to empirically examine the association between SME e-commerce investments and firm performance. We collected firm-level data from 430 British SMEs across 16 industry sectors. Results demonstrate that RBV provides strong theoretical support, that is, business resources, human resources, and external resources (i.e. e-commerce readiness) strongly contribute to enhanced firm performance. The sophistication of SMEs' e-commerce websites contribute to firm performance, but those firms' capital investments in IT and e-commerce training per se are not significant performance drivers. Our findings suggest that UK SMEs can and do differentiate themselves on the basis of their e-commerce capability, which is created by the synergistic combination of e-commerce resources with other organisational resources and capabilities. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

Abstract = {Purpose – Globalization of markets and increasing expectations of customers have created a turbulent environment for Indian organizations. The purpose of this paper is to study the development of various competencies by small-, medium- and large-scale Indian organizations under various pressures and constraints. Design/methodology/approach – For collecting data, a questionnaire-based survey were conducted. Out of 241 responding organizations, 193 were small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and 48 were larger organizations. Statistical analysis of data acquired from the survey are done by reliability test, t-test and correlation analysis. Findings – Introduction of new technology and identification of market changes have emerged as most important competencies because they are significantly correlated with subjective performance, objective performance and overall competitiveness of organization. Levels of focus given on competencies development by large organizations differ significantly from SMEs. Research limitations/implications – Findings of the study imply that SMEs should be as proactive as large organizations in making changes in terms of various processes such as development of competencies, human resources, upgrading of technology and awareness about market changes. For validating these results, further case studies are recommended. Originality/value – This study will help organizations in shaping their competitive strategies for developing competencies as per the market needs. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Abstract = {Background and purpose: Recent reviews of the human resource management (HRM) literature continue to position knowledge management and intellectual capital as the key determinants for competitiveness, productiveness and organizational performance. This article explores the nexus between knowledge-based HRM practices, knowledge management capacity, intellectual capital, product and process innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Design/Methodology/Approach: Data were gleaned from 250 registered SMEs in Jordan using a simple random sampling technique. A covariance structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) was deployed in testing the proposed research model. Results: The findings cast light on the positive influence of knowledge-based HRM practice of SMEs on SMEs knowledge management capacity, intellectual capital and, product and process innovation. Similarly, knowledge management capacity SMEs exerts positive impact on their intellectual capital and, product and process innovation. Intellectual capital also emerges as a strong predictor for SMEs product and process innovation. Finally, a serial indirect effect (mediation) of knowledge management capacity and intellectual capital on the relationship between knowledge-based HRM practice of SMEs and, product and process innovation were revealed. Conclusion: Knowledge-based HRM practices and innovation have received vast amount of research attention, yet there is a lack of understanding on the process by which the former leads to the latter. Drawing on knowledge-based view (KBV) theory, this study is among the first attempts to unveil the structural process between knowledge-based HRM practices and innovation through knowledge management capacity and intellectual capital. This study theoretically validated the KBV framework in a non-Western context and demonstrate the importance of knowledge-based HRM practices for SMEs innovativeness. The findings do not only provide useful insights for managers and scholars, but also serve as the building block for future research. © 2019 Mohammad Jaber Yousef Al-Tal et al.},

Abstract = {Most business enterprises are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and many of them are without a human resource and recruitment department. Thus, one of the challenges that organizations currently face is to find a strategy to retain and attract talent. To overcome this difficulty, enterprises must invest in employer branding policies and be aware of the factors that differentiate them from others when attracting employees. This study aims to develop an employer branding model applicable to SMEs, to increase and enhance the attraction and retention of talents. An exploratory approach based on a quantitative perspective was adopted to develop an employer branding model applied to SMEs, with two major reference employer branding models and frameworks used as the main support. The model of employer branding was applied to SMEs regarding four dimensions, whereby essential questions are asked, namely (1) organizational culture (e.g., do employees have a job description aligned with the corporate culture?), (2) company strategy (e.g., what is the strategy if business volume decreases?), (3) company reputation (e.g., how do you perceive and treat negative feedback?), and (4) reward systems (e.g., do you feel that your employees are motivated intrinsically or extrinsically or both?), ordered by layers based on a logical sequence. The new proposed model is expected to serve as a useful strategic tool and as a basis for attracting, retaining and managing talent, specifically in the SMEs context. This new model provides a set of strategic and competitiveness benefits for SMEs, while contributing to making enterprises more profitable. The model also contributes to SMEs having a better image and reputation, enabling them to stand out from others in the war for talent. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Abstract = {This article's objectives are to analyze the trends related to knowledge management process in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and to compare these findings with the conclusions of other research studies designed for SMEs and to examine the level of formality in knowledge management processes according to the size of enterprise. As well, to propose a model suited to the characteristics of the small business. The information is collected from 22 Basque Country SMEs grouped into industrial clusters, through a survey that is conducted to identify the use of practices related to knowledge management. Results show that informal practices figure prominently in the day to day of the SME and that the knowledge management process is not standardized but that is performed by the collaborative work between people, among others. Besides, the size of the SME acts as a factor in regard to the level of formality in knowledge management process. This study helps SME managers understand where the organizational knowledge is found within organizations and, consequently, to not neglect the importance of people in keeping competitiveness high. The article provides new information on how firms located in a particular region of Spain perform in relation to knowledge management, and it could be considered a sort of benchmarking practice on the behavior of SME in managing knowledge, which will be useful for the organization when taking management decisions. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to provide a prologue to the issue of human resource development (HRD) and innovation which has been under-researched despite the widespread recognition of the critical role of innovation for sustained national, regional and organisational competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach – The paper provides an overview of the evolution of innovation within the economic and management literatures. It then examines previous work on human resource management (HRM), HRD and innovation. The paper then provides a brief overview of the articles for this issue focussing on HRD and innovation. Findings – HRD interventions can positively contribute to organisation's innovation activities. HRD is also found to positively influence employee engagement, leadership, manager's motivation to learn, the promotion of a learning culture, and social capital development all of which are positively associated with innovation. Informal HRD and access to mentors and coaches is shown to be critical for innovation in SMEs. Originality/value – This paper provides an introduction to this special issue on HRD and innovation. It shows that this has been an under- researched area and it also emphasises that HRD and its relationship with innovation must be analysed within the context of the organisation's culture, its context, and its leadership capabilities. The four conceptual contributions provide a rich road map for future research on HRD and innovation. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

Abstract = {Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are one of the principal driving forces in the development of an economy because of its significant contribution in terms of number of enterprises, employment, output and exports in most developing as well as developed countries. But SMEs, particularly in developing countries like India, face constraints in key areas such as technology, finance, marketing and human resources. Moreover these SMEs have been exposed to intense competition since early 1990s because of globalization. However, globalization, the process of continuing integration of the countries in the world has opened up new opportunities for SMEs of developing countries to cater to wider international market which brings out the need for these SMEs to develop competitiveness for their survival as well as growth. It is observed from literature that pursuing appropriate IM practice is one of the ways of acquiring competitiveness among others, by effectively managing and minimizing inventory investment. Inventory management can therefore be one of the crucial determinants of competitiveness as well as operational performance of SMEs in inventory intensive manufacturing industries. The key issue is whether Indian SMEs pursue better IM practices with an intension to reduce their inventory cost and enhance their competitiveness. If so, what are the IM practices pursued by these enterprises? What are the factors which influence the inventory cost and IM performance of enterprises? These questions have been addressed in this study with reference to machine tool SMEs located in the city of Bangalore, India.},

Abstract = {Innovation is the pillar of competitiveness of small and medium-sized exporting companies. This research aims to examine the incidence of technology, human resources and management with innovation in these exporting companies. The research approach is quantitative, the method is deductive, the type of research is correlational, with a non-experimental and cross-sectional design, using a sample of 126 exporting companies from the province of Guayas- Ecuador. The data processing was through factorial analysis and subsequently a linear regression was performed. The results show that technology and management have a positive impact on the innovation of small and medium-sized exporting companies, where management is mainly oriented towards resources, skills and knowledge to achieve innovation. The research provides the literature with empirical evidence of these relationships since previous studies have focused on the export success of this type of company or on examining their innovation without focusing on the exporters. It is concluded that it is important for the administrators of these exporting companies, because through increasing technology and management in these companies, their innovative potential is increased © 2022.

Abstract = {In the digital era and the era of the industrial revolution 4.0, the quality of human resources needs to be improved in order to have competencies that are in accordance with the needs of the organization. Therefore, an effective and efficient method is needed to improve employee competence by using elearning technology. This study analyzes the Diffusion of Innovation Theory through the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The study uses quantitative data obtained by surveying 400 SME employees in Indonesia using an e-learning system. Dissemination of data is by using online questionnaires through social media. Data analysis uses structural equation modeling (SEM) modeling. The results of data analysis show that the theory of diffusion of innovations mediated by intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in the UTAUT model had a significant effect. The aspects that make up the theory of diffusion of innovation significantly and directly affect the intention of SMEs employees to use the e-learning system. The findings show that the diffusion of innovation theory has various indicators for the application of learning systems and further elearning development so that they can have a real and significant impact on improving organizational performance and competitiveness. © 2022 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.},

Abstract = {Labor shortages have become widespread in Slovakia in recent years. Numerous studies deal with the difficulties of finding a skilled, motivated workforce and the difficulties of retantion. The aim of this study is to introduce the tools used by managers in HR with special regard in examining the efforts companies make to prevent burnout. The study provides a statistical analysis of the results of primary data collection on a sample of 431 SMEs the current employment policy issues in Slovakia, with a particular focus on recruitment, motivation and retention. SMEs are the engine of the European Economy, which is why it is very important that this machinery works well, is able to produce continuously and thus contribute to the economic development of the country. One of the prerequisites for this is that the human resources available to them are properly managed. Our goal is to showcase the opportunities and tools that a manager or HR department uses when it comes to employing a company, and to try to find a solution for the problem of retaining an effective workforce. Based on the obtained data related to burnout syndrome, we can conclude that 76.38% of the surveyed companies address the issue of employee burnout. 86% of the employees are at risk of burnout, since burnout is the diesease of our modern civilization. 68% of the companies struggle with more than a 15% workforce fluctuation, which can be declared a loss for the company. © 2021, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.
