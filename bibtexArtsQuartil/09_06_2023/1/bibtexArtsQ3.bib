Abstract = {Today, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular have to face various challenges due to the accelerating changes of external influences and internal factors. On the external side they have to consider aspects as the ever-changing market requirements and technological advances and at the same time they have to deal with knowledge management and personnel structure to name examples for internal factors. In order to confront this challenge the development of products, processes and technologies has to be at the core of innovation efforts. This task is difficult to implement for most SMEs located in the low-tech sector due to the fact that they seldom have a separate R&D department. Therefore, it is mandatory to design an efficient process for the perception of innovation to ensure the competitiveness on the market.},

Abstract = {The paper analysed factors that has the most impact in influencing the achievement of a sustainable process management model in the implementation of Industry 4.0 concepts within the Czech SME manufacturing sector. Several factors were identified and their interactions with digital technologies within the production environments was analysed. These factors, from an organisational perspective were identified as critical to success in the quest to achieve Industry 4.0 compliance and digital transformation of the manufacturing operations of companies. They include: strategy, organisational fit, competitiveness, operations and human resources. A mixed methods approach was adopted for the research. It involved both the qualitative and quantitative methodological approaches. The qualitative aspect involved an extensive systematic review of relevant literature which was useful in developing the conceptual framework and identifying the relevant factors that enable the implementation of an efficient Industry 4.0 process management model in SMEs; the quantitative aspect involved the use of a survey questionnaire to collect data which was analysed using confirmatory factor analysis statistical approach to test the measures of the constructs in the proposed conceptual framework. The result from the statistical analysis shows the factors that in the conceptual model that were supported as being relevant in achieving an efficient process management model for successful implementation of Industry 4.0 concepts in Czech manufacturing SMEs. The research limitation is based on the fact that the SMEs covered in the quantitative aspect of the research are restricted to a particular geographical location – Czech Republic. It would be interesting to have similar studies conducted in other geographies for a comparative perspective. It contributes to the scientific and practical discourse on Industry 4.0 process management model implementation in SMEs by investigating the phenomenon through the production of credible scientific evidence. © 2020 The Author(s).},

Abstract = {The 21st century is the century of change and maybe one of the most important changes in the organizations' life is the transition from focusing on the development of the tangible assets to the development of the intangible assets and the interest for attracting human resources capable to generate performance. The survival of many companies depends on their willingness and capacity to adapt to such changes. (Abdulaali, 2018) In this dynamic and complex economic system, the intangible assets of organizations become primary, being decisive for the organizations' performance. In the new economic competition, intangible assets provide a sustainable competitive advantage, intellectual capital and intangible assets representing the key factor in company profitability and success. In the knowledge based society, intellectual capital has more value for organizations than tangible assets and knowledge becomes a permanent source of competitiveness (Bhatti, Zaheer, 2014). It is considered by specialists a valuable and strategic resource, since the success of organizations depends on creating, discovering, storing, disseminating, measuring and developing knowledge.

Abstract = {In this paper we address Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as a competitive factor in textile and fashion value chain. CSR assumes a large range of activities focused on one or multiple targets, from work conditions to social programs, or environmental impact. The influence of CSR strategies on market performance depend on how truthful consumers will understand and believe to be the values offered by companies. The qualitative research has considered seven case studies from Portuguese textiles and fashion companies. We have found that a major obstacle to SMEs was the cost of CSR programs and their internal and external communication. As a rule, SMEs have small financial investment capabilities and their human resources tend to be scarce and not available to engage more responsibilities. Moreover, managers argue they compete in the market with companies that have low production as well as low social and environmental costs. If CSR strategies establish a set of clear and transparent practices, consumers will be able to compare across world suppliers, will result in additional costs and clients are not willing to pay for. The development of an accreditation system, able to clearly establish the reality of CSR practices within companies, is an important contribution to the implementation of CSR strategies into the textile and clothing sectors. The researchers have developed a system that can be managed step-by-step, and implemented progressively as companies receive and evaluate market feedback. The system introduces a clear communication about the company's actions and commitment to CSR, resulting in an unique label, capable of stating to whom it may concern, the company' present situation and its development year after year.},

Abstract = {Safety in the sustainable construction is a game with uncertain reality, with human's life. Managers in power, involved in the construction project life cycle, create rules for the game and are the main players. The project's success can be perceived differently by stakeholders. A company's competitiveness, successful implementation of the projects and effective safety management depends on the strategic allocation of its human resources in order to select a proper project team in alignment with employee capabilities. This requires detailed factors reflecting their role (in line with their interests and attitudes) and knowing which of them has a decisive influence on the successful implementation of the project. The real data describing key factors in this concept can be provided as uncertain conditions. This work presents a novel integrated modified fuzzy group decision- making approach to select and rank the most influential persons ensuring the sustainable prevention of accidents at work in the small and medium-sized construction enterprises. This model includes the Delphi method and fuzzy extensions of Eckenrode's criteria rating method. The proposed model could be expanded in order to select the most suitable individuals for sustainable management of safety and, moreover, for the effective implementation of safety and health measures.},

Abstract = {Family businesses are present in every economy, whether they are given special attention or remain a general part of the strategic segment. In Slovakia, despite the dominance of family businesses, not enough attention is paid to them. The main objective of the paper is to identify the key internal determinants that affect the management, sustainability and development of Slovak family businesses. Current information on the researched issue has been obtained through empirical research in practice. The research was evaluated using statistical hypothesis testing methods (Binomial test and Mann-Whitney U test). While verifying the hypotheses, the statistical software STATISTICA 12, was used. The results of the study led to conclusions that extend the current knowledge in family businesses in Slovakia. The achieved results showed that the key internal determinants influencing the development of family businesses in Slovakia are: management, human resources, finances and narrow specialization of the supply, especially on the Slovak market.},

Abstract = {In relation to the problem of SME productivity, it is necessary to investigate whether there is a problem of mismatch between workers and work and groups and corporate cultural values. This study aims to analyze whether the concept of innovative work behavior can mediate the relationship of person-job fit, person-organization fit and person- group fit to job performance. The study was conducted in the metal SME industry in Tegal Regency, with 256 respondents. Data collection tools use questionnaires and interviews. Data analysis is done with a structural equation model. Based on the results of the analysis, there is a positive relationship between variables. This illustrates that the challenges of SMEs in the future are to maintain the best human resources to remain committed to the organization. In maintaining its existence, alignment of individual values with work, organization and groups is the best tool to achieve goals through innovative changes in employee behavior, and also to lay a solid foundation in the recruitment and selection process of new employees that have the potential to increase job performance. © 2020 The Author(s).},

Abstract = {The development of a viable and vibrant Small- and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) sector has been widely recognised as vital for sustaining the process of economic transformation in East and Central Europe (ECE). Owing to the high rate of change in competitive dynamics within transformation economies, SMEs seek to develop new knowledge themselves or, more likely, transfer, adapt and implement new knowledge obtained from outside sources in order to increase their competitiveness. The effectiveness of identifying and transferring new knowledge and best practice depends to an extent on the level of absorptive capacity of the organisation, which, it can be argued, is strongly related to its inherent level of Human Resource Development (HRD). This paper reports the initial results of a research project which investigates the priorities for HRD in SMEs to enable managers to identify, transfer, assess and implement new knowledge gained through access to external sources. The study identifies significant differences between HRD priorities identified by management and the preferences of employees and potential employees in the form of undergraduate business students. The conclusions indicate that firms should consider the importance of both their own and employees' motivational factors in managing knowledge transfer mechanisms.

Abstract = {THe aim of this article is to analyze the satisfaction of the employees of the dressmaking- textile sector exporting SMEs of Barranquilla, Colombia. THe theoretical perspective was mainly oriented from the study made by Robbins and Judge (2009). In this sense, a research based on the quantitative paradigm was developed, with a non- experimental transectional design, for which a census formed by the 19 exporting SMEs of the sector was carried out. THe data was processed by the use of central tendency measures, evidencing that the indicators below the established average are the variety of work, the recognition of performance, safety, permanence, opportunities and relationship with the companions; on the contrary, the indicators referring to salary, structure and labor flexibility, reached the highest levels of satisfaction. It is concluded that the global effects in this sector require the definition of strategies made by Colombian companies, aimed at enhancing job satisfaction, considering human resource as the most important factor in competitiveness. © 2018, Universidad del Zulia.

Abstract = {Human capital is considered to be leading to the growth of innovation and it plays an important role in economic development and firms’ competitiveness. For this reason, the perception of different human resource (HR) risks and establishing a suitable and effective HR risk management system is an up-to-date issue. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the most important sources of HR risks in the V4 countries and to find out the statistically significant differences in the perception of HR risk sources between the V4 countries. To collect the data in the years 2017 and 2018, an online questionnaire was used. To evaluate the intensity of the HR risk sources and to find out the differences between the V4 countries, the methods of Chi-square test and Z-score of P-value were used. The results showed that a high employee turnover rate, insufficient employee qualification, low work morale and discipline are perceived relatively most intensely in Hungary compared to other V4 countries, when “low work morale and discipline” is perceived most intensely out of all four HR risk sources studied. „Employee mistakes” are perceived statistically significantly more intensely in Poland compared to the Czech Republic and Slovakia. © 2020, Czestochowa University of Technology.

Existing skill deficiencies in sales, management and administrative staff are adversely affecting competitiveness in almost a third of those small firms surveyed (Bolden, 2001, 2007). Additionally, attending face-to-face and classroombased development courses is problematic for time-poor SME managers. Thanks to the development of new technologies online learning is becoming commonplace due to wireless and mobile devices, together with the Internet boom, are providing the infrastructure necessary to support the development of new learning forms. Collaborative learning, especially as represented by an action learning approach, would seem ideal for SME managers. But can collaborative learning be adopted as a blanket approach in the case of SME managers? Or should one first take into account the contextual influences on learning, networking and collaboration?

Abstract = {Sustainable manufacturing is a critical phenomenon in the process of creating sustainable value. This is a way to increase innovation and resource quality. On the other hand, the partnership strategy is an important factor in efforts to improve company performance. The involvement of the partnership strategy is one of the factors that strengthen the achievement of sustainable values. Furthermore, this affects the sustainability of a manufacturing company’s competitiveness, including Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). In this study, we focus on creating sustainable value and the role of partnership strategies in improving the business performance of SMEs engaged in the metal manufacturing industry. The Partial Least Squares (PLS) approach to Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is used to evaluate relationships and effects based on survey data from small and medium industries. The results show that the creation of sustainable value, including products, processes, production, equipment, organization, and human values, has a significant impact (β=0.522; ρ<0.001) on increasing the competitiveness of small and medium enterprises. The effect of sustainable value creation on sustainable competitiveness is fully moderated by the partnership strategy (β=0.179; ρ=0.03), especially in the technology & equipment, and human resources. Apart from being a moderating variable, the partnership strategy has also been shown to significantly act as a partial mediating variable (β=0.135; ρ<0.05) for sustainable value creation in enhancing competitiveness. The partnership strategy‘s simultaneous involvement proves that the partnership strategy plays an important role in value creation to increase the competitiveness of sustainable manufacturing SMEs.

Abstract = {High-technology firms are a growing segment of Thailand's economy, and are critical to the innovation economy, but show few signs of adopting strategic human resources management (SHRM) practices that could improve their competitiveness. This research investigated the use of SHRM in Thai high technology firms. It used a mixed methods approach to examine the effect of strategic HRM practices including recruitment and selection, training and development, performance appraisal, compensation systems, and flexible work practices on firm outcomes of product quality, corporate reputation and innovation. It was a quantitative-led approach, incorporating HR interviews and a survey. The quantitative findings were used to evaluate the hypotheses, while the quantitative findings were used to evaluate barriers to SHRM implementation in medium and small firms. Analysis of the quantitative survey of high-tech firms (n = 312) showed that SHRM practices had significant effects on product quality (except for flexible work), reputation (except for recruitment and hiring) and innovation (except for recruitment and hiring and training and development). The strongest effect was on company reputation. ANOVA showed that large and medium firms were significantly more likely to use SHRM than small firms. Qualitative interviews with small firms (n = 10) identified several barriers to SHRM implementation, including lack of time, cost, and expertise as well as preference for traditional hiring practices. The implication of this study is that SHRM does have a benefit to technology firms in Thailand, but that small firms may not be recognizing this benefit. The major policy implication is that the Thai government needs to address knowledge and resource barriers for SMEs in the high-tech industry to enable them to use SHRM effectively. © 2021 Sriwijaya University.

Abstract = {Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are considered engines for economic growth, not only in India but all over the world. They account for 80% of global economic growth. Market conditions have dramatically changed for Indian SMEs after economic reforms. SMEs are regularly facing new challenges in terms of cost, quality, delivery, flexibility and human resource development for their survival and growth. In the context of a dynamic market scenario, they have to formulate their strategies for developing various capabilities and competencies to satisfy their domestic as well as global customers. For long-term competitiveness, SMEs have to focus on all aspects of organisational functions such as assets, strategy development, processes and their performance. This study tries to illustrate this concept with the help of a case study. It is observed that to be competitive, SMEs should have clarity of mission and should proactively develop their human resources and competencies to meet fast changing customer requirements.
