Abstract = {This paper analyses board size and composition determinants with reference to boards' two principal functions: the control or monitoring function and the advisory function. It also tackles the endogeneity problem which exists in this type of studies. Using a sample composed of 171 publically traded Spanish corporations spanning the period 2004-2008, the results show that, in Spain, board size is sensitive to advisory needs (using firm complexity as a proxy for them), while board composition depends to a greater extent on the need for control, determined by the organization's stock structure. The evidence shows that the presence of independent members on the boards of directors in Spain basically responds the objective of guaranteeing an adequate representation of the ownership structure of the company rather than in response to a specific need for counselling.},

Abstract = {External stakeholders rely heavily on the information contained in the financial statements when making business decisions. Given the risks they take in making decisions based on this information, they expect the management to provide them with quality financial statements. In order to be able to provide such financial statements, the company's management needs to establish quality internal control over the financial reporting system. The task of this internal control is to reduce the risks of unintentional errors in accounting records, as well as intentional manipulation of accounting information contained in financial statements. Having in mind the importance of internal control for providing reliable financial statements, the author intends to identify the determinants of the quality of internal control in this article. In order to identify these determinants, the author relies on the results of empirical research conducted in countries where companies are required to disclose information on the quality of internal control over financial statements. According to the author's findings, the quality of internal control is influenced by a number of factors concerning the characteristics of corporate governance and the characteristics of the company in which internal control is established. When it comes to the characteristics of corporate governance, the quality of internal control over the financial reporting system is affected by the quality of the board of directors, the quality of the audit committee and the quality of internal audit. When it comes to the characteristics of the company, the author found that the quality of internal control over the financial reporting system is influenced by the ownership structure of the company, its size, age, financial stability, complexity, growth rate and the fact that the company is in the process of restructuring.},

Abstract = {This study explores how new ventures access advice to achieve high growth and sustainable performance. A relational model of three important themes - compliance (regulatory and legal governance), contacts (networks of suppliers, customers, investors), and content (strategic insights) - emerged as critical to any sustainable high-growth effort. Our findings suggest that advisory boards and boards of directors have a significant role in managing and creating value for emerging high-growth firms due to inherently high failure rates, technological complexity, and market risk - all of which requires access to external resources. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Abstract = {Solvency II leads to a new system of solvency requirements for insurance undertakings based on a risk-oriented approach. Risks have to be covered by own funds of the insurance undertakings. This academic legal paper analyzes and systemizes the new insurance related solvency system according to the Solvency II-directive, the proposed Level 2-Regulation and the proposed new German Insurance Supervision Act (VAG). It focuses then on the three problematic areas under the new solvency regime, i.e. complexity, volatility and procyclical effects. Finally it turns to the new roles, which the boards of directors and supervisory boards of insurance undertakings, the supervisory authorities, the courts and the academics will play in the Solvency II-process. © Springer-Verlag 2012.},
