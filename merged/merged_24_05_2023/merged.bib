abstract={Recent research developments underscore the need for research on the processes that link board demography with firm performance. In this article we develop a model of board processes by integrating the literature on boards of directors with the literature on group dynamics and workgroup effectiveness. The resulting model illuminates the complexity of board dynamics and paves the way for future empirical research that expands and refines our understanding of what makes boards effective.},

abstract={Increased business complexities coupled with enhanced global transformation have propelled corporations to behave as responsible citizens to drive the sustainability agenda. Many corporations incorporate their affirmative commitment to sustainable business practices into their corporate identities and give evidence for this in their sustainability reports. This paper examines the role of the board of directors in sustainability reporting quality (SRQ) in the Asia-Pacific region. Based on a cross-sectional study of 113 companies from 12 countries in the region, we find that the SRQ in the region leaves much room for improvement. However, we find that the institutionalization of the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in an organization provides a sound foundation for enhancing SRQ. We find that the value of CSR anchored in the vision and/ or mission statement and strategic alliances fostered with non-governmental organizations are positively associated with SRQ. This study contributes to strengthening the understanding, promoting discussion on the state of sustainability reporting in the Asia-Pacific context and laying a solid foundation for more aggressive efforts to enhance SRQ. The study identifies the significant drivers currently associated with SRQ. The weak role of the board of directors in upholding the sustainable development agenda through the reporting process is highlighted.

abstract={In recent years, a paradigm shift has occurred regarding the way organizations view risk management. Instead of looking at risk management from a silo-based perspective, the trend is to take a holistic view of risk management. This holistic approach toward managing an organization's risk is commonly referred to as enterprise risk management (ERM). Indeed, there is growing support for the general argument that organizations will improve their performance by employing the ERM concept. The basic argument presented in this paper is that the relation between ERM and firm performance is contingent upon the appropriate match between ERM and the following five factors affecting a firm: environmental uncertainty, industry competition, firm size, firm complexity, and board of directors' monitoring. Based on a sample of 112 US firms that disclose the implementation of their ERM activities within their 10Ks and 10Qs filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, empirical evidence confirms the above basic argument. The implication of these findings is that firms should consider the implementation of an ERM system in conjunction with contextual variables surrounding the firm. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Management compensation is often categorized as either sensitive or insensitive to firm performance. This one-dimensional treatment ignores the variation in the types and terms of compensation contracts. Through a cross-sectional examination of shareholder-authorized compensation arrangements, this paper demonstrates that the terms of stock option and restricted stock plans, and the flexibility afforded the board of directors in negotiating with managers, vary systematically with the characteristics of the assets being managed. This variation in compensation contracting challenges theorists to incorporate the richness of management contracts into models of incentive pay.},

abstract={This paper extends prior research on the relationship between governance quality and auditor remuneration. We examine the influence of audit committee effectiveness (ACE), a proxy for governance quality, on audit fees (AF) and non-audit services fees (NASF) using a new composite measure comprising audit committee independence, expertise, diligence and size. We find that after controlling for board of director characteristics, there is a significant positive association between ACE and AF only for larger clients. Our results indicate that effective audit committees undertake more monitoring which results in wider audit scope and higher audit fees. Contrary to our expectations, we find the association between ACE and NASF to be positive and significant, especially for larger clients. This suggests that larger clients are more likely to purchase non-audit services (NAS) even in the presence of effective audit committees probably due to the complexity of their activities. Overall, our findings support regulatory initiatives aimed at improving corporate governance quality. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Pressure on boards to improve corporate performance and management oversight has led to a series of inquiries and reports advocating governance reform. These reports largely reflect an agency perspective of governance and seek to ensure greater board independence from and control of management. While board independence is important to good governance, we contend that frameworks, models and advice centred on one element of governance ignore the complexity of how boards work. We develop a holistic board framework based upon the concept of board intellectual capital to address this concern. Our framework proposes a series of inputs (e.g. company history, company constitution, legal environment) that lead to a particular mix of board intellectual capital. We contend that the balance of the different elements of board intellectual capital will lead to a series of board behaviours. Further, the board needs to mobilise its intellectual capital to carry out a series of roles. The exact nature of these roles will depend on the company's requirements. Thus, the governance outputs of organisational performance, board effectiveness and director effectiveness will depend on the match between the board's intellectual capital and the roles required of it. We conclude by demonstrating the benefits of this framework as a diagnostic tool. We outline how boards wishing to improve their governance systems can diagnose common governance problems by evaluating their own board's capabilities in relation to the different components of the framework.},

abstract={Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how a risk management committee (RMC), as a newly evolving subcommittee of the board of directors, functions as a key governance support mechanism in the oversight an organisation's risk management strategies, policies and processes. However, empirical evidence on the factors associated with the existence and the type of RMCs remains scant. Design/methodology/approach Using an agency theory perspective, this study investigates the association between board factors such as proportion of nonexecutive directors, Chief Executive Officer duality, and board size; as well as, other firmrelated factors (e.g. auditor type, industry, leverage, and complexity), and the existence of a RMC, and the type of RMC (namely, a separate RMC versus one that is combined with the audit committee). Data was collected from the annual reports of the top 300 Australian Stock Exchange (ASX)listed companies. Findings The results, based on logistic regression analyses, indicate that RMCs tend to exist in companies with an independent board chairman and larger boards. Further, the results also indicate that in comparison to companies with a combined RMC and audit committee, those with a separate RMC are more likely to have larger boards, higher financial reporting risk and lower organisational complexity. Research limitations/implications Data limited to top 200 top ASXlisted companies, thus restricting generalisability of the results. Originality/value The findings of this study provide additional information on the use and design of RMCs in a voluntary setting. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

Through content analysis, a synthesized list of 13 different roles were identified. The study considered institutional and organizational attributes such as environmental uncertainty and organizational complexity to explore the contingencies under which certain board roles become more prevalent. The roles were also matched to existing governance theories. The list not only reflects activities recognized by different theoretical models but also suggests conflicts in the way strategy is conceptualized and articulated as a governance task. © 2010 SAGE Publications.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this research paper is to explore the proposition that diversifying the board in terms of gender, ethnicity or skill base may require consideration of the specific strategic environment of the organisation. The proposition arises from the question as to whether or not greater diversity in board configuration is desirable in certain circumstances and considers the group dynamics, skill mix and capabilities that are required by boards under different conditions of change and strategic complexity. Design/methodology/ approach - The study examines the financial performance of New Zealand publicly listed companies over a five-year period and focuses on changes in board composition, strategic activity and implications for corporate performance. Findings - The study finds limited support for the idea that board configuration, strategic context and corporate decision quality may be linked. Originality/value - This paper will be of particular value to those involved in the appointment of directors within the private and public sectors. In particular, it focuses discussion on the strategic environment faced by the organisation and the relevance of a range of potential selection criteria when appointing new directors. It is also of interest to researchers evaluating the value of social capital and gender equity in contemporary organisations as, based on empirical reseach, it challenges conventional thinking. By implication, the paper also questions whether or not boards are actually able to influence key outcomes in the manner expected by legislators. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Senouf, 535 A.2d 1351, 1354-55 (Del. 1987), the Delaware Supreme Court reiterated this bright-line view: In making that choice, the burden must be upon the stockholder to obtain the advantages of record ownership. The legal and practical effects of having one's stock registered in street name cannot be visited upon the issuer. The attendant risks are those of the stockholder, and where appropriate, the broker (citing Lewis v. Corroon & Reynolds Corp., 57 A.2d 632, 634 (Del. Ch. 1948); Nickles v. United Nuclear Corp., 192 A.2d 628 (Del. Ch. 1963)). See also Am. Hardware Corp. v. Savage Arms Corp., 136 A.2d 690, 693 (Del. 1957); In re Giant Portland Cement Co., 21 A.2d 697 (Del.

Of the sections referred to, § 211(e) permits electronic voting, § 212(c)(2) permits electronic transmission of proxies, and § 211(a)(2)(b)(i) permits participation by remote communication. These provisions were added in 2000; 67 Del. Laws 810 (1990), cited in Seidman & Assocs., L.L.C. v. G.A. Fin., Inc., 837 A.2d 21, 27 n.14 (Del. Ch. 2003); § 231(d) (emphasis added). Up until 1990, Delaware took an even narrower view on what materials may be considered. Under the doctrine of Williams v. Sterling Oil of Okla., 273 A.2d 264, 265-66 (Del. 1971), the inspector could not look to any extrinsic evidence at all. In 1989, in Concord Fin. Group v. Tri-State Motor Transit Co. of Del., 567 A.2d 1, 13 (Del. Ch. 1989), the Delaware Chancery Court reaffirmed the Williams court's refusal to consider extrinsic evidence and held that the inspector erred in considering extrinsic evidence of an obvious clerical error to resolve an outcome-determinative overvote. In response, in 1990, the Delaware legislature amended § 231 to provide the exception discussed in text. See 67 Del. Laws 810 (1990); 837 A.2d 21 (Del. Ch. 2003); Id. at 24, 28; Exchange Act Release No. 38,406, 64 SEC Docket 231, at n.5 (Mar. 14, 1997); Calculated from the NYSE Fact Book, http://www.nysedata.com/factbook (follow Market Activity hyperlink; then follow Daily NYSE Group in NYSE Listed hyperlink) (last visited Nov. 9, 2007); For a discussion of why investors prefer to hold shares in street name, see John C.

Article 8: Transfer of securities in the traditional certificate-based system was a complicated, labor-intensive process. Each time securities were traded, the physical certificates had to be delivered from the seller to the buyer, and in the case of registered securities the certificates had to be surrendered to the issuer or its transfer agent for registration of transfer. As is well known, the mechanical problems of processing the paperwork for securities transfers reached crisis proportions in the late 1960s, leading to calls for the elimination of the physical certificate and development of modern electronic systems for recording ownership of securities and transfers of ownership.

Serv, The SEC's final report states: In Section 17A of the Act Congress directed the Commission to facilitate the establishment of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.

Icahn had a stake of about ten percent in Mylan, both in terms of economic exposure and in terms of voting rights. But Icahn also had shorted 5.3 million shares of King stock. Id. Icahn could thus have an economic interest to oppose the merger, even if the merger were in the interest of Mylan, as long as the market thought that the merger would be significantly more beneficial to King. In that event, Icahn would gain more from a defeat of the merger through his short position in King than he lost on account of his long position in Mylan. For example, suppose Icahn shorted the King shares at $30 per share, so that the shares would go up to $40 per share if the merger was completed but down to $20 per share if the merger failed. Icahn would then profit from defeating the merger if his profits from shorting were greater than the increase in the value of his Mylan stake from approving the; Vote buying traditionally involves an acquisition of votes without an acquisition of an economic stake. Empty voting typically involves an acquisition of shares, vote plus stake, and a separate transaction to divest the economic stake; Empty voting also results in investors who have an economic interest but no voting rights.

Because securities lending is really a transfer of a security subject to an obligation to retransfer an equivalent security later, the securities loan itself would be recorded on the registry as a transfer with the return similarly recorded, Thus, the system forces an attribution of lent shares to specific accounts, with notice to the account holder, while also ensuring that no more than 100% of the shares appear. Because each securities loan involves an actual recorded transfer of shares on the registry, the cost of securities lending may increase, as intermediaries will not be able to lend securities out of the float, the aggregate of shares which are unlikely to be sold during a given period; U.C.C. art. 8 prefatory note (amended 2003); Delaware, for example, provides: The shares of a corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares.

abstract={Never has voting been more important in corporate law. With greater activism among shareholders and the shift from plurality to majority voting for directors, the number of close votes is rising. But is the basic technology of corporate voting adequate to the task? In this Article, we first examine the incredibly complicated system of U.S. corporate voting, a complexity that is driven by the underlying custodial-ownership structure, by dispersed ownership and large trading volumes, and by the rise in short-selling and derivatives. We identify three ways in which things predictably go wrong: pathologies of complexity; pathologies of ownership; and pathologies of misalignment of interests. We then discuss the current legal treatment of these pathologies and consider a variety of directions for reform, ranging from incremental modifications to fundamental redesign. We show that, absent a fundamental reconstruction of the ownership structure, the existing system will continue to be noisy, imprecise, and disturbingly opaque. The problems with the existing system pose fundamental challenges for both proponents of direct shareholder democracy, who advocate more-extensive voting rights for shareholders, and for proponents of indirect shareholder democracy, who advocate deference to a board of directors, the legitimacy of which ultimately rests on shareholder elections.},

abstract={This paper examines the relationship between firm complexity and board of director composition. Utilising the board typology of Baysinger and Zardkoohi (1986), we classify board members either as insiders, business experts, support specialists, or community influentials, and examine board composition in relation to firm internal and external complexity. Internal complexity refers to the sophistication of internal work processes (proxied by firm R&D expenditures, and the amount of invested capital), while external complexity relates to the external competitive structure (proxied by the number of business and geographic segments, and industrial leadership). Utilising a random sample of 150 firms drawn from six industries over the 2003-2005 time period, and after classifying 4,408 directors to one of our board categories, multivariate results confirm conjectures that complexity is related to the specific capabilities that each board member brings to the firm. We find that externally complex firms substitute community influentials for insiders. Additionally, internally complex firms have lower levels of community influentials, which are substituted by insiders and support specialists. This study adds to a small but growing literature that examines the economic determinants of board structure (Boone et al., 2007; Coles et al., 2005; Gillan et al., 2003; Linck et al., 2005), by providing a unique lens in examining board characteristics that goes beyond the traditional insider/independent classification. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The purpose of this study is to examine the association between the establishment of a risk management committee and board structures of Malaysian listed firms. The study predicts that more independent, expert, and diligent boards are likely to establish a stand-alone risk management committee. It employs a cross-sectional analysis of 690 firms listed on the Bursa Malaysia for the financial year ending in 2003. Multiple regression analysis is used to estimate the relationships proposed in the hypotheses. The study finds a strong support for an association between the establishment of a risk management committee and strong board structures. Specifically, the result shows that firms with higher proportions of non-executive directors on boards and firms that separate the positions of chief executive officers and board chairs are likely to set up a stand-alone risk management committee. Firms with greater board expertise and board diligence are also likely to establish a risk management committee. These findings suggest that stronger boards demonstrate their commitment to and awareness of improved internal control environment. Finally, the study also documents a positive and significant association between firm size, complexity of a firm's operations, and the use of Big Four audit firms with the establishment of a risk management committee. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.},

abstract={This study adds clarity to inconclusive results in previous literature about the link between board characteristics and the level of social responsibility performance by using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. Specifically, we propose a new holistic framework based on the complexity theory. From a sample of 471 non-financial companies from the USA for the period 2008–2010, our findings support the four tenets of complexity theory: equifinality, complexity, asymmetry, and causal asymmetry. More concretely, they suggest that CSR performance depends on a complex configuration of some board characteristics, such as size, independency, diversity and activity, and other corporate attributes (i.e., company size, leverage, and growth opportunities). These factors play a key role as the ingredients of the recipe and, in a proper combination, contribute to obtaining high levels of social responsibility performance.

abstract={Opportunities for financial reporting fraud arise because of information asymmetries—often labeled “lack of transparency”—between top managers and their diverse shareholders. We evaluate the relative contributions of information asymmetries arising from industry-level and firm-level complexities to the likelihood of top managers committing financial reporting fraud. Using a sample of 453 matched pairs of firms that have and have not been identified as having committed financial reporting fraud, we found that information asymmetries arising from industry- and firm-level complexities increase the likelihood of financial fraud. Moreover, more CEO stock options increase the likelihood of fraud when industry complexity is high, while aggressive monitoring by the audit committee reduces the likelihood of reporting fraud when firm-level complexity is high. © 2013, © The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract={Collectively, current resource-development literature has given little attention to organizational features of ownership as important variables in community resilience. By drawing from six local buyout cases in Canada's forest sector, we reveal the complexity and numerous constraints on local ownership and expose a more nuanced context than most sociologists tend to consider. Our findings suggest that the meaning of local ownership and community resilience varies depending upon the composition (e.g., private vs. public; mill vs. forest license vs. coupled mill & forest license), type (social, cooperative, trust and/or direct-share ownership), extent of ownership (percentage of local versus extra-local shares), and the level of control (e.g., proportion of locally held seats on the Board of Directors) associated with ownership. Future research on local ownership should more carefully differentiate between the nature of local ownership and its associated outcomes. Copyright © 2006 by the Rural Sociological Society.},

abstract={Recently, many empirical studies have examined the determinants of corporate boards of directors. Using an agency theory framework, the authors explain how nonprofit boards are structured. Although nonprofits cannot disburse profits to their contributors, the role played by their boards of trustees in monitoring and advising managers is analogous to that of corporate boards of directors. Using a sample of Spanish foundations, the authors show that nonprofit board determinants, such as organizational complexity and financing structure, are similar in many ways to those of corporate boards. However, nonprofit age illustrates the different natures of these organizations and their voluntary boards. © 2009 SAGE Publications.},

abstract={Prior research shows that firms benefit from the social capital of their boards of directors but has not explored the antecedents of new director social capital. We argue that firms can attract directors with social capital by offering more compensation. We also argue that more complex firms (firms with a greater scale and scope of operations) are more attractive to such directors because of the greater experience and exposure that such directorships provide. Similarly, we argue that firms with high-status directors on their current boards will be more attractive to directors with social capital. We analyse the social capital of new outside directors added to boards of semiconductor firms between 1993 and 2007. Surprisingly, we find no support for the hypothesis that higher compensation is associated with adding directors with high status or board ties. However, firm complexity is associated with the ability to add new directors who have social capital, and the status of current board members is associated with the ability to add new directors who also have high status. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={The board of directors is a flat governance structure where each director has an equal vote in determining the collective actions taken by the group. Yet, some boards choose to delegate authority for specific tasks to numerous committees, while others choose to create relatively few subcommittees of the board. We investigate the determinants of subordinate board structures, exploring both their benefits and costs. Using a sample of the S&P 1500 we find that subordinate board structures are positively related to board size and the proportion of outside directors, even after controlling firm characteristics such as complexity and ownership structure. Further tests indicate that these board structures can offset the negative associations that board size and the proportion of outsiders can have with firm performance. Yet, in firms with relatively small or insider oriented boards, where co-ordination problems among directors or social loafing may be less pronounced, we find that subordinate board structures are negatively related to firm performance. Categorizing committees as either monitoring or advisory, we find that both types of committees appear related to firm performance. Taken as whole, these results are consistent with the idea that subordinate board structures can be a costly remedy to alleviate problems that arise with larger, more outsider dominated boards. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Drawing on the complexity theory and responding to the recent calls to use such creative methods that mix between a quantitative and qualitative approach. Therefore, this study fills the literature gap, adding novelties, showing evidence from the unexplored (or underexplored) European context and, consequently, shedding light to inconclusive results in previous research concerning the effect of audit committee (AC) and board characteristics on corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure by applying a novel research methodology: the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. The data were collected from Eikon database for a sample of the top 69 non-financial European companies (based on market capitalisation) for the period 2016–2018. The study results support the equifinality and complexity tenets of complexity theory. It also suggests that CSR disclosure relies on a complex configuration of some AC attributes, for example, independence, financial expert member, chair independence, size and activity, and other board characteristics (independence, gender, size, activity, and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) duality). These characteristics play a leading part as a recipe ingredient and, in an appropriate combination, promote achieving high CSR disclosure levels. Our empirical results offer multidimensional and valuable insights for professionals, regulators, and policymakers in establishing and revising the guidelines regarding the AC and board of directors' composition. © 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Top management teams (TMTs) and boards of directors (boards) face increasingly turbulent environments as they strategically lead firms toward superior firm performance. The dominant theoretical lens about these two groups is agency theory, which focuses on the need for independence. We suggest that the environment in which the TMT and board govern is broader than conceptualized by agency theory, and thus theories regarding strategic leadership also require expansion. Drawing from the multiteam systems literature and broader systems theory, we offer a new consideration of the TMT and board as part of a strategic-oriented multiteam system, which we refer to as a strategic leadership system. The core premise of our theorizing is that TMTs and boards that strongly emphasize attention to both working independently and interdependently enhance their group and shared task performance, and in turn, firm performance. We further nuance this theorizing by describing how external environmental characteristics (i.e., munificence, complexity, dynamism) strengthen or weaken the influence of attention to working independently or interdependently, thereby shifting the zones of system effectiveness. Based on this theorizing, we offer a 2 3 2 framework combined with practical recommendations for strategic leaders. Additional implications, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed. © 2020 Academy of Management Review.},

abstract={Background: Despite pressures to change the role of hospital boards, hospitals have made few changes in board composition or director selection criteria. Hospital boards have often continued to operate in their traditional roles as either "monitors" or "advisors." More attention to the direct involvement of hospital boards in the strategic decision-making process of the organizations they serve, the timing and circumstances under which board involvement occurs, and the board composition that enhances their abilities to participate fully is needed. Purposes: We investigated the relationship between broader expertise among hospital board members, board involvement in the stages of strategic decision making, and the hospital's strategic focus. Methodology/Approach: We surveyed top management team members of 72 nonacademic hospitals to explore the participation of critical stakeholder groups such as the board of directors in the strategic decision-making process. We used hierarchical regression analysis to explore our hypotheses that there is a relationship between both the nature and involvement of the board and the hospital's strategic orientation. Findings: Hospitals with broader expertise on their boards reported an external focus. For some of their externally-oriented goals, hospitals also reported that their boards were involved earlier in the stages of decision making. Practice Implications: In light of the complex and dynamic environment of hospitals today, those charged with developing hospital boards should match the variety in the external issues that the hospital faces with more variety in board makeup. By developing a board with greater breadth of expertise, the hospital responds to its complex environment by absorbing that complexity, enabling a greater potential for sensemaking and learning. Rather than acting only as monitors and advisors, boards impact their hospitals' strategic focus through their participation in the strategic decision-making process.

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to review and critique prior research on audit committees using a practice-theory lens. Research on audit committees has followed the same trajectory as early research on boards of directors, which has been criticised for its singular theoretical perspectives and methodologies that do not capture the complexity of real-world experiences/behaviours. Design/methodology/approach – The authors devise an analytical framework based on practice theory to conduct the review. The authors examine what audit committees should do (i.e. best practice) vs what audit committees actually do (i.e. actual activities in practice – praxis). Attributes of audit committee members, and the relationship dynamics relevant to their role execution (i.e. practitioners), are considered. Findings – Research on boards has found that over-emphasis on agency theory’s monitoring role negatively impacts boards’ effectiveness. The authors invoke other theories in examining what audit committees do in practice. The authors characterise the role of audit committees as oversight not monitoring. The authors question whether, similar to auditing, audit committees are blamist tools or are genuinely orientated towards supporting improvements in organisational management systems. The authors unpack the ritualistic ceremonial behaviours and symbolic endeavours vs substantive engagement by audit committees. The analytical framework also considers the “guardianship circle” around audit committees in the form of the key practitioners and their relationships: audit committee members, auditors and managers. Originality/value – Drawing on the analytical framework, the authors provide directions for further opportunities for research of audit committees. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate two research questions. Is internal control system (ICS) disclosure, as a monitoring mechanism, associated with the characteristics of the board of directors, particularly the audit committee as the main board committee devoted to the effectiveness of ICS? Does the regulatory environment, particularly the regulation on ICS disclosure as an external governance/monitoring mechanism play a role in shaping the relationship between board monitoring and ICS disclosure and, if so, how? Design/methodology/approach - The authors study the ICS disclosure of 149 companies listed in four European financial markets (London, Paris, Frankfurt and Milan), each with its own regulations about ICS disclosure, during a six-year period (2003-2008). Findings - The findings support an inverse association between the extent of ICS disclosure and the proxies for board monitoring. The authors also find a statistically significant negative relationship between board monitoring and substantial ICS disclosure but no relationship between board monitoring and formal ICS disclosure. The evidence also shows that the regulatory environment moderates the relationship between board monitoring and ICS disclosure by introducing trade-offs among monitoring mechanisms. Research limitations/implications - An important caveat of the research is that it does not explore if and how investors use ICS disclosure to evaluate the firm. Practical implications - The authors propose a framework for the analysis of ICS disclosure that overcomes limitations of previous literature that has neglected the importance of the content beyond the extent of ICS disclosure. Through this framework researchers, practitioners and standard setters are able to separate merely descriptive, formal un-useful disclosure (boilerplate information) on the composing elements of the ICS from substantial disclosure regarding the functioning of the ICS (monitoring function). Originality/value - The authors also provide evidence that the relationship between board monitoring and ICS disclosure varies with the content of the information communicated, thus offering guidance for future research not to focus on measuring the extent or quantity of disclosure but on the variety and complexity of the information communicated. © 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: This study seeks to explore how non-executive directors address governance problems on Dutch two-tier boards. Within this board model, challenges might be particularly difficult to address due to the formal separation of management boards' decision-management from supervisory boards' decision-control roles. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire among non-executive directors provide unique insights into three major challenges in the boardrooms of two-tier boards in The Netherlands. Findings: The study indicates that non-executive directors mainly experience challenges in three areas: the ability to ask management critical questions, information asymmetries between the management and supervisory boards and the management of the relationship between individual executive and non-executive directors. The qualitative in-depth analysis reveals the complexity of the contributing factors to problems in the boardroom and the range of process and social interventions non-executive directors use to address boardroom issues with management and the organization of the board. Practical implications: While policy makers have been largely occupied with the "right" board composition, the results highlight the importance of adequately addressing operational challenges in the boardroom. The results emphasize the importance of a better understanding of board processes and the need of non-executive directors to carefully manage relationships in and around the boardroom. Originality/value: Whereas most studies have focussed on regulatory initiatives to improve the functioning of boards (e.g. the independence of the board), this study explores how non-executive directors attempt to enhance the effectiveness of boards on which they serve. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This study draws from the corporate governance literature to investigate the implications of board involvement for international joint ventures (IJVs). We extend recent corporate governance research on the value of board involvement by investigating unique sources of complexity related to the nature of the IJV. We argue and find that board involvement can enhance the performance of IJVs, particularly for collaborations that are complex in nature due to their broad functional scope as well the level of market overlap between IJV parents. We complement recent research on joint venture control that has focused on the antecedents and types of control, as well as studies on formal (e.g. contractual safeguards and monitoring) and informal governance mechanisms (e.g. trust) by providing empirical evidence that IJV board involvement is valuable when directors undertake their control and coordination responsibilities. We advance corporate governance research by providing evidence that joint ventures possess several unique characteristics that shape the value of board involvement, thereby showing that applications of corporate governance theory to joint ventures are useful, but should be made with care. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies.},

abstract={Purpose: The primary objectives of this paper are to: develop a multi-attribute pattern of the corporate governance model in Thai state-owned enterprises; assess the relative importance of different corporate governance practices; and provide detailed information of each corporate governance practice. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative and quantitative approaches were used. A case study was conducted to gather information on specific corporate governance behaviors in Thai state-owned enterprises. Then a questionnaire was developed and tested in 38 Thai state-owned enterprises. Factor analysis was conducted to examine a common framework of corporate governance practices. Findings: This research demonstrated the multi-attribute nature of the corporate governance model in Thai state-owned enterprises. According to this model, the most important corporate governance practice is strategic human resource management, followed by information technology, board of directors, risk management, internal control, and internal audit sequentially. Additionally, this study brings out insights into corporate governance practices that represent the specific characteristics of Thai state-owned enterprises. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited by the fact that the sample represents only Thai state-owned enterprises. Further studies should be conducted to better understand the complexity of the multi-attribute nature of the corporate governance model in state-owned enterprises in developing countries. Practical implications: Policy makers can utilize the multi-attribute nature of the corporate governance model as a guideline for the further development of corporate governance practices in other state-owned enterprises. Originality/value: This study demonstrated the multi-attribute nature of the corporate governance model in state-owned enterprises in developing countries such as Thailand. This research confirms the broad principles of corporate governance as well as providing detailed information on corporate governance practices from a new perspective. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Previous research about the effects of board structure and process on the firm financial performance is based on conflicting theoretical perspectives, and empirical results, mostly based on regression analysis, are inconclusive. Building from Complexity Theory and configurational analysis, this study offers clarity to inconclusive previous empirical results about the link among several board features and firm financial performance. From a sample of 295 non-financial firms from Southern Europe for the period 2001–2010, and by using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, findings of this study show that firm financial performance depends on a complex configuration of several board features (board size, board independence, leadership structure and board activity) and several corporate characteristics (firm size, firm leverage and firm age). This paper has implications for academics. Despite different theoretical arguments and inconclusive results of the wide empirical literature addressing the effect of board characteristics on the firm performance, building from Complexity Theory this paper adds to our knowledge because it empirically explores under which circumstances different board features should contribute positively or negatively to firm performance. The results of this study have also implications for policy makers and practitioners by providing some useful hints to the controversial relationship between corporate governance and financial performance. In this sense, general corporate governance recommendations must be rethought. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In a cross-country setting, we document that busy boards of directors (i.e., outside directors with multiple directorships) enhance a bank's financing capacity by lowering its cost of debt, which is consistent with the signalling quality hypothesis. Our analysis further reveals that this negative association is more pronounced in conventional banks than their Islamic counterparts. Possibly owning to the distinctive governance structure and the complexity of the Islamic business model, which requires closer monitoring, Muslim debtholders might depreciate a busy board of directors as it is likely to associate with lower scrutinising effectiveness. Our results provide a positive counterpoint to the negative relationship that exists between busy directors and firm performance, and contributes to understanding the indispensable role busy boards play in debt financing. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to unravel the root causes as to why the boardroom independence–corporate performance linkage remains an elusive conundrum in the academic literature, and to propose practical recommendations for future research endeavors. Design/methodology/approach – The probing of the underlying issues is made via an extensive review of the existing literature. A thoughtful analysis is conducted from a multi-disciplinary perspective by soliciting feedback from academics with corporate governance expertise in finance, accounting, economy, strategy, management and organizational behavior. Findings – The lack of consensus on the economic value of an independent boardroom is attributed to three reasons. The first reason is ontological complexities inherent to the very nature of the corporation. The second reason is methodological complexities intrinsic to normative research with large archival data. The third reason is self-serving behavioral motive that cannot be factored in archival data. Research limitations/implications – The infusion of complementary methodologies to the existing empirical dogmatism would provide the framework for a better understanding of corporate governance challenges and opportunities, particularly as it relates to making causal inferences on boardroom independence and corporate performance. Practical implications – New insights on boardroom independence would directly influence corporate practices. Social implications – The determination as to what constitutes optimum boardroom configuration has emerged as an issue of considerable importance to shareholders, policymakers and other stakeholders. Originality/value – Virtually no studies have been conducted in a comprehensive and systematic manner addressing the fundamental question as to why research pertaining to boardroom independence–corporate performance has not yielded unequivocal results in the relevant academic literature, thus the originality and value of this research. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Skilled labour has gained significance as a production factor in the age of information technology, but accounting does not recognize human capital as an asset that contributes to the firm's earning power. This paper suggests a method to develop a latent index to proxy the managerial-skill component of human capital. The proposed index depends on the empirical validity of self-sorting theories for managerial tasks and the choice of the type of at-risk (i.e. outcome-contingent) compensation contract. The empirical analysis uses data on compensation of executive members of the board of directors, their personal attributes (experience, risk aversion and wealth), firm-specific variables (profitability growth rates, organizational complexity and operating risk), and type of industry. The extent to which equity markets value the predicted labour skills shows that investors in the marketplace recognize human capital even though accounting does not. The valuation coefficient on the variable imputed for human capital is significant for all years examined. This study contributes to the literature by showing that relative incentive compensation (incentive pay per dollar of fixed salary) is a viable surrogate for human capital defined as the skills embodied in people. © 2003, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={In 2004, Spain's Banco Santander purchased Britain's Abbey National Bank in a deal valued at fifteen billion dollars--an acquisition that made Santander one of the ten largest financial institutions in the world. Here, Mauro Guillén and Adrian Tschoegl tackle the question of how this once-sleepy, family-run provincial bank in a developing economy transformed itself into a financial-services group with more than sixty-six million customers on three continents.Founded 150 years ago in the Spanish port city of the same name, Santander is the only large bank in the world where three successive generations of one family have led top management and the board of directors. But Santander is fully modern. Drawing on rich data and in-depth interviews with family members and managers, Guillén and Tschoegl reveal how strategic decisions by the family and complex political, social, technological, and economic forces drove Santander's unprecedented rise to global prominence. The authors place the bank in this competitive milieu, comparing it with its rivals in Europe and America, and showing how Santander, faced with growing competition in Spain and Europe, sought growth opportunities in Latin America and elsewhere. They also address the complexities of managerial succession and family leadership, and weigh the implications of Santander's stellar rise for the consolidation of European banking.Building a Global Banktells the fascinating story behind this powerful corporation's remarkable transformation--and of the family behind it. © 2008 by Princeton University Press.

abstract={At the close of the twentieth century, U.S. corporate scholarship was dominated by a principal-agent paradigm that assumed that shareholders were the principals or sole residual claimants in public corporations, and also assumed that corporate directors were the shareholders' agents. This approach led many corporate scholars to assume that the proper purpose of the corporation was to maximize shareholder wealth and that the chief economic problem of interest in corporate law was the "agency cost" problem of getting corporate directors to focus on this goal. There are basic aspects of U.S. corporate law, however, that the principal-agent model cannot explain. These include directors' extensive and sui generis legal powers; the fact that directors control dividends; the device of legal personality; and the open-ended rules of corporate purpose. These corporate law "anomalies" have prompted contemporary economic and legal scholars to begin to move beyond a focus on agency costs and to pay attention to a second economic problem that arises in public corporations: the problem of protecting specific investment. When corporate production requires more than one individual or group to make specific investments, problems of intrafirm opportunism arise if shareholders try to exploit each other's specific investments or try to exploit the specific investments of creditors, employees, customers, and other groups. Board governance, while worsening agency costs, may provide a second-best solution to such intrafirm rent-seeking. This perspective explains many important corporate law "anomalies" that cannot be explained by the principal-agent model. It also suggests a pressing need to revisit conventional notions of corporate purpose. Focusing on the problem of specific investment suggests that the proper purpose of the public corporation is not maximizing shareholder wealth, but promoting long-term, value-creating economic production under conditions of complexity and uncertainty, in a fashion that provides surplus benefits not only to shareholders but to other groups that make specific investments in corporations as well. This corporate objective is difficult to measure, much less maximize. Nevertheless, it may provide a better gauge of good corporate governance than the simplistic rubric of shareholder wealth. © 2006 T.M.C. Asser Press.},

abstract={Research summary: The formation of interorganizational ties is a consequential phenomenon examined in strategic management research. Beckman, Haunschild, and Phillips (2004) is one of the first studies to comprehensively consider interorganizational network change by exploring factors that affect both alliance and board interlock formation. They find that firm-specific uncertainty relates to broadening actions, whereas market-level uncertainty causes firms to reinforce current structures. Our replication considers whether these relationships operate similarly in a differing temporal context. Building from the framework of the original study, we suggest our findings offer intriguing new empirical evidence highlighting the importance of time as a boundary condition in understanding embedded firm actions. Managerial summary: The development of interorganizational relationships, such as alliances and ties between boards of directors, has an important impact on innovation, strategic actions, and firm performance. This study examines whether the dynamics of interorganizational relationship formation remain consistent over time. We replicate earlier work by Beckman and colleagues (2004), but with an expanded data set covering more than 20 years. Over this broader time horizon, we find a shift in behavior, with companies facing firm-specific uncertainty seeking to reinforce their current relationships and companies facing industry-wide uncertainty seeking to diversify their risk by expanding their network. Our results demonstrate the importance of replication studies in research and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complexity surrounding interorganizational relationships.

abstract={In the growing debate about designing new management control systems (MCS) to include stakeholder values, there has been little discussion about information overload. Stakeholder advocates call for including more environmental and related social disclosures but do not consider how information overload might impair the use and interpretation of corporate performance measures. As we know, shareholders and boards of directors are most concerned with market data such as earnings per share, dividend rates, and market value growth. In this chapter, we assert that management control system designers must consider information overload before expanding the MCS to include social and nonfinancial disclosures. The paradox in expanding MCS is that demand for sustainability performance measures will likely result in overload for both information preparers and information users. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and similar sustainability disclosures are likely to overload MCS and overwhelm the readers and users by performance reports that include multiple dimensions. CSR affects the design of companies' annual reports because stakeholders are increasingly concerned with how organizations address their social responsibilities and how they disclose their societal responses. Management accountants are accustomed to providing performance measures within an organization and MCS usually have an internal focus. CFOs are often not accustomed to balancing the needs of stakeholders with those of managers and owners. We suggest that companies and CFOs will face an information overload dilemma in making these determinations, and that users will be overloaded in sifting through the multiple dimensions of information that are increasingly being provided. We suggest that the bias toward financial performance measures will distort both the provision of relevant information and the use of sustainability performance measures. We modified the Epstein and Roy sustainability model (2001) to illustrate some of these potential impacts. We note that the balanced scorecard (BSC) was developed as one such tool to reflect and communicate multiple measures. We summarize a previous study showing how managers ignored multiple performance measures in a performance scorecard study. We then relate our results to some of the information overload literature to support our suggestion that stakeholders will face many of the same information overload issues and constraints when using and processing social disclosures. Our summary of the information overload literature results in a call for more interdisciplinary information overload research involving real-world contexts and tasks. We note that most of the extant information overload literature is restricted to discipline-based silo-oriented studies and to simplistic evaluations, brand identification, or forecasting tasks. Our study went into some depth to describe the business, its strategies and objectives, and a comparison of actual results to specific goals. As management control systems evolve or are designed to report sustainability data, the issues surrounding increasing complexity and information overload will become exponentially problematic. We suggest that future research also include consideration of information overload conditions facing preparers and disclosers of sustainability measures.

abstract={Risk management is an important function to the service business that continues to grow in breadth and complexity. It involves the systematic application of a five-step process which is designed to enable a risk manager to cope with the risks of pure loss exposures. A number of operational and financing techniques can be employed to treat risks of loss once they have been identified. The particular technique(s) chosen by a service firm depends to a significant degree upon the firm’s objectives in relation to each of six performance dimensions. While the concept of risk management follows a patterned thought process and can be readily understood, it is helpful to select risk management techniques on the basis of relatively sophisticated decision theory formulations. Assistance in identifying, analysing, and treating loss exposures may be sought from outside experts. Too often, top management and boards of directors do not realise the value and necessity of an effective risk management programme in minimising the adverse impact of risk on the service firm's resources and earnings. A sound risk management programme enables a service business to minimise expenses, operate more effectively, and achieve some combination of pre-loss and post-loss objectives. Such a programme can make it possible for the service firm to survive an otherwise crippling financial loss and sustain service continuity. Sound risk management also engenders peace of mind and confidence while enabling owners to concentrate more of their attention on speculative risks which they might otherwise seek to avoid. For these reasons, it is increasingly crucial that service firm managers learn to manage pure risks effectively. © 1991, MCB},

abstract={Purpose – To: evaluate Prospect Theory and Cumulative Prospect Theory as functional models of decision making and risk within various contexts; compare and analyze risk models and decision-making models; evaluate models of stock risk developed by Robert Engle and related models; establish whether the models are related and have the same foundations; relate risk, decision making and options theory; and develop the foundations for a new model of decision making and risk named “belief systems”. Design/methodology/approach – Critiques existing academic work in different contexts. Analyzes the shortcomings of various measures of risk, and group decision making, which was not addressed in developing Prospect Theory and Cumulative Prospect Theory. Develops the characteristics of a mew model for decision making and risk named “belief systems”, and then differentiates it from belief networks. Findings – Decision making is a multi-factor, multi-dimensional process that often requires the processing of information, and thus, it is inaccurate to impose rigid models in decision making; the existing metrics for quantifying risk are inadequate; Prospect Theory and Cumulative Prospect Theory were developed using questionable methods and data, and are impractical; the analysis of probabilistic insurance and most of the theories and “effects” developed by Kahneman and Tversky's articles are invalid and impractical; Prospect Theory, Cumulative Prospect Theory, Expected Utility Theory, and market-risk models are conceptually the same and do not account for many facets of risk and decision making; risk and decision making are better quantified and modeled using a mix of situation-specific dynamic, quantitative and qualitative factors; belief systems can better account for the multi-dimensional characteristics of risk and decision making. Research limitations/implications – Areas for further research include: development of dynamic market-risk models that incorporate asset-market psychology, liquidity, market size, frequency of trading, knowledge differences among market participants, and trading rules in each market; and further development of concepts in belief systems. Practical implications – Decision making and risk assessment are multi-criteria processes that typically require some processing of information, and thus cannot be defined accurately by rigid quantitative models; Prospect Theory and Cumulative Prospect Theory are abstract, rigid, and are not practical models for decision making; and existing market-risk models are inaccurate, and thus the international financial system may be compromised. Originality/value – The issues discussed are relevant to government regulators, central banks, judges, risk managers, executives, derivatives regulators, stock exchange regulators, legislators, psychologists, boards of directors, finance professionals, management science/operations research professionals, health-care-informatics professionals, scientists, engineers, and people in any situation that requires decision making and risk assessment. © 2005, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose – To: evaluate Prospect Theory and Cumulative Prospect Theory as functional models of decision making and risk within various contexts; compare and analyze risk models and decision-making models; evaluate models of stock risk developed by Robert Engle and related models; establish whether the models are related and have the same foundations; relate risk, decision making and options theory; and develop the foundations for a new model of decision making and risk named “belief systems”. Design/methodology/approach – Critiques existing academic work in different contexts. Analyzes the shortcomings of various measures of risk, and group decision making, which was not addressed in developing Prospect Theory and Cumulative Prospect Theory. Develops the characteristics of a mew model for decision making and risk named “belief systems”, and then differentiates it from belief networks. Findings – Decision making is a multi-factor, multi-dimensional process that often requires the processing of information, and thus, it is inaccurate to impose rigid models in decision making; the existing metrics for quantifying risk are inadequate; Prospect Theory and Cumulative Prospect Theory were developed using questionable methods and data, and are impractical; the analysis of probabilistic insurance and most of the theories and “effects” developed by Kahneman and Tversky's articles are invalid and impractical; Prospect Theory, Cumulative Prospect Theory, Expected Utility Theory, and market-risk models are conceptually the same and do not account for many facets of risk and decision making; risk and decision making are better quantified and modeled using a mix of situation-specific dynamic, quantitative and qualitative factors; belief systems can better account for the multi-dimensional characteristics of risk and decision making. Research limitations/implications – Areas for further research include: development of dynamic market-risk models that incorporate asset-market psychology, liquidity, market size, frequency of trading, knowledge differences among market participants, and trading rules in each market; and further development of concepts in belief systems. Practical implications – Decision making and risk assessment are multi-criteria processes that typically require some processing of information, and thus cannot be defined accurately by rigid quantitative models; Prospect Theory and Cumulative Prospect Theory are abstract, rigid, and are not practical models for decision making; and existing market-risk models are inaccurate, and thus the international financial system may be compromised. Originality/value – The issues discussed are relevant to government regulators, central banks, judges, risk managers, executives, derivatives regulators, stock exchange regulators, legislators, psychologists, boards of directors, finance professionals, management science/operations research professionals, health-care-informatics professionals, scientists, engineers, and people in any situation that requires decision making and risk assessment. © 2005, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The current U.S. climate of racial and social injustice has prompted a renewed call for diverse and equitable ways to rethink community philanthropy. Community foundations are vehicles for community philanthropy which offer vast benefits for social improvement and community development. The board of directors ensures these organizations fulfill their mission, making decisions on funding priorities and holding the organization functionally and fiscally responsible. Drawing on constructs of diversity and representative bureaucracy and a case study of Florida community foundations, we suggest that diversity is understood in different ways and the presence of diverse board members may be linked to advancing the interests of diverse communities and in achieving outcomes that assist in the needs of certain social groups. Increased understanding of diversity can improve foundation and philanthropic effectiveness and bring broader social change by promoting equity and social justice among community-based philanthropic organizations. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

abstract={Questions on the use of current theories of governance for co-operative businesses are prevalent within the literature. This paper seeks to determine if the theory of cyclical board behavior can provide insight into the evolution of co-operative boards within food co-operatives in Ontario, Canada. To answer these questions managers from food co-operatives participated in a one-hour long, semi-structured interview providing their understanding of the governance within their co-operatives. Managers identified board member engagement, the changing role of the board and succession planning as issues of concern. Engagement level of board members varied from a lack of participation to overbearing participation, which caused tensions within the co-operative. Current governance theories do not appear to adequately explain governance within a co-operative structure. A single, universal governance framework does not address the complexities of a member owned firm. The cyclical board behavior, however, does provide insight into co-operative board evolution. © 2016 The AuthorsAnnals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2016 CIRIEC},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss the outlook for risk management and enterprise risk management (ERM) within the hospitality sector including how ERM is being balanced with the need to innovate, and what boards of directors are doing to become more engaged in risk oversight. The implementation of ERM is about taking a strategic view of risk and linking it to business goals and value creation. Design/methodology/approach: An interviewer-administered survey was used to collect data from 33 senior risk professionals and other industry experts who had a clear understanding of both risk management and ERM. A structured and semi-structured questionnaire consisting of three sections was personally administered to 33 respondents in 2018 to collect information from risk professionals and other industry experts. Findings: It is important to create a culture of risk awareness and to incorporate risk planning into business decisions. The complexity of modern business necessitates that managers in the hospitality sector have greater skill levels than ever before. This research should help hospitality managers to better understand the core risks and link them to strategy. ERM creates an environment where the organization as a whole can support the value creation process with a sharper focus on risk management. Practical implications: The growing role of technology along with human connections is shaping the hospitality sector and redefining the travel ecosystem. Future travel experiences are likely to be influenced by a blend of technology and human experiences. Many Indian companies are applying the traditional risk management model in their businesses, while ERM is their future goal. The evolution from a traditional risk management model to ERM is challenging, and so it is important to have an appropriate framework in place for its implementation. Originality/value: Hospitality managers need to know how to proactively manage risk management and ERM as the sector is increasingly vulnerable to internal risks. ERM creates a direct linkage between risks and opportunities required for decision-making in a dynamic environment. With growing competition on a global level, the hospitality industry should aim to manage risks strategically to increase the likelihood that organizational objectives can be achieved. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This study supports tournament theory in relation to high levels of organizational hierarchies, indicating that the job complexity facing the top management team supposes that pay dispersion positively influences firm performance. Examining a sample of 709 firm-year observations of Spanish listed companies spanning the period 2004-2012, our results indicate that the association between firm performance and top management team pay dispersion is conditional on the effectiveness of corporate governance. High top management team pay dispersion is associated with better performance in owner-controlled firms, where more effective monitoring is exerted by the board of directors.

abstract={Concern for board of directors considerably increased with the recent developments in the corporate governance field. Despite that extensive research was conducted, the understanding of the board and its effects is still limited. This is mainly because that the majority of the corporate governance research focused mostly on the direct relation of board characteristics with organizational outcomes, and neglected the effect of intervening variables, leading to inconclusive research findings. Deriving on this limitation, in this study, the effect of board composition on organizational performance was investigated for different environmental conditions, which are measured in terms of munificence and dynamism of the industry in which the organizations operate and product complexity of the organizations. In addition, the moderating effects of these dimensions of organizational task environments on the relationship between board composition and organizational performance were also addressed. Building on resource dependence theory, it is suggested that under different environmental conditions, different compositions of boards will positively influence organizational performance. Based on the data from 80 companies which shares are publicly traded in Istanbul Stock Exchange, the findings indicate that the effect of board composition on organizational performance vary among different environmental conditions. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Despite attempts by the state legislature to fashion the charter of the Pennsylvania Railroad in such a way as to insure a high degree of managerial accountability to the board of directors and to make the corporation broadly accountable to the public, things turned out very differently. The volume and complexity of managerial decisions quickly brought a centralization of power in the hands of the road's professional managers as the board atrophied, and the economic and political power of the road and its dominant figures (J. Edgar Thomson and Thomas A. Scott) negated much of the principle of public accountability. © 1975, The President and Fellows of Harvard College. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This study aims to examine (1) the association between the chief executive officer tenure and audit quality, (2) the relationship between chief executive officer duality and audit quality, (3) the association between board independence and audit quality, (4) the relationship between board size and audit quality, and (5) the role of controlling variables (client size, leverage debt, and business complexity) in controlling these relationships. The research sample includes 325 financial reports from manufacturing firms listed in Amman Stock exchange over the 2014-2018 period. The study relationships are tested by using logistic regression. The results revealed a negative relationship, but not significant between CEO tenure and independent directors with audit quality. In addition, the results showed there is a negative effect of CEO duality on audit quality; also the results revealed that there is a statistically significant effect on the board of directors (board size) on the AQ. In general, the coefficient estimates of controlling variables show that client size and leverage debt positively affect audit quality, and on the contrary, business complexity has an insignificant positive relationship with audit quality. The summary of the study findings play an active role to external auditor opinion on business practice in towered the corporate governance system. © Copyright: The Author(s)},

abstract={Purpose: The emergence of Governance practices in the non-governmental organisation (NGO) sector has become associated with increasingly high levels of organisational complexity. In the light of an expanding civil society sector in Chile and the emergence of formalised governance practices, this paper explores the construction of the Executive Director role in Chilean NGOs with reference to organisational functions, organisational dynamics, and external influences. Design/methodology/approach: Grounded theory is used to explore qualitative data derived from a set of N = 39 interviews conducted in Chile These interviews involve NGO founders, funders, Executive Directors, scholars, consultants, and team members. Findings: The findings reveal the pivotal role played by Executive Directors in conducting organisational activities which, in other types of organisations, are often distributed across various organisational functions. The data also highlight complex dynamics involving overt compliance with external regulatory requirements, uncertainties about financial sustainability, the recruitment of Executive Board members, the exercise of power by Executive Directors, and the influence of founders in leadership configurations. Research limitations/implications: The implications of the study are discussed in relation to the governance and accountability of NGOs, the nature of the Executive Director role, the purpose of Executive Boards in the NGO sector, and the recruitment and training of Board members. It is noted that the study was conducted in the NGO sector in Chile; further research is necessary to establish the generalisability of the findings to other contexts. Originality/value: This paper addresses the shortage of organisational research on NGOs. It contributes by offering analytical perspectives on organisational processes of Leadership and Governance. This paper highlights the relationship between, and interdependency of, those processes. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This study examines the causal complexity of how the effectiveness of board monitoring influences CEO compensation around the world. Previous research drawing from the managerial power theory and ‘increased career risks’ perspective offer alternative arguments for how low and high levels of effective monitoring by boards of directors influence CEO compensation. Adopting a configurational approach using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, we explore the idea that there are multiple causal paths leading to high levels of CEO compensation, such that theoretical logic from both theories may be relevant contingent upon the institutional environment in which the relationship is embedded. Our findings in a sample of 38 countries suggest that high CEO compensation is an outcome of both the presence and absence of effective board monitoring depending upon how it combines with minority investor protections and the cultural dimensions of power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and individualism, as well as the overall stock market value. Specifically, in countries with high levels of effective board monitoring, high CEO compensation will be more likely when the country’s culture is high in uncertainty avoidance, low in power distance and when there are strong protections for minority investors. Whereas in countries with low levels of effective board monitoring, high CEO compensation will be more likely when power distance is high and uncertainty avoidance is low and when there are weak protections for minority investors. Our country-level study highlights the theoretical strengths of employing a configurational approach to explore the complex interrelationships of governance mechanisms and the contexts in which they manifest. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

A relational model of three important themes - compliance (regulatory and legal governance), contacts (networks of suppliers, customers, investors), and content (strategic insights) - emerged as critical to any sustainable high-growth effort. Our findings suggest that advisory boards and boards of directors have a significant role in managing and creating value for emerging high-growth firms due to inherently high failure rates, technological complexity, and market risk - all of which requires access to external resources. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={The historical evolution of corporate governance is considered, highlighting the different eras of governance, the dominant theoretical and practical paradigms, the reformulation of paradigms and counter paradigms. Two alternative and sharply contrasting theorizations, one collective and collaborative (the work of Berle and Means), the other individualistic and contractual (agency theory and shareholder value) are focused upon. The explanatory potential of Blair and Stout's team production theory is elaborated, and its conception of the complexity of business enterprise, with a mediating hierarch (the board of directors) securing a balance between the interests of different stakeholders. The potential for reform of corporate purpose, corporate governance and directors' duties is examined with reference to the UK Modern Company Law Review. The impact of the intensification of the financialization of corporations is analysed, with the increased emphasis upon short-termism. The origins of the global financial crisis in shareholder value orientations and the continuing reverberations of the crisis are explored. Finally, the imperative of the advance of sustainable enterprise is argued, and the critical changes necessitated in corporate purpose and directors' duties.

abstract={Economic theory that suggests underperforming boards of directors should be fearful of an ouster vote by shareholders underappreciates the complexity of shareholder voting decisions. Skill at enhancing firm value has less to do with whether directors win votes and stay at the helm of public companies than previous commentators have presumed. Instead, like incumbent politicians, managers of some of the largest U.S. firms tend to stay in charge of firms because they understand-and take advantage of-the political dynamics of corporate voting. This Article presents a competing theory of shareholder voting decisions, one that suggests that shareholder voting in corporate elections is not dissimilar from citizen voting in political elections. Next, the Article presents the evidence. Using a hand-collected dataset from recent board elections, the Article compares the explanatory power of a standard economic variable (long-term stock price returns) and a political variable (money budgeted for campaigning) on election outcomes. Based on the data, directors' ability to enhance firm value (as measured by stock price returns) is not significantly related to whether they win reelection. Rather, the likelihood of being returned to office appears to be a function of typical election politics-how much was spent by challengers to persuade shareholder voters. These findings have at least two implications. First, the theory that shareholder voting may be politicized helps point the way to how the SEC ought to craft reforms-and, just as important, how not to craft them. Recent SEC reform efforts have the laudable goals of creating new conduits for shareholders to participate in firm affairs, increasing shareholder-nominated candidate success, and disciplining incumbent managers. The results of this study suggest that these reforms will not achieve the stated goals. Even with these reforms, the board continues to have an important political advantage, which likely translates into real votes. As the research here shows, the outcome of elections depends on persuasion and, not simply, as the SEC contends, on shareholders' director nominees being presented alongside those of management. Second, the evidence and theory about shareholder voting presented here has significant implications for understanding mergers and acquisitions, particularly hostile acquisitions. The theory is that acquirers have steep incentives to target firms with poor performance. In most cases, however, such acquisitions depend on winning a vote from shareholders. Thus, if there is any disciplinary effect created by the prospect of takeovers, it depends crucially on understanding what motivates shareholder voting behavior. If voting shareholders respond to political motivations, not economic ones, then the performance of target board members might not be as relevant as takeover theorists had previously surmised. © 2011 by Lee Harris.},

abstract={The theoretical framework for a comprehensive trust model is presented using McAllister's affect- and cognitive-based trust model and Siegrist, Earle, and Gutscher's trust-confidence-cooperation model as the foundation. The enhanced model includes cognitive and affective domains of personality, culture, motivation, reliability, competence, and intuition (as a latent variable) to measure perception of trust between two individuals. The model applies the intercognition of self-leadership for improving trust and building effective relationships within boards of directors. Furthermore, the authors consider the multiplicity of board of director roles and how such complexity affects formation and maintenance of optimal trust. © Baker College 2011.},

abstract={Purpose: Real-options have moved from being an academic theory to a decision-making tool that is being used by managers. The thinking underpinning real options has remained true to its financial options-pricing heritage, which means that it is based on an assumption of managerial risk-neutrality. Managers can be risk-seeking or risk-averse, depending on whether or not they are meeting performance targets. This paper aims to explore the questions of what happens when the assumption of risk neutrality is relaxed and how the outcomes of managerial decisions on investments affect the firm's stockholders and bondholders. Design/methodology/approach: The work is conceptual in its approach. Findings: Managers, stockholders, or bondholders do not lose when managers are performing above target and when environmental uncertainty is high, or below target when environmental uncertainty is low, but managers win at the expense of stockholders when they are meeting performance targets and uncertainty is low, and managers win at the expense of bondholders when they are performing below target and uncertainty is high. Research limitations/implications: Propositions are provided for subsequent empirical testing. The paper holds environmental complexity and munificence constant, but discusses the implication of that in the conclusions. Practical implications: The research has implications for shareholders and bondholders. It also has implications for Boards of Directors and the actions they take within their monitoring and control duties. Originality/value: Because the paper is able to separate the constructs of uncertainty and risk, this is the first work that has been able to fully relax the assumption of risk neutrality that underpins real-options theory. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Drawing on the notion of “faultlines” and the upper echelons perspective, we argue that the gender faultline strength of a board of directors is negatively related to strategic change. More interestingly, while gender faultline strength negatively relates to strategic change under low levels of environmental complexity, environmental dynamism, and environmental munificence, it is positively related to strategic change when environmental complexity, environmental dynamism, and environmental munificence are at high levels. The analyses of panel data of 5781 firm-year observations of 1171 Chinese firms provide support for the hypotheses. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={This study contributes simultaneously to research on women board members and competitive dynamics by investigating two unresolved research questions: What is the effect of female directors on the firm’s competitive repertoire? Under what conditions is this effect more pronounced? Leveraging the “Awareness-Motivation-Capability” (AMC) framework, we predict that having women on the board of directors should impact the complexity, heterogeneity, and volume of the firm’s competitive moves. Relying upon a sample of U.S. pharmaceutical firms for the years 2000 to 2017, we find that adding female directors on the board positively affects the complexity and volume of a firm’s competitive moves, but negatively impacts the heterogeneity of competitive actions. In addition, the presence of a female CEO moderates these effects, leading to more complex competitive actions and increased volume. Thus, our study lends a greater understanding of how female board members influence competitive dynamics and shape the strategic direction of the firm. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={BHP plans to enter the bulk fertilizer market by developing its first potash operation, the Jansen Potash Mine, in Saskatchewan, Canada. In conjunction with Amec Foster Wheeler, the Jansen project team developed a model of the Jansen production and logistics chain to understand the drivers of production capacity. The Detailed Integrated Capacity Estimate model (DICE) is a comprehensive discrete-event simulation model of Jansen's upstream production (mining, hoisting, and ore processing) and downstream logistics (rail, port, and marketing). DICE provides an unprecedented combination of complexity, granularity, and scalability, which informs ore storage capacities, product sizing infrastructure, critical-equipment redundancies, bypasses, and operational practices. The team used DICE during the prefeasibility study of the Jansen project. The model provided the justification for the removal of about $300 million in capital expenses to equip the second of two hoisting shafts, the reduction of planned maintenance, and the increase of the degree of mining automation. Throughout the prefeasibility study, Jansen's annual production in stage 1 of operations was estimated to increase by 15-20 percent, with two-thirds of this gain credited to DICE. This potential additional production added $500 million to the net present value of Jansen stage 1. In consideration of this, among other factors, the BHP board of directors approved the transition of the Jansen project from a prefeasibility to a feasibility study. © 2018 INFORMS.},

abstract={Despite boards of directors’ prominent involvement in strategic alliance (SA) decisions in practice and reports from news media, there is relatively little academic research exploring the board's value for a firm's technical SA investments involving a technical transfer or R&D, which are characterized by a high level of uncertainty, information asymmetry, and extreme complexity. Anchored in the resource dependence theory, this study aims to address this important issue by examining how board of directors contribute their human capital, in the form of relevant strategic experience, may mitigate the core challenges managers face when pursuing technical SAs and thereby influencing their outcomes. Our empirical results show that when outside directors hold more extensive alliance experience, they can better execute their consulting function and improve the firm's technical alliance performance. In addition, directors with experience specifically related to technical alliances also have a positive effect on performance. Last, we find that the impact of alliance experience on technical alliance performance is positively moderated by the size of directors’ prior affiliated companies and their share ownership in the focal firm. © 2016 RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Considerable advances have been made in corporate governance research in recent years and opportunities exist to consider these developments within alliances. We extend the “scope of operations” hypothesis to the domain of joint ventures. This proposition suggests that the monitoring carried out by boards increases when organizations become more complex. The inherent characteristics of JVs generate unique sources of complexity that are currently unexplored in the corporate governance literature. First, we seek to determine their influence on monitoring by using primary data on JV board monitoring. Second, we adopt the size of JV boards as a proxy for monitoring in order to examine whether the determinants of board size and monitoring in fact coincide and to reveal if certain effects are masked by using board size as a simple proxy for monitoring. Doing so enables us to investigate the black-box of what boards actually do as well as extend governance research to other organizational forms. Our findings confirm that the unique characteristics of JVs influence the information needs by the boards resulting in more monitoring by JV directors. Our findings show there is value in bridging alliance theory and the literature on corporate governance research. We also advance practitioner's understanding by providing suggestions on how to structure JV boards in relation to their complexity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The perceived economic value of an independent boardroom configuration has progressively emerged as a matter of considerable importance in the academic and popular literature. The normative research paradigm has fundamentally been dominated by positivists who formulate inferential models populated by large sets of archival data. Regrettably, however, several decades of intense inquiries and passionate debates have invariably failed to ascertain (or dispel) the economic value of an independent boardroom configuration. The lingering boardroom independence–corporate performance saga has reached an impasse with no clear resolution in the foreseeable future. In this study, I provide a diagnosis (through the thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews) of why the economic viability of an independent boardroom remains an elusive phenomenon for positivist researchers. A central reason for the research impasse is attributed to ontological complexities intrinsic to the very nature of the corporation, compounded by multiple layers of methodological complexities. Ultimately, the disentanglement of this enigma would require a pivotal reconceptualization of the corporate governance research agenda. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this study, we investigated the possible moderating effects of environmental dynamism, environmental complexity, and environmental munificence on the relationships between changes in top management teams and board of directors and firm performance in the case of young entrepreneurial firms. The results showed that the three dimensions of environment do not moderate the relationship between the rate of change in top management teams and firm performance. On the other hand, the negative relationship between the rate of change in board of directors and firm performance is exacerbated by environmental complexity and munificence. The implications of these findings are discussed in the article. © The Authors 2014.},

abstract={Purpose - The author's original approach helps to understand the executives and their decision-making process. Design/methodology/approach - The complexity of today's business requires the board of directors (BoD) to go beyond its traditional role of referee, and to become involved as appropriate with the business and with its top managers. The BoD should apply the 3<P>of governance: namely the official policies that tell it what to do and what not to do; a comprehensive process of governance that ensures the effectiveness of its activities; and, last but not least, basic psychology to understand the possible quirks of the top managers. This article complements the author's earlier contribution on the process of governance, and focuses on how the directors can monitor the behavioral patterns of the top managers and assess the impact on their decision making. Findings - The author recommends that the BoD uses the methodology of "Creating Business Value" described in this article. By providing transparency over the whole business system, it brings out the proficiency of the top management, and reveals dysfunctional attitudes. Practical implications - The advocated approach contributes to the effectiveness of the directors as they interact with the executive on critical issues. Originality/value - The author presents an application of "creating business value", an original and holistic methodology that enables all concerned to see where, why, how, and how much business value has been, or will likely be, added or destroyed throughout the enterprise. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This main objective of this study is to examine the impact of a number of variables on the extent of corporate governance disclosure in a firm's annual report. The study analyzes the impact of different variables, including Size of audited company, the existence of audit committee, size of board of directors, number of non-executive members in the board of directors, separated between chairman of board of director and CEO, complexity of firm's operations, size of company, debt ratio, profitability, ownership concentration and the institutional shareholders) on this level of Disclosure of corporate governance. A disclosure index consisting of thirty-seven items of information covering corporate governance was applied to the annual reports of a sample of 64 companies listed on the Amman Stock Exchange for the year 2010. The index is divided into two types of information: compulsory and voluntary. Regression analysis is used to examine the relationship between the extent of disclosure and the explanatory variables. The results of the study revealed that the disclosure level of compulsory items was high and there was no significant variations in the disclosure level between companies. On the other hand, the results indicated that the disclosure level of voluntary items was low and there was a significant variation between companies. The results of multiple regression analysis revealed that there is a positive and significant relationship between the level of corporate governance disclosure and the existence of audit committee, and the separated between the positions of chairman of board of director and CEO. Also, the study found a negative and significant relationship between the level of corporate governance disclosure and the number of non-executive directors in the board of directors. Finally, the study recommended the conduct of future research that may cover other aspects of the topic and incorporate new variables not covered by the current study. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) have transformed businesses, enabling agile and cost-effective IT infrastructure. Both create new opportunities for entrepreneurial businesses and disruptive business models enabling growth. The challenge is that these new opportunities create a co-mingled architecture which is difficult to secure. The complexity of this architecture is magnified with the IoT. Based on interviews with executive leadership teams and boards of directors facing these new environments, we developed the over-arching research question: How do we secure increasingly dynamic architecture in an environment while supporting and creating agile business growth? We then narrowed this down to more specific questions dealt with in this study. The research involved an in-depth exploration of this problem using a survey instrument and multiple qualitative methods involving business leaders from 59 companies between 2017-2018. Based on this analysis, we developed an information security framework for executives in this new environment that builds on previous work. This framework is called the Extended Risk-Based Approach and provides businesses with an approach for securing an enterprise amidst the IoT and agile architecture. Importantly, the data analyzed suggests that this approach is critically needed to address the rapidly growing complexity of enterprise architecture and the digital world we live and work. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={PurposeFrom the resource-based view (RBV), the purpose of this paper is to argue that the board has the capability to participate in international strategic decisions and deal with the environmental complexities that internationalisation brings; and moreover, to achieve better performance than its competitors. Design/methodology/approachThis paper highlights the active participation of the board in firm internationalisation using a sample of 78 Spanish firms quoted on Madrid Stock Exchange. The authors used a longitudinal analysis from 2005 through 2010. FindingsThe results show that while the resources provided by the directors through their level of education and international experience, help them learn and process information, and they are a source of expertise representing “board potential”;. A board that functions well through the directors’ relationships allow the proper integration and use of these resources, and helps create sustainable competitive advantages in an international context. Originality/valueFrom a RBV, this paper refines and extends the concept of “board capability”; as the combination of potential and internal relations that allow boards to undertake their roles competently over time. Additionally, the paper empirically examines the effect of board capability on firm internationalisation. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Solvency II leads to a new system of solvency requirements for insurance undertakings based on a risk-oriented approach. Risks have to be covered by own funds of the insurance undertakings. This academic legal paper analyzes and systemizes the new insurance related solvency system according to the Solvency II-directive, the proposed Level 2-Regulation and the proposed new German Insurance Supervision Act (VAG). It focuses then on the three problematic areas under the new solvency regime, i.e. complexity, volatility and procyclical effects. Finally it turns to the new roles, which the boards of directors and supervisory boards of insurance undertakings, the supervisory authorities, the courts and the academics will play in the Solvency II-process. © Springer-Verlag 2012.},

abstract={Scholarly investigations on the board of directors, although intense from the mid-1990s onward, did not lead to entirely convincing results. This study proposes discussion on building a multidisciplinary and integrated theoretical framework able to capture the complexity and distinctive dimensions of the board as a group decision-making process. This is achieved through an essay developed from analytical and descriptive review of the literature. A synthesis on board research is presented, aiming to understand theoretical models lenses used to study corporate governance issues. The strengths and weaknesses of these models are pointed out, and their influence on board investigation is observed. This essay concludes by proposing a research agenda that considers the addition of psychological and sociological approaches to economic models of the analysis of group decision-making.},

abstract={The accepted history of managerial internal audit is that its origins are in financial and compliance auditing. Managerial was added after firms started to expand geographically or into other businesses. That expansion increased complexity and created problems for managers which the internal auditor assisted in solving with managerial audits. Contrary to that two stage development, something comparable to managerial internal audit was being practiced by the Hudson’s Bay Company in the form of inspections as early as 1871. Rather than in financial and compliance auditing, these inspections had their geneses in the desire of the senior manager and the committee (board of directors) for additional information on the fur trade and retail operations. This paper will describe the inspection function at the historical Hudson’s Bay Company, the circumstances leading to the development of this function, and how it complemented other controls. © 2001, Academy of Accounting Historians.

abstract={Most prior studies have argued that the relationship between firm complexity and board size is a monotonic one: complex firm tend to have a large board size. Contrary to previous work, it is hypothesized in this study that this relationship is more likely to be moderated by board leadership structure. Using a sample of 92 Egyptian listed firms over the period from 2000 to 2004, we found that firm complexity exerted a positive and significant coefficient on board size when the firm adopts a leadership structure that separates the roles of CEO and chairman. However, the incremental effect of firm complexity on board size was negative and significant for firms that combine the roles of CEO and chairman (i.e., CEO duality). This study provides supportive evidence for the argument that firms are more likely to manipulate their boards' characteristics to attain organizational adaptation at the minimum total cost. Thus, studying of one main characteristic of the board of directors without taking into account the expected effect of other characteristics may lead to inconclusive evidence. This study offers insights to practising managers and policy makers. If practising managers want to maximize the value of their firms, they need to broaden their insight to understand that board characteristics are multidimensional, contingent and dynamic in their nature and differ not only across firms and industry, but also across countries. Moreover, before developing and launching new and additional corporate governance reforms, policy makers need to realize that differences in corporate governance systems cannot be fully explained outside their institutional environments.},

abstract={Using the complementary lenses of upper echelons and firm internationalization theories and combining them with executive compensation theory, this study tests the proposition that the increased complexity resulting from firm internationalization will require an alignment between top management team and board composition and compensation. In particular, we assert that the degree of nationality diversity of the top management team and board exerts potentially differential impact on firm performance depending, in part, on the level of executive compensation. Results from empirical tests on a sample of Swiss publicly listed companies support this assertion, suggesting that firms manage the additional complexity of internationalization by increasing the degree of nationality diversity of top management teams and boards. However, our findings also point to the importance of matching executive composition and compensation as we find growth of internationalization of top management teams and boards to be negatively directly related to performance, whereas higher levels of executive compensation acts as both moderator and mediator, exhibiting positive influence on performance.},

Guidance and recommendations are offered to help firms improve their financial disclosures. Design/methodology/approach: The authors base their analysis on the management and accounting literature on readability. Findings: This paper presents the main causes and consequences of complexity in corporate disclosures and identifies four disclosure writing styles: obfuscation, informativeness, deception and avoidance. This paper suggests that firms concerned about the readability of their communications use a balanced strategy and proposes some practical actions for its implementation. Originality/value: This paper makes several contributions by offering insights into questions that should be raised by top management and the board of directors, including: Why care about readability? What are the causes and consequences of low readability? What strategies can we adopt and how should we implement them? © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The use of political skill to further employees’ self-interests and their ability to cope with ambiguity and employment vulnerability during periods of organizational change is an important yet under researched phenomenon. Taking a middle management perspective, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the experiences of Richard, a newly appointed professional youth football Academy Manager during the process of organizational change. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, formal academy team meetings, co-worker interviews, and informal observations and conversations, which were analyzed through the process of narrative analysis. Findings highlighted the hierarchical sensemaking challenges of vertically ‘managing up’ (e.g. Chairman, Board of Directors, 1st Team Manager) and ‘managing down’ (e.g. academy employees), and horizontally ‘managing across’ (e.g. Head of Coaching) during the process of organizational change. Importantly, managing expectations and influencing significant others, through skilled micro-political activity, was central to successfully negotiating the ambiguity and vulnerabilities of organizational life during change. MAD statement This study is the first to examine the micro-political actions and behaviours of middle managers as both recipients and deliverers of organizational change. The self-interests of middle-managers tend to influence strategic change; however, we do not understand how middle-managers make sense of the micro-political nature of such interests during change. This study highlights the complexity of coping with employment vulnerability when negotiating and influencing the actions of senior management whilst also supporting subordinate staff with resistance and uncertainty during change. Furthermore, the micro-political actions and strategies of a middle-manager to develop ‘trust’ amongst colleagues, both vertically ‘above’ and ‘below’ them, and horizontally ‘across’ from them in the organizational hierarchy, are evidenced. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This paper examines the relation between corporate governance mechanisms and earnings management. Using data collected from New Zealand listed companies for the financial year ending in 2005, the results show that the size of the board of directors is significantly positively associated with earnings management. This suggests that larger boards seem to be ineffective in their oversight duties relative to smaller boards. On the other hand, the independence of the board of directors, the independent role of the board chair and chief executive officer, and the independence of audit committees are not significantly associated with earnings management. Thus, these three corporate governance mechanisms are ineffective at monitoring the discretionary choices of management. The lack of effective corporate governance in New Zealand, particularly with regard to boards of directors, is mainly due to the lack of "experience and skills required to oversee the scale, complexity, and characteristics of finance operations" (Ministry of Economic Development, 2009, p.8).},

abstract={Recent research developments underscore the need for research on the processes that link board demography with firm performance. In this article we develop a model of board processes by integrating the literature on boards of directors with the literature on group dynamics and workgroup effectiveness. The resulting model illuminates the complexity of board dynamics and paves the way for future empirical research that expands and refines our understanding of what makes boards effective.},

abstract={In 2004, Spain's Banco Santander purchased Britain's Abbey National Bank in a deal valued at fifteen billion dollars--an acquisition that made Santander one of the ten largest financial institutions in the world. Here, Mauro Guillén and Adrian Tschoegl tackle the question of how this once-sleepy, family-run provincial bank in a developing economy transformed itself into a financial-services group with more than sixty-six million customers on three continents. Founded 150 years ago in the Spanish port city of the same name, Santander is the only large bank in the world where three successive generations of one family have led top management and the board of directors. But Santander is fully modern. Drawing on rich data and in-depth interviews with family members and managers, Guillén and Tschoegl reveal how strategic decisions by the family and complex political, social, technological, and economic forces drove Santander's unprecedented rise to global prominence. The authors place the bank in this competitive milieu, comparing it with its rivals in Europe and America, and showing how Santander, faced with growing competition in Spain and Europe, sought growth opportunities in Latin America and elsewhere. They also address the complexities of managerial succession and family leadership, and weigh the implications of Santander's stellar rise for the consolidation of European banking. Building a Global Bank tells the fascinating story behind this powerful corporation's remarkable transformation--and of the family behind it. © 2008 by Princeton University Press.

abstract={As the 21st century approaches, there are many pressures prompting changes in corporate board behavior. The author characterizes the current responses as TQM (more of the same, only better) or reengineering (transformation). To respond adequately to the reality and complexities of a global economy, the author argues that approaches to both corporate governance and boards are in need of reengineering. Directions for board transformation are illustrated with a new framework based on the orientation and constitution of boards. Five new board configurations and the path of evolution are presented.},

abstract={We investigate trends and determinants of board gender and age diversities using a sample of 8,590 firms for 20 years. Gender diversity and the average age of boards increased, while age diversity decreased in this period. We find that larger, older firms tend to have more gender diversity but less age diversity. More board independence is related to higher gender diversity, while more firm complexity is associated with less age diversity. For younger (older) boards, more female directors are associated with less (more) age diversity. We also find that female directors in older boards generate value for the firm. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Previous research has often focused on the board of directors as the primary actor in the governance of membership-based organizations (MBOs). This chapter aims at a broader approach to MBOs’ internal democratic governance systems by casting the rank-and-file members as the main actors. Drawing on two models, one dealing with member influence and the other portraying single- and multilevel MBOs, the chapter discusses key elements in these organizations’ governance systems, including statutes, the board of directors, nomination committees, lay auditors, modes of member influence, appointment of elected representatives, annual meetings and general assemblies. The intent of the chapter is to raise awareness regarding the scope and complexity of governance in MBOs and to suggest some directions for future research. © Editors and Contributors Severally 2021.},

abstract={In this chapter, Smith and Cockburn reaffirm their claim in a previous book that today's global business contexts are volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA), and leaders must focus more on complex thinking skills and mindsets than developing behavioral competencies. In so doing, leaders must be familiar with the benefits and drawbacks of emerging digital technologies and use these technologies appropriately. In the previous book, the authors defined flexible and dynamic leadership models that assure success in the above contexts and described learning related processes essential to mastering the ability to adapt at rates consistent with the business complexity leaders now face. In this chapter, they extend their previous research and review newly emergingfactors contributing to global business complexity in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0) and explain how these elements may be applied by leaders, including CEOs and Boards of Directors, to augment the power of their recommended leadership models. © 2021, IGI Global.

abstract={Most prior studies have argued that the relationship between firm complexity and board size is a monotonic one: complex firm tend to have a large board size. Contrary to previous work, it is hypothesized in this study that this relationship is more likely to be moderated by board leadership structure. Using a sample of 92 Egyptian listed firms over the period from 2000 to 2004, we found that firm complexity exerted a positive and significant coefficient on board size when the firm adopts a leadership structure that separates the roles of CEO and chairman. However, the incremental effect of firm complexity on board size was negative and significant for firms that combine the roles of CEO and chairman (i.e., CEO duality). This study provides supportive evidence for the argument that firms are more likely to manipulate their boards' characteristics to attain organizational adaptation at the minimum total cost. Thus, studying of one main characteristic of the board of directors without taking into account the expected effect of other characteristics may lead to inconclusive evidence. This study offers insights to practising managers and policy makers. If practising managers want to maximize the value of their firms, they need to broaden their insight to understand that board characteristics are multidimensional, contingent and dynamic in their nature and differ not only across firms and industry, but also across countries. Moreover, before developing and launching new and additional corporate governance reforms, policy makers need to realize that differences in corporate governance systems cannot be fully explained outside their institutional environments.},

Case overview/synopsis: In October 2017, Pavel Titov, the owner and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Abrau-Durso Group, assigned a large international consulting firm to assist him in the development of a new corporate strategy. It was 11 years since the Titov family had taken over the then-struggling iconic sparkling wine manufacturer. The Titovs invested heavily into the enterprise with the dream of reviving the century-old brand, and turned the company around: in 2017, Abrau-Durso was the No. 1 sparkling wine brand in the Russian market. However, the shareholders wanted the company to grow further and believed that it was possible to generate more value. How could the company continue growing and increase its value at a time when the wine market was stagnating and the Russian economy was going through a rough period?

abstract={Learning outcomes: This case study aims to expect the following learning outcomes. A better understanding of the nature of a psychological contract being developed by employees in non-profit organizations, especially working in the areas of social development and the impact of this contract on employee commitment. Enhanced understanding of conflict of interest (personal versus public) in social development organizations and its implications. Identification of issues of task conflict versus interpersonal conflict and its impact on organizational functions. Identification of dynamics of exclusion of internal stakeholders from organizational strategic decision-making process along with its impact on organizational performance and sustainability. Devising a mechanism to avoid such conflicts in social development organizations, in particular, and organizations in general. Case overview/synopsis: This case highlights five issues as follows: it identifies and discusses conflict of interest between privileged class possessing decision-making positions in the board of directors and implementers working at the grassroots level at ANMOL (a non-governmental organization working for poor girls education in Baluchistan-hub of China–Pakistan Economic Corridor); it discusses the basis for formulation of psychological contracts and impact of its violation on stakeholder’s commitment and motivation; it discusses the implications of difference of opinion of both stakeholders regarding organizational vision and possible drawbacks of converting task conflict into interpersonal conflict on individuals, organization and end-users; it explores implications of exclusion of key stakeholders from organizational decision-making and its impact on organizational smooth working and sustainability; and it suggests a mechanism to avoid conversion of task conflict into interpersonal conflict and smooth functioning of an organization. Hence, this case discusses theories of conflict of interest between top-leadership and workforce, psychological contract and implications of its breach on employee motivation and organizational sustainability in the context of social development organizations. Complexity academic level: This case provides sufficient material to be discussed at master level courses (management sciences – master of business administration (MBA) level) such as human resource management (dynamics of psychological contract and conflict resolution), leadership and change management in social development organizations (social enterprises).

abstract={Theoretical basis: Financial accounting to assess stewardship: the case requires students to evaluate Thompson’s stewardship of McDonald’s, in part based on the company’s financial accounting information. Financial reporting performs an important societal role by helping control agency problems that arise from the separation of ownership and management. Since external stakeholders cannot “observe directly the extent and quality of managerial effort on their behalf […] the manager may be tempted to shirk […] blaming any deterioration of firm performance on factors beyond his/her control” (Scott, 2014, p. 23). However, although financial reporting helps hold managers accountable to shareholders, accounting information is not fully informative about managerial effort. For example, while net income provides useful information regarding the CEO’s stewardship, it is also “noisy,” due to recognition lags and other factors (Scott, 2014, p. 364). Efforts undertaken by Thompson in a particular period, such as marketing expenditures, might reduce current earnings, yet boost future profitability. Additionally, Thompson’s predecessor’s past efforts might have positive or negative effects on current earnings. Evaluating stewardship effectively involves considerable judgment, in addition to knowledge of financial accounting. The implication of poor firm performance is that the CEO is ineffective at formulating and implementing strategies and policies to enhance firm value (Dikolli et al., 2014). Specifically, it appears that missing earnings benchmarks matter more for relatively inexperienced CEOs. Don Thompson’s tenure of 33 months at McDonalds is 42 percent lower than median CEO tenure documented in academic research, where the median tenure of chief executives documented in large sample empirical studies is about 57 months (Dikolli et al., 2014). The evidence suggests that the longer a CEO serves, the less likely he is to be dismissed for performance-related reasons. This appears to be the result of the resolution of uncertainty about CEO’s ability and leads to subsequent declines in the level of monitoring by the Board of Directors. Performance evaluation and bias: a significant body of research explores the extent to which female managers are assessed differently than their male counterparts (Powell and Butterfield, 2002). For example, female CEOs face more threats from activist investors than male CEOs. Therefore, even after women achieve the highest managerial rank, they experience more professional challenges than their male counterparts (Gupta et al., 2018). However, the question of whether black CEOs are assessed differently is more challenging to answer empirically as a result of a smaller sample size (only one percent of S&P 500 companies are run by black CEOs). Our case attempts to develop the inference that if female CEOs are subject to bias, analogous forces are likely at work when black CEOs are assessed. Recent evidence further suggests that business students sometimes demonstrate bias in making assessments (Mengel et al., 2018). The authors discuss these findings – as well as strategies for including them in the case discussion – in the “Teaching Strategy” section herein below. Research methodology: The case was written from the public record surrounding the appointment of Don Thompson and McDonald’s company filings. The record includes articles from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, as well as local and industry publications. Case overview/synopsis: The case examines the role of financial accounting in evaluating CEO performance in the context of the appointment of McDonald’s first African-American chief executive and his subsequent two-and-a-half years on the job. The case deepens students’ understanding of the link between financial reporting and stewardship, while highlighting the subjectivity inherent in assessing managerial performance, particularly over relatively short time periods. As students analyze the case, they must consider the extent to which a firm’s results are attributable to luck vs skill. We use “skill” to refer to CEO effort and other controllable factors, while “luck” refers to exogenous factors, such as macroeconomic conditions. Assessing stewardship is of practical significance. It allows pay to be better aligned with performance and empowers stakeholders to identify when a change of leadership may be warranted. The case may also be used to spur reflection, in an applied context, on the importance of being alert to unconscious bias, even when evaluating seemingly objective financial reporting data. Recent research, discussed herein, suggests that business students sometimes exhibit bias when making assessments. Complexity academic level: The case should be included in discussions of corporate governance, executive compensation and the role of accounting information in efficient contracting. It is appropriate in intermediate financial accounting courses for undergraduates, introductory graduate accounting courses, or other courses with an element of financial statement analysis. Standard introductory accounting textbooks offer helpful supplementary reading for students. Horngren et al.’s (2014) book, Introduction to Financial Accounting (12th ed.), Pearson, London, provides an overview of the income statement and its role in assessing performance (see Chapter 2) as well as a useful discussion on evaluating the components and trends of a business (see Chapter 12). More advanced students may benefit from the in-depth discussion of earnings quality, operating income and non-operating income found in Chapter 4 of Intermediate Accounting (9th ed.), McGraw Hill Education, New York by Spiceland et al. (2018). © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={INTRODUCTION The title “in-house counsel movement” has been used since the end of the 1980s to describe what began as an American phenomenon entailing the numeric growth, increased prestige, and growing professional value afforded to lawyers working within company legal departments on the company’s legal matters (Rosen 1989; Wilkins 2012). Rosen focuses on how corporate lawyers went from being “kept” counsel in the 1920s, to “tame lawyers” in the 1950s, to “in-house counsel” in the 1980s. Nor was Rosen alone in marking this transition. Beginning in the mid-1980s, scholars studying the legal profession began to note that inside legal departments, and the legal executives leading them, were increasingly valued within their companies and the legal profession as a whole. Chayes and Chayes write: Not only have [in-house counsel] offices grown in size, but in importance as well. The general counsel sits close to the top of the corporate hierarchy as a member of senior management. There is a comparable increase in the importance and complexity of matters dealt with internally. (Chayes and Chayes 1985, 277) Indeed, Chayes and Chayes found that legal directors in large US corporations were gaining relevance within internal corporate hierarchies as they began taking part in the strategic decision-making process of the company. Many were being integrated into higher levels in the corporate hierarchy as members of management, with some even being included on the company’s board of directors (Coates et al. 2011). Early studies of the changing role of in-house counsel also showed that there was a trend to begin carrying out new types of legal services and implementing new methods when managing conflict. For instance, legal departments began performing new activities, such as preventive legal consulting by foreseeing potential conflicts by implementing long-term planning and establishing managing plans for litigation as well as managing legal services by outsourced law firms (Chayes and Chayes 1985, 200). In the almost three decades since this initial work, David B. Wilkins has argued that this the trend of enhancing the value of in-house counsels in the United States and around the world is not over (Wilkins 2012). More specifically, he argues that the prestige of in-house counsel and, in particularly GCs, continues to rise. He notes, that in-house counsel increasingly interact with top company executives, including the board, when advising and solving legal needs in their companies. © Cambridge University Press 2018.},

abstract={This Article provides a legal overview and analysis of the benefits associated with the adoption of a staggered board of directors by Italian banks and public companies. While there is a widespread opposition to staggered boards among U.S. scholars and investors - being such device a powerful antitakeover measure in the American legal system since directors belonging to a U.S. staggered board may be removed only "for cause" - this Article explains the reasons why staggered boards should be implemented by Italian banks and public companies considering the significant distinctions between the U.S. and the European legal frameworks in this area. Taking into account the new banking governance principles recently introduced by CRD IV and by its implementing measures, this Article explains how the establishment of staggered boards by Italian credit institutions and listed companies may allow them (i) to exclude the risk of potential discontinuities in the management's action, which are inappropriate in corporations of such complexity and systemic relevance, (ii) to facilitate the initial induction and training of the newly appointed directors and officers, who would benefit from the expertise of other members of the board with longer experience, (iii) to strengthen and foster the institutional dialogue between the board and the shareholders, aimed at achieving an adequate collective knowledge, skills and experience of the management body, and finally (iv) to attract more capital from professional investors, granting them the possibility to appoint their representatives in the board on an annual basis.},

abstract={Purpose Many corporate managers, with the aid of the board of directors, discovered that they could provide themselves with guaranteed or excessive compensation by manipulating the terms of stock option grants that were included in their compensation packages. This paper seeks to examine the legal, tax, and accounting issues that have evolved because of these suspect illegal activities. Design/methodology/approach The author presents the theory behind performance-based compensation that is the basis for employee stock option grants. The author then examines regulations, judicial theory, and court cases to determine the current legal status of backdating, spring loading, or bullet dodging of executive stock option grants. Findings The current legal environment has made it difficult for executives to continue the practice of manipulating stock option grants without falling under the ire of regulators and shareholders. However, a question remains whether executives that manipulated stock option grants in the past will be found criminally liable for their acts. Practical implications The paper's review of the discourse on the legality of corporate executives enhancing their compensation packages shows the complexity of detecting and regulating this type of suspect activity. Originality/value This paper presents a contemporaneous discussion and data on legal and regulatory changes that resulted from management malfeasance of executive compensation. © Copyright - 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

abstract={Scholarly investigations on the board of directors, although intense from the mid-1990s onward, did not lead to entirely convincing results. This study proposes discussion on building a multidisciplinary and integrated theoretical framework able to capture the complexity and distinctive dimensions of the board as a group decision-making process. This is achieved through an essay developed from analytical and descriptive review of the literature. A synthesis on board research is presented, aiming to understand theoretical models lenses used to study corporate governance issues. The strengths and weaknesses of these models are pointed out, and their influence on board investigation is observed. This essay concludes by proposing a research agenda that considers the addition of psychological and sociological approaches to economic models of the analysis of group decision-making.},

Neither of the decision analysis models presented to the respective Boards of Directors was at all complex mathematically but they were highly influential on the decision-making processes. Indeed both were critical to the decisions made at those times.

abstract={The literature on nonprofit governance and boards has grown substantially during the past 50 years as researchers from a variety of disciplines and fields have studied governance systems and processes to examine how they are organized, the practices they employ, and their relations with and impacts on nonprofits. This essay offers a domain-based narrative review of the research on the governance of nonprofit organizations and how it has developed over these 50 years. Building on literature reviews and a Delphi study, we summarize the progression of nonprofit governance research, employ a multi-dimensional framework to summarize and assess the state of the field, and offer recommendations for future study. We find the increasingly multinational and multicultural literature of the field has become more rich, nuanced, and increasingly inclusive of contingency, complexity, paradox, and the diverse theoretical perspectives that will enhance our understanding of nonprofit governance. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={Purpose: This study aims to examine the link between boards and audit committees and firm performance in Kuwaiti listed firms in the context of recent and extensive corporate governance regulatory reform. Design/methodology/approach: Panel data regression analysis with fixed effects and clustered standard errors of firm performance for 61–97 listed industrial and services firms in Kuwait over a seven-year period. The dependent variables are the returns on assets and equity, the debt-to-equity ratio and leverage and Tobin’s Q and the independent variables comprise board of directors and audit committee characteristics, including size, the number of meetings and the numbers of independent and outside board and expert committee members. Firm size, subsidiary status and cash flow serve as control variables. Findings: Mixed results with respect to the characteristics of the board of directors. Board size and independent and outsider board members positively relate only to Tobin’s Q and insiders only to debt to equity. For audit committee characteristics, committee size, independence and expertise positively relate to the return on equity and committee size and expertise only to Tobin’s Q. Of the five performance measures considered, board and audit committee characteristics together best determine Tobin’s Q. Research limitations/implications: Data from a single country limits generalisability and control variables necessarily limited in a developing market context. Need for qualitative insights into corporate governance reform as a complement to conventional quantitative analysis. In combining accounting and market information, Tobin’s Q appears best able to recognise the performance benefits of good corporate governance in terms of internal organisational change. Practical implications: The recent corporate governance code and guidelines reforms exert a mixed impact on firm performance, with audit committees, not boards, of most influence. But recent reforms implied most change to boards of directors. One suggestion is that non-market reform may have been unneeded given existing market pressure on listed firms and firms anticipating regulatory change. Social implications: Kuwait’s corporate governance reforms codified corporate governance practices already in place among many of its firms in pursuit of organisational legitimacy, and while invoking substantial change to audit committees, involved minor change to firm performance, at least in the short term. Some firms may also have delisted in expectation of stronger corporate governance requirements. Regardless, these direct and indirect processes both improved the overall quality of listed firm corporate governance and performance in Kuwait. Originality/value: Seminal analysis of corporate governance reforms in Kuwait, which have rapidly progressed from no corporate governance code and guidelines to an initially voluntary and then compulsory regime. Only known analysis to incorporate both board of directors and audit committee characteristics. Reveals studies of the corporate governance–firm performance relationship may face difficulty in model specification, and empirical significance, given the complexity of corporate governance codes and guidelines, leads in changing firm behaviour and self-selection of firms into and out of regulated markets. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: Considering corporate governance (CG hereinafter) practices' variety across Anglo-American and European countries, this study relies on contingency and complexity theories to investigate the effect of environmental sustainability performance (ESP hereinafter) on shareholder value under various configurations of board of directors (BoD hereinafter), firm and country characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: The author used the Thomson Reuters Environment Pillar Score (ASSET4) and the Total Shareholder Return to assess ESP and shareholder value respectively. The author applied a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA hereinafter) to an unbalanced panel of 2,284 observations from 486 European and Anglo-American non-financial listed firms over the period 2016–2020. Findings: The author found a positive association between ESP and shareholder value and he displayed notable differences between Anglo-American and European economies regarding causal predictors of this positive association. Within European firms operating under civil law code where investor protection is low and family ownership is widespread, ESP creates shareholder value under configurations of causal predictors that significantly differ from those of their Anglo-American peers. The author's findings are robust to different identification strategies. Practical implications: This study assists researchers, practitioners, shareholders and policymakers the significant roles that BoD diversity, organisational and institutional traits are jointly playing as determinants of the ESP-shareholder value relationship. Originality/value: The author's study offers a more encompassing, complete and theoretically richer picture of the key drivers and outcomes of ESP. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This book will explore a new approach to airport planning that better captures the complexities and velocity of change in our contemporary world. As a result, it will lead to higher performing airports for users, business partners, investors and other stakeholders. This is especially pertinent since airports will need to come back better from the Covid-19 pandemic. The book explains the importance of articulating a clear strategy, based on a rigorous analysis of the competitive landscape while avoiding the pitfalls of ambiguity and 'virtue signalling'. Having done so, demand forecasts can be developed that resemble S-curves, not simple straight lines, that reflect strategic opportunities and threats from which a master plan can be developed to allocate land and capital in a way that maximizes return on assets and social licence. The second distinctive feature of this book is the premise that planning an airport as an island, a fortress even, does not work anymore given how interconnected airports are with other components of the transportation system, the economies and communities they serve and the rapid pace of social and technological change. In summary, the book argues that airport planning needs to move beyond its traditional boundaries. The book is replete with real examples from airports of all sizes around the world and includes practical advice and tools for executives and managers. It is recommended reading for individuals working in the airport business or the broader air transport industry, members of airports' board of directors, who may be new to the business, elected officials, policy makers and urban planners in jurisdictions hosting or adjacent to airports, regulators, economic development professionals and, finally, students. © 2022 Mike Brown.

abstract={Severance packages are granted to senior executives to mitigate management problems, such as risk aversion. When the incentive plan stipulates the acquisition of control as a hypothesis for triggering the indemnity, the benefit takes the form of a golden parachute and works as a defensive measure against hostile acquisitions by increasing the cost of the operation for the acquirer. It is understood that the evaluation of the board of directors performance in the executive pay approval must be based on the convenience of the instrument for social interest, which requires an institutional analysis. Both the ownership structure and the market for corporate control are relevant elements to determine if the incentive seeks to fulfill the purpose for which it is being planned, especially when the threat of hostile acquisitions is used as a justification for implementation. Therefore, based on the HRT Case, the severance pay is analyzed in observance of the Brazilian capital market characteristics. Although it does not represent all the complexity of the issue, the case chosen is a portrait of a specific reality and offers important thoughts for an efficient regulation of executive pay in Brazil. This work intends to demonstrate that Comissão de Valores Mobiliários [CVM] took into account purely theoretical benefits of the severance pay and did not incorporate the brazilian stock market specificities in the analysis, a decision that brought losses to HRT Participações em Petróleo S/A shareholders. © 2022 Fundacao Getulio Vargas, Escola de Direito de Sao Paulo.

abstract={Purpose: In this paper, the impact of stock-based compensation and further the joint effects of stock-based compensation and investor sentiment on pension discount rate choice is examined. Design/methodology/approach: The hypotheses is tested using fixed effects models and instrumental variable analysis where pension discount rate is the dependent variable, and stock-based compensation and investor sentiment are our variables of interest. Findings: It was found that pension discount rate is negatively associated with managers' stock-based compensation. Further analysis indicates that managers with larger stock-based compensation tend to adjust down their pension discount rates in higher (smaller) degree, responding to high (low) investor sentiment. Practical implications: The findings provide important insights into how managers use pension discount rates to engage in earnings management. Understanding these relationships has implications for interpreting pension numbers reported in the financial statements and designing pension accounting rules that minimize the possibility that managers take advantage of the complexity associated with pension accounting to influence the reported earnings and executive compensation. Moreover, the findings suggest the need for increased attention from boards of directors, auditors and regulators to reported pension liabilities and service costs, especially for firms paying higher proportion of stock-based compensation to managers and during periods of high investor sentiment. Originality/value: The findings contribute to the extant literature by identifying the joint impacts of stock-based compensation and investor sentiment as incentives for pension discount rate manipulation. The empirical results of this study also have important implications for corporate governance and regulation. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Learning outcomes: This case study aims to ensure that, students should be able to recognise the behaviours that influence the in-member out-member categorisation that transpires in the workplace, both from the leader’s perspective and that of the followers; determine and understand the relevance of forming interpersonal relationships in the workplace and that interpersonal relationships create fundamentally positive or negative work experiences and impact on career opportunities in the workplace; gain an understanding of the internal bias and subjective comfort that leaders must actively overcome to establish an environment in which the entire team becomes in-group members; and be able to assess the contextual variables that contribute to the negative or positive aggravation of the leader–member exchange. Case overview/synopsis: It was 16 October 2014, and Nonkululeko Gobodo, Executive Chair of accounting firm SizweNtsalubaGobodo, was looking to her younger sister, Notemba Dlova, for emotional support, as she sought to address an important issue that was on the agenda of the firm’s board of directors’ meeting the following day. Tensions between her and Victor Sekese, Chief Executive Officer of the firm, were mounting, and a number of the directors were unhappy with the status quo. “How do you think I should address the issue?” she asked Dlova. Both sisters knew that at stake was Gobodo’s future at the firm she had battled so hard to build up in the face of racial and gender stereotypes. Complexity academic level: The case study is appropriate for use in a range of postgraduate courses aimed at Master’s in Management and Master of Business Administration (MBA)-level students. It is also suitable for use in postgraduate diplomas in business and executive education short courses. Supplementary materials: Teaching notes are available for educators only.

abstract={Theoretical basis: Later in the discussion, the options for long run strategy in dealing with a possible takeover offer and other strategic options can be discussed by the class. Lack of familiarity by students with the role of the outside potential acquirer of the camp (in this case, a hotel chain) and the lack of familiarity with the role of an investor who is a family investor, who may wish to sell stock and use the proceeds for another purpose, or a small investor who invests because he or she uses the camp and takes advantage of the stockholder’s discount will probably preclude role playing, except in executive MBA classes where students have sufficient experience in possible takeover situations or in investment management, Emphasis should probably be placed on discussing the major issues, such as social and cultural issues and on marketing and public relations issues and on financial issues, including the options available in the event of a possible takeover effort. All of these issues are impacted fully by the COVID-19 pandemic. Research methodology: Instructors will need to play an active role in teaching this case. It is recommended that the instructor give a short lecture or discussion at the beginning as to how a camp such as Camp Teddy functions. The authors recommend that the instructor then begin the case discussion by asking students questions about such issues as social and cultural issues and marketing and public relations issues. Case overview/synopsis: Camp Teddy is a seasonal camp for families in rural Connecticut adjacent to New York City and suburbs in New York and Connecticut. It is technically a for-profit organization but operates more like a nonprofit organization because many of the campers own shares and have used the camp sometimes for several generations. The camp has traditions that are liked by many of the shareholders and campers. Although net income has increased in the past year, there does not seem to be enough funds to support necessary capital expenditures to improve facilities for the future. The largest stockholder has recently died. His immediate heirs’ control 300 of the 1,000 shares and other family members control 400 shares with the remaining 300 shares in the hands of small shareholders, many of whom use the camp each summer. A large hotel chain is interested in possibly acquiring the camp through a buyout or perhaps a hostile takeover, with a potential large gain to shareholders. The board of directors must consider a number of issues to insure good occupancy of the camp in the future and must decide what to do about a potential takeover attempt. Complexity academic level: This case can be used in several courses, including investment management, hospitality management, corporate finance and business strategy. There are ethical and societal issues in the case, so that the case might also be used in courses looking at business, environment or business ethics. The case is best used at the graduate level, but it might be suitable for some advanced undergraduate courses. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This study investigates how firm structure, chief executive officer (CEO) power, and federal legislation influence hiring of corporate directors from a diverse background. Combining the value-in-diversity hypothesis and the similarity-attraction paradigm, we examine the impact of economically rational (i.e., business need) and social preference (i.e., similar-to-me bias) drivers of board diversity post-the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX). Using a sample of S&P 1500 firms from an eight-year period spanning SOX, we find that SOX is positively correlated with board diversity. Although SOX was not intended to increase board diversity, the changes it put in place have subsequently facilitated more board diversity. Results show that the economically rational predictor (firm operational complexity) had a positive and statistically significant effect on board diversity pre-SOX but that effect disappeared post-SOX. Meanwhile, CEO power, a social preference inhibitor of board diversity, had a negative and statistically significant relationship with board diversity pre-SOX which also disappeared post-SOX. It appears that SOX has mitigated both economically rational drivers to want more diversity as well as social preference drivers to want less diversity. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

abstract={Learning outcomes: The main objectives of this case are to provide an opportunity for case users to understand the organisational governance framework in a farmers' association and how to build an effective organisational board. More specifically, the teaching objectives of this case are as follows: to provide an overview of the functions of different types of governance structures in a farmers' association. To understand the importance of good governance practices in a farmers' association and for its stakeholders. To relate democratic theory, stakeholder theory, agency theory and stewardship theory with the governance practices of a farmers' association. To critically evaluate the board governance in a farmers' association and recommend measures to enhance the practices. Case overview/synopsis: The teaching case presents the governance practices in a farmers' association in Malaysia, ZIX-PPK and the various governance challenges that emerged in the PPK subsequent to the appointment of politically affiliated directors. Prior to 2019, ZIX-PPK was an outstanding PPK under the helm of the General Manager, Khadijah. The PPK had continually been recognised as an exceptional and excellent PPK by the Farmers' Organisation Authority and the Muda Agricultural Development Authority. However, the Arahan Pendaftar Bil 1/2019 required changes to the governance structures of ZIX-PPK, with five new directors being appointed by the minister. The appointment threatened the independence and autonomy of ZIX-PPK and affected the dynamic of the board of directors. Khadijah had to search for measures that could improve the board governance in ZIX-PPK. The names, in this case, had been altered but the details were based on an actual event. The data were collected through interviews with key players and with reference to the minutes and other documentation of ZIX-PPK. Complexity academic level: The teaching case can be used by students in higher education institutions at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The case may also be relevant for training purposes to farmers' associations and any non-profit organisations. Subject code: CSS 1: Accounting and Finance.

abstract={Learning outcomes: Students learn to evaluate a firm’s growth strategies with the aim of establishing long-term business sustainability. Students will examine the impact of external macro-environmental factors that influence firm growth in an emerging market context. Using this case, students will learn how to apply a resource-based view to a firm’s offering by comparing and identifying the competitive advantage of the internal resources of the firm. Using this case, students can apply the principle of strategic fit by strategically analyzing the opportunities and threats in the external environment, while taking into account the firm’s internal strengths and weaknesses. Case overview/synopsis: This case outlines the strategic, macro-environmental and marketing challenges that the Cape Town-based private higher education institution, Red & Yellow Creative School of Business, faced as it entered its 25th year of existence. In 2019, Red & Yellow had its roots in industry and had done well historically to cement that bond through the creation of successful alumni and the constant innovation of its higher education offering. Two weeks before having to present a detailed five-year growth strategy plan to the board of directors, Rob Stokes, the Director and Chairman of Red & Yellow, was faced with a multitude of decisions pertaining to the sustainable growth of the school. Recent growth patterns showed that programs with lower profit margins, such as classroom-based full-time programs, had experienced double-digit growth while student numbers for higher gross profit offerings, such as online and executive education programs had started to decline. Another challenge that the school faced was the need for its students to future-proof their careers in a world where artificial intelligence and machine learning threatened their careers and jobs. As such, Red & Yellow was confronted with one central strategic problem: How to grow strategically in the short term while developing a sustainable and scalable growth strategy for the school in the long term. Complexity academic level: This case could work well as part of an executive education course, as well as a strategic management course for master’s degree or Master of Business Administration students.

abstract={An established succession planning program for the identification and grooming of its next leader helps maintain the continuity of firm strategy and leadership style, which influences long-term firm performance and viability. Disclosure of succession planning information may alleviate investors’ doubts about whether the firm has a succession planning plan, while it may increase competition for CEO candidates, leading to increases in the cost of securing qualified candidates. This study explores what determines firms’ decisions to provide this disclosure using firms that initiate CEO succession planning disclosure in a given year and their control firms. We find that firms are more likely to initiate the disclosure of CEO succession planning when 1) segment concentration (negatively related to organizational complexity) becomes lower, 2) the board of directors becomes more independent, 3) the CEO has reached the retirement age of 64, 4) the CEO becomes more important relative to other executive officers in the industry labor market, 5) the number of analysts following (reflecting external monitoring) increases, and 6) CEO tenure (reflecting CEO entrenchment) declines. Overall, our findings suggest that the disclosure of CEO succession planning is motivated by investor demand for a smooth transition among top management and enhanced transparency in CEO succession planning. © 2020, Korean Accounting Association.

abstract={The aim of this paper is to review the role of board size as part of the corporate governance system. This paper discusses one aspect of corporate governance, namely, boards, in the Indonesian context. Using the literature review method, this paper explores factors that need to be considered to determine the optimal number of boards, especially in Indonesia. We explore some determinants of board size, such as complexity and leverage, ownership structure, and financial ratio support. The results reveal that an understanding of the differences found in the two-tier board model helps us understand that the different functions of the board of commissioners and the board of directors require different test treatments from countries that adhere to one-tier systems. A review of the relationship between board size and company performance is expected to provide the corporate governance literature with insights into optimizing the sizes of boards that can improve company performance, both in terms of boards of commissioners and boards of directors. This paper proposes the simultaneous testing of board size’s relationship with company performance. The results of this study are expected to make a more real contribution about the effect of board size on company performance. © Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.},

abstract={Boards of directors are complex systems, and it is imperative to understand what the contextual forces are that shape the direction and make-up of boards. This Research Handbook provides inspiration for researchers and practitioners interested in the manifold dimensions and facets of context surrounding boards of directors. The contributions identify the complexity and multiplicity of contexts in which boards of directors work and operate, as well as indicating how board members interact with, and influence their contexts. The chapters explore national and institutional differences, divergent understandings of board requirements, climate change and boards’ duties, transformation due to digitalisation, family firms, and micro-contextual dynamics affecting boards and their decisions. This Research Handbook promotes board accountability, questions the relative position of companies in society, and reconsiders governance from a multiple context, multi-actor perspective. Building a greater understanding of the main issues and theories surrounding boards of directors, this Research Handbook will be ideal for students and scholars of business and governance. Practitioners and policy makers can also find material for their evolving frameworks. © Jonas Gabrielsson, Wafa Khlif and Sibel Yamak 2019. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The author meant to deepen the inspirations that lead to the evolution of a Public Health Care Enterprise. He, mainly, stressed the struggles of the Public Enterprise while perceiving the vision given by the Ruling Public Entity. The Public Enterprise pursues general interest’s targets operating via laws and rules to be converted into infrastractures and services through the performance of the free market. On the opposite, this free market, made of companies and professionals pursues mainly economical targets. To fulfil such a complex task the Public Entity has to take advantage from a management capable of overcoming the mere culture of the act and pairing with a culture that relies on relationship and value-creating behaviour. In this specific case, for an Health Care Public Company, the value is intended as the patient’s welfare. Fulfilling this challenge has a high degree of complexity, as Mintzberg has been stressing too, mainly for the interactions of different stakeholders (Board of Directors, Managers, Nurses, Doctors), among whom some are closer to the patients, while others are closer to the pure company businesses. The author has described the practical case of an incentive system implemented in an inhouse company which, in order to empower management figure like the Responsible of the Proceedings, has set a time & cost saving based MBO, giving different leverages in order to perceive it. The author has finally extended his analysis on the different ways to inspire/stimulate the management as training, project management and leadership. © 2019, University of Urbino.

abstract={The article analyzes the results of an empirical study of mechanisms of regulation and coordination of interests among the participants of corporate governance at mediumsized industrial corporations in Tambov Region, Russia. The study was carried out by means of a content-analysis technique applied to annual corporate reports. The study summarizes the basic categories of content analysis, the frequency of the manifestations of signs by category, assessment of relations to the semantic content of signs. To verify results of content analysis the questionnaire of subjects and participants of corporate management was conducted. Survey was carried out on the basis of the target sample. In the course of the content-analysis, generalized data relating to the use of federal and internal legal norms applied to the medium-sized industrial corporations were obtained. A high degree of negative estimations of legal support of corporate activity was noted, which confirms the imperfection of the legislation, the existing gaps in it, contradictory legal provisions, and the complexity of regulatory framework. The survey revealed that the regulation of internal corporate activity is based on a limited list of corporate documents: the Charter of the Company and the Regulations of the Board of Directors. Interaction of participants of corporate relations on the basis of contracts has common flaws in their negotiation. Measures which can come at non-fulfillment of contracts on different circumstances that can create conditions for the conflict of interests of the parties aren’t registered in them. Questionnaire allowed to specify the characteristics of activity of bodies of corporate management received during the content analysis. The established average level of corporate governance within the industrial corporations of the Tambov Region provides the satisfactory level of balance of interactions of participants of the corporate relations. Level of protection of the property rights of key shareholders in general remains stable, and the level of protection of the rights of minority shareholders is estimated as satisfactory, control of Board of directors of administrative activity of top management is estimated above the average level. The survey confirmed relevance of a problem of the conflicts for average industrial corporations. The conflicts of interests most often happen between three groups of participants: shareholders and top managers; management and personnel; with competitors. The conflicts of interests in average corporations are overcome on the basis of priority satisfaction of interests, first of all - major shareholders, in the second turn - top managers. Interests of suppliers, local authorities, the personnel, small shareholders are poorly considered. The conflicts of interests are resolved on the basis of standards of the federal legislation, internal corporate documents, and contracts with constant partners. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={This study investigates the role of the company secretary in ensuring and promoting proper Corporate Governance (CG) in public and private owned South African companies, so as to educate companies on their significance in reducing corporate scandals. The study followed a mixed research paradigm in which qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection were used. Fifty questionnaires were sent to company secretaries of different business sectors giving a response rate of 78% with four of the participants telephonically interviewed to gather qualitative data. The study confirmed that the company secretary still plays a significant role in promoting CG by giving support and advising the board and its directors on CG matters. The results further show that some company secretaries are involved in director selection, performance evaluation and implement induction, training and/or professional development to strengthen the company’s governance practices. Through the use of the Companies Act and the Kings report the company secretary ensures directors are kept abreast of relevant legislative and regulatory developments. It was observed that the company secretary ensures good information flow between the board, directors and stakeholders and keeps record of all conflicts of interest. Though the company secretary is appointed by the board they can whistle blow any misconduct under the protection of the Protected Disclosure Act, thus ensuring effectiveness of their role. Despite the fact that some of the company secretaries are facing challenges due to the ever evolving and increasing complexity of their roles, there has been evolution with regards to legislation, greater transparency, better governance and improved investor expectation. This study enriches company secretaries with knowledge of their expected role in CG. © 2015 Virtus interpress.},

abstract={In this study, we investigate the relations between CEO stock options and analysts′ earnings forecast accuracy and bias. We argue that a higher level of stock options may induce managers to undertake riskier projects, to change and/or reallocate their effort, and to possibly engage in gaming (such as opportunistic earnings and disclosure management) and hypothesize that these managerial behaviors will result in an increase in the complexity of forecasting and, hence, in less accurate analysts′ forecasts. We also posit that analysts′ optimistic forecast bias will increase as the level of stock options pay increases. We reason that as forecast complexity increases with stock options pay, analysts, needing greater access to management′s information to produce accurate forecasts, have incentives to increase the optimistic bias in their forecasts. Alternatively, a higher level of stock options pay may lead to improved disclosure because it better aligns managers’ and shareholders′ interests. The improved disclosure, in turn, may result in more accurate and less biased analysts′ forecasts. Using ordinary least squares estimation, we test these hypotheses relating the level of CEO stock options pay to analysts′ forecast accuracy and bias on a sample of firms from the Standard & Poor′s ExecuComp database over the period 1993–2003. Our OLS models relate forecast accuracy and forecast bias (the dependent variables) to CEO stock options (the independent variable) and controls for earnings characteristics, firm characteristics, and forecast characteristics. We measure forecast accuracy as negative one times the absolute value of the difference between forecasted and actual earnings scaled by beginning of period stock price and forecast bias as forecasted minus actual earnings scaled by beginning of period stock price. We control for differences in earnings characteristics by including earnings volatility, whether the firm has a loss, and earnings surprise; for differences in firm characteristics by including firm size, growth (measured as book-to-market ratio, percentage change in total assets, and percentage change in annual sales), and corporate governance quality (measured as percentage of shares outstanding owned by the CEO, whether the CEO is also chairman of the board of directors, number of annual board meetings, and whether directors are awarded stock options); and for differences in forecast characteristics by including analyst following and analyst forecast dispersion. In addition, the models include controls for industry and year. We use four measures of options: new options, existing exercisable options, existing unexercisable options, and total options (sum of the previous three), all scaled by total number of shares outstanding, and estimate two models for each dependent variable, one including total options and the other including new options, existing exercisable options, and existing unexercisable options. We also use both contemporaneous as well as lagged values of options in our main tests. Our results indicate that analysts′ earnings forecast accuracy decreases and forecast optimism increases as the level of stock options (particularly new options and existing exercisable options) in CEO pay increases. These findings suggest that the incentive alignment effects of stock options are more than offset by the investment, effort allocation, and gaming incentives induced by stock options grants to CEOs. Given that analysts′ forecasts are an important source of information to capital markets, our finding of a decline in the quality of the information provided by analysts has implications for the level and variability of stock prices. It also has implications for information asymmetry and cost of capital, as well as for valuation models that rely on analysts′ earnings forecasts. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.},

abstract={Despite the growing interest in IJVs and their governance, systematic research is limited on the board of directors and their roles in international joint ventures in emerging markets. In this study, we draw from corporate governance research that suggests that the levels of control and collaboration by boards are influenced by organizational complexity. While joint ventures possess several similarities compared to unitary firms, they also have unique sources of complexity given the fact that two or more international partners collaborate within JVs under an incomplete contract. Based on a sample of 114 IJVs, we argue and show four separate conditions that influence the functions that boards undertake as well as how control and collaboration as two separate functions are interrelated. Our findings address calls for research to open the black box of what boards actually do as well as to bring corporate governance theory to new organizational forms such as joint ventures. © 2015 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Globalization of labour and capital markets and also development and increased use of information technology, as well as the increasing complexity of business transactions influenced the emergence of new and complex risks that companies face every day. In parallel with the growing complexity of risks the expectations for their effective management are also rising. Risk management or defining strategies to deal with risks the company is exposed to become a necessary condition and prerequisite for the achievement of company objectives. One of the most important factors that influence the efficiency and effectiveness of the risk management process is the establishment of appropriate oversight of the process itself. Although the monitoring of the risk management process is the responsibility of the Board, recently, it has been delegated to the Audit Committee and thereby its role is becoming more important and the scope of its responsibilities and tasks is expanding. Regardless of whether is it the continental system of corporate governance, which is characterized by a two tier governance structure (with Supervisory and Management Board) or the Anglo-American system of corporate governance in which the role of the management and Supervisory Board integrates into a single Board of Directors with executive and non-executive directors, the Audit Committee is a specialized subcommittee which is being delegated with appropriate supervisory functions. The primary functions of the Audit Committee are usually associated with the internal controls and risk management, financial reporting, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and the relevant issues related to the process of external and internal audit. This chapter discusses the relevant features of Audit Committees in the system of corporate governance with particular emphasis on the role of Audit Committees in the risk management process. The main research objective is to analyze the role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee in enterprise risk management and relevant aspects of cooperation with other participants in the process, primarily with internal auditors, exploring at the same time their significance. This chapter summarises the current understanding of the Audit Committee role in the enterprise risk management by analyzing previously published research. Research findings show that the new rules extend the duties and responsibilities of the Audit Committee on risk management. Expertise and information awareness of the Audit Committee is imposed as a necessary prerequisite of their effective functioning in this area, but the main drawback that they are attributed. In order to effectively discharge their responsibilities, Audit Committees should, along with the support of governance structures, cooperate with functions such as internal audit, which could be a significant source of information necessary for their work. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Based on it, we contrast on the frauds of private company and non-private company. We found that the characteristics of private company led to this fraud phenomenon. The private company fraud usually is positive correlation to stock holdings of executives and chairman of the Board. In non-private company, the Board of Directors and Board of Supervisors can restrict with the frauds. In addition, the Director's salary or Independent Directors allowance is negative correlation to the frauds. This can partly explain the complexity and conflict in overall samples. ©2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Banks, particularly those considered too big to fail, pose a particular governance challenge, especially for taxpayers who face an undiversifiable risk of being the final backstop of the financial system. The nexus of bank governance is the board of directors, but they have proven inadequate in controlling the riskiness of bank activities, an outcome due both of the complexity of modern banks, and because boards are uncertain about what is expected of them. Using an interdisciplinary approach from law and accounting, we propose a two-step procedure to improve bank governance. First, we give bank directors an explicit standard to assess the outcome of their actions: the Prudent Investor rule which is the requirement for trusts. Adopting the Prudent Investor rule would return to director's responsibility to control the risks of banking activities. To enforce the higher standard, we propose to use disclosure as a disciplining mechanism. We base the new disclosure regime on Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that requires managers to implement controls over the firm's financial reporting processes and to publicly attest to their effectiveness. This section failed to prevent the credit crisis because it was too narrowly focused. We recommend that the provision be broadened to encompass governance controls in general, and that responsibility for disclosure be placed on the bank board rather than on managers. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

abstract={According to the commerce nowadays, technology is very important to respond all business requirements effectively including policies, strategies, perceptions, and regulations. Due to these concerns, it arisen IT governance which is becoming well-known issue. IT governance has gained high attention from board of directors and top management globally in order to meet organization's strategy and achieve business goals by delivering value to the business and minimizing risks. Therefore, it is complicated for them to handle different dilemmas and concentrate on prospect projects with multidimensional benefits of organizations to improve IT infrastructure and resource flexibility by aligning with IT governance frameworks. Moreover, these frameworks support IT infrastructure and resource flexibility with business. Thus, organizations gain higher business competitiveness. It is necessity to have IT processes to support in IT governance implementation. Nonetheless, there are different IT processes with complexity which affect to IT governance frameworks. Consequently, the emerged results of successful IT governance frameworks implementation are varied. They have resulted in considerable literature on perception of IT infrastructure and resource flexibility which IT governance could be effectively implemented. This research is driven to study the factors which make IT governance frameworks operate steadily. It applies a case study approach with qualitative interpretive research methodology. This paper expressively leads to the in progress development of theoretical base for the critical success factors of successful IT governance implementation processes. Moreover, it proposes to deliver a recommendation and criterion to leaderships for complete analysis in the success of IT governance implementation.},

abstract={The board of directors is seen as the central governance instrument, promoting interaction between stakeholders and promoting high performance, organization sustainability and return to investors. The practices and strategic definitions of corporative governance are considered of great importance today for corporations, due to the size and to the complexity of their structures (like M _ Forms structures) and the different forms in which they are presented: in networks, associations, partnerships, mergers and acquisitions. The aim of this article is to analyze the constitution of boards of directors, based on their attributes, and the impacts of this classification on the roles and responsibilities of the directors in Brazilian companies. For this, a quantitative survey was performed in the 300 largest companies in Brazil listed in BOVESPA - stock exchange in capital market. The results found point to a strong correlation of some attributes of the directors of the researched firms with the roles and responsibilities of the board, in relation to strategic, control, and institutional dimensions.},

A civil money penalty is intended as more than a mere remedial action. See 12 U.S.C. §1818(i)(2)(G); http://www.occ.treas.gov/ftp/bulletin/98-32.txt, Interagency Policy Regarding the Assessment of Civil Money Penalties by the Federal Financial Institutions Regulatory Agencies, attached to OCC Bulletin 98-32, July 24, 1998, available at; U.S. 132, 165 (1891). The Court further observed that the directors were "entitled under law to commit the banking business, as defined, to their duly-authorized officers, but this does not absolve them from the duty of reasonable supervision, nor ought they to be permitted to be shielded from liability because of want of knowledge of wrong-doing, if that ignorance is the result ofgross inattention...."; Id at 165-166 (emphasis added); (1997) Atherton V. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, , The latter statement could be read to suggest that the standard for liability would be gross negligence rather than simple negligence. The Supreme Court in 519 U.S. 213, 220 later observed that the lower courts had interpreted the Briggs' standard over the years in differing ways; (1913) First Nat. Bank of Louisville V.

Ct; Macey, J.R., O'Hara, M., The Corporate Governance of Banks, , April 2003 FRBNY ECONOMIC POLICY REVIEW 91 (arguing for a "broader, if not higher, standard of care" for bank directors.) The; Suggestion that bank directors owe a broader duty of care is meant to suggest that bank directors have fiduciary duties to depositors as well as to shareholders. The significance of this suggestion is that it would mediate between the interests of equityholders who would prefer a higher risk profile for the bank and the deposit-holders who would prefer a lower risk profile; Id. at 102. The classic articulation of directors' duties looks to the protection of shareholders' interests and only as an institution begins to approach insolvency does diat duty broaden to encompass debt-holders. For a detailed discussion of the potentially differing perspectives of protecting shareholder interests and debt-holder and depositor interests; McCoy, P.A., A political economy of the business judgment rule in banking: implications for corporate law (1996) Case W Res.

(2001) Banking LJ., 118, p. 493; 12 U.S.C. §1821(k). Although §1821(k) creates a federal standard of duty, as a legislative compromise it incorporates state law definitions of the relevant terms; 519 U.S. 213 (1997); Id. at 226; Id. at 227; Id; 519 U.S. at 224; Malloy, M.P., Banking Law and Regulation, , 3.46 n.l.

To approve the proposed settlemcnt the court was required to assess the strength of the claims asserted against the directors. The court concluded that there was a very low probability that upon a full trial in the action the directors would have been found to have breached their duty to monitor and supervise, based on the standard of sustained or systematic failure that the court determined was applicable; Id at 960; 911 A2d 362 (Del. 2006); Id at 365; Id. at 366; Id; (2006) Stone V. Ritter, , C.A. No. 1570-N, 2006 WL 302558, at *2 Del. Ch. Jan. 26; The Delaware rules require a plaintiff in a derivative action to allege with particularity the efforts made by the plaintiff to obtain action from the board or the reasons for not making the effort. Del. Ch. Ct. Rule 23.1 The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure contain a similar requirement for derivative actions. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.1. The Delaware Supreme Court has articulated various tests for determining when a stockholder demand upon a board will be excused as futile; (1984) Aronson V. Lewis, , 473 A2d 805 overruled on other grounds by Brehm v. Eisner, 746 A.2d 244 (2000); (1993) Rales V. Blasband, , 634 A2d 927 The "demand excused" test that the plaintiff in Stone sought to meet was that there was "a substantial likelihood of liability" for the directors arising from the claim. 911 A2d at 367; (2006) Stone V. Ritter, , 2006 WL 302558, at *2 Del. Ch. Jan. 26; Stone V. Ritter, , 911 A2d at 370; Id; Id The court noted, for example, that the Federal Reserve Board cease and desist order issued in connection with the deferred prosecution agreement was the first order issued by the Federal Reserve Board requiring AmSouth to improve its antimoney laundering and Bank Secrecy Act compliance program; id. at 366; Id at 373; Id. at 371. The court noted that according to the KPMG report, the components of AmSouth's compliance program exhibited between a low and high degree of compliance with applicable law and regulations; Id; Id. at 372 (quoting Caremark, 698 A.2d at 968); 924 A.2d 908 (Del. Ch. 2007); Id. at 935; Id Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law permits a corporation to include in its charter a provision eliminating liability for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty by a director, subject to certain exclusions. The charter provision will not eliminate or limit the liability of a director for: (i) a breach of the duty of loyalty; (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (iii) for willful or negligent violations of Delaware law provisions relating to unlawful dividends or stock redemptions; or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derives any improper personal benefit. The effect of such a charter provision is to eliminate monetary liability for a breach of the director's fiduciary duty of care, which is itself subject to a gross negligence standard; Aronson, 473 A.2d at 812 n.6. Some commentators had suggested that a free-standing duty of "good faith" existed under Delaware corporate law and that an "objective" standard of good faith would restore elements of liability otherwise eliminated by exculpatory charter provisions; Eisenberg, M.A., The duty of good faith in corporate law (2006) Dd. J. Corp. L, 31, p. 1. , 22-27 In its exegesis in Stone, the Delaware Supreme Court clarified that there is no free-standing duty of good faith, but instead that good faith is an element of the fiduciary duty of care and the fiduciary duty of loyalty. It further confirmed that oversight liability under the fiduciary duty of loyalty requires conduct that is qualitatively different from and more culpable than conduct giving rise to a violation of the fiduciary duty of care, i.e., gross negligence; 911 A.2d at 369; 192 F.R.D. 111 (S.D.N.Y. 2000); In re Cendant Corp., 189 F.R.D. 117,124-25 (D.N.J. 1999) (holding that demand was excused where the complaint alleged among other things that the accounting irregularities in question were so basic that they were discovered within one day after defendant corporation began its own investigation); Id at 117; (1999) The District Court Cited Miller V. Schreyer, , 683 N.Y.S.2d 51 App. Div. for this proposition. Miller involved a derivative claim against Merrill Lynch & Co. arising from an alleged "parking scheme" between Merrill and one of its corporate clients that occurred at each year-end for five successive years. The court said that in light of such factors as the magnitude and duration of the parking scheme, the matter should have come to the attention of the senior management and that the directors should have implemented oversight procedures to disclose "a patendy improper scheme extending over a five-year period." 683 N.Y.S. 2d at 55; 239 F.3d 808 (6th Cir. 2001), amended in part, 250 F.3d 997 (6th Cir. 2001); 239 F.3d at 816; note; Id at 824; Id at 819; 325 F.3d 795 (7th Cir. 2003).

abstract={A gap has emerged in the discussion of the current credit crisis. It relates to the role of corporate governance, and the board of directors in particular, in the risk management process. The existence of the gap may be explained in part by the quotidian nature of developments in the crisis, which have thus far required rapid reaction and left little time for careful retrospection. The gap will be closed as regulators and shareholders alike ficus renewed attention on the role of board supervision in the risk management processes. Regulators have traditionally set high expectations for the oversight role of the board. The complexities of large financial institutions have challenged those expectations. Shareholders too have expectations for the oversight of the board. Derivative actions will test the scope of those expectations.},

abstract={This study focuses on the composition of boards of directors in the Tunisian context. We model the composition of the board of directors as a function of alternative governance mechanisms, some board characteristics and other control variables. On a sample of 97 Tunisian firms, we find evidence that the proportion of outsiders on the board of directors is positively associated with large block, institutional and overseas ownerships, and board size. We document that the CEO duality is associated with a decrease in the board independence. We fail to find an evidence that increased debt ratio to total assets is inversely associated with the outside board representation. While we predict a positive relationship between the board independence and the firm size, the organizational complexity and the quotation status; our results generally do not support this conjecture.},

abstract={This paper highlights the importance of human resources in the
performance of Kosovo exporting SMEs. Due to its fragile past, Kosovo
has suffered greatly from both economic and human resources
underdevelopment. In the late 1990s, the European Union (EU) began to
promote trade liberalization in order to bring about regional
reconciliation in the Western Balkan region. SMEs in Kosovo need to
develop their competitiveness in order to increase their exports.
Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of human
resource characteristics such as the number of employees, education
level, and attendance of training related to exports on the level of
exports of 100 Kosovo SMEs. The Probit model is used to derive
statistical results. Statistical analysis is conducted based on
descriptive statistics, Reliability Test - Cronbach's Alpha-, Pseudo R2,
LR chi2, the Prob>chi2 and Wald test. It can be concluded that this
research will be of interest for the field of Human Resources Management
as well as the scientific community in developing countries such as
Kosovo. The main conclusion of the paper is that human resources of
Kosovo exporting SMEs do not have the necessary expertise and
contemporary knowledge regarding international trade.},

abstract={Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to examine the firm-level drivers of
competitiveness of the Czech small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
using the complex firm-level competitiveness index. The authors explored
the relationship between firm competitiveness and firm characteristics
such as size, age, industry affiliation and location.
Design/methodology/approach
The complex competitiveness index as a proxy for firm competitiveness
was calculated from the survey data. In total, 132 complete
questionnaires filled in by representatives of randomly selected Czech
SMEs were collected in 2018. Additional firm characteristics (size, age,
industry affiliation and location) considered as determinants of
competitiveness were obtained from the commercial database Albertina and
from the Czech Statistical Office. The determinants of competitiveness
were tested econometrically by estimation of multivariate regression
models.
Findings
The authors mainly found a significant relationship between the firm
size and competitiveness of the Czech SMEs. The authors have also
confirmed that the least competitive enterprises are those operating in
the agricultural sector and that regional location plays an important
role in the determination of firm competitiveness.
Practical implications
The identification of competitiveness drivers can provide entrepreneurs,
managers and policymakers with important implications. It seems
beneficial for the Czech SMEs to expand the scope of operations to
achieve a larger company size, for example, by focussing on investment
activities, direct marketing, improving entrepreneurial skills or by
applying an aggressive sales strategy, especially towards markets with
lower competition. Politicians may respond to these efforts by setting
the appropriate policies that promote SMEs' competitiveness, for
example, through the hard and soft public support for financial and
human resources.
Originality/value
Although many studies on competitiveness have been published, there is
still a limited number of firm-level studies looking at competitiveness
from multiple angles rather than from the study of profitability and
productivity. In contrast, the study uses a complex firm-level
competitiveness index based on ten competitiveness pillars (technology,
human capital, products, domestic market, networks, international
markets, online presence, marketing, decision making and strategy) to
capture the contribution of different resources and capabilities to firm
competitiveness.},

Design/methodology/approach The research is quantitative in nature, i.e.
it aims to explain the causality relationship between variables. This
research is quantitative research, it aims to explain the causality
relationship between variables. The analysis tool was generalized
structure component analysis. Findings First, government policy has a
significant and positive effect on workforce competitiveness, indicating
that higher government policy will result in higher workforce
competitiveness. Welding technology is the moderating variable in the
relationship between government policy and workforce competitiveness.
Higher implementation of welding technology will strengthen the
relationship between government policy and workforce competitiveness.
Second, quality of human resources has a significant and positive effect
on workforce competitiveness; higher quality of human resources will
therefore result in higher workforce competitiveness. Welding technology
is the moderating variable in the relationship between quality of human
resources and workforce competitiveness. Higher implementation of
welding technology will therefore strengthen the relationship between
quality of human resources and workforce competitiveness.
Originality/value The moderating effect of welding technology in the
relationships between government policy and quality of human resources
and workforce competitiveness has not been comprehensively studied yet;
the present study fills this gap.},

abstract={Purpose Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in
sustainable development. Indeed, national and international governments
call for urgent transformations into sustainable development, where
firms are affected and affecting this situation. However, recent
evidence has shown that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
present low interest, commitment and maturation levels on
sustainability; they seem to neglect and question the actual impact of
transforming sustainability as a priority in their operations. Thus,
this paper aims to measure the impact of sustainability on
competitiveness in SMEs. Design/methodology/approach This is empirical
research on sustainability and competitiveness in SMEs with a
quantitative approach through structural equation modeling. Three
hundred twenty-five surveys were applied to SMEs' manufacturing,
construction, trade and services, operating in Mexico. Before measuring
variables' multiple correlations, tests were carried out to establish
the validity and reliability of the model. The data collection,
validation and analysis were carried out with statistical package for
social sciences and analysis of moment structures. Findings The results
indicate a significant positive effect of SMEs' sustainability on
competitiveness. The adjusted measurement model shows validity and
reliability through the various tests applied. Thus, firms should not
view sustainability as detrimental to their competitiveness.
Originality/value Because firms are crucial in the urgent sustainability
transformation, recent research has shown their low commitment and
maturation to sustainability. This research's originality empirically
measures and demonstrates sustainability's impact on SMEs'
competitiveness. Therefore, empirically testing this impact becomes
essential and original to provide better insights into SMEs' needs to be
uncovered, prioritied and done in their specific and evolving contexts.},

abstract={While human capital remains the most important strategic asset for
ensuring business competitiveness and sustainability, what do we know
about human resource management in SMEs? This paper presents a
literature review on human resource management (HRM) in SMEs. The 167
empirical articles found by searching the ABI/Inform and Repere
databases are classified according to the nature of the knowledge they
generated. These articles are then sorted into Jive categories according
to whether they relate to (I) HR practices used in SMEs, (2) their
distinctive characteristics compared to large enterprises, (3) the
determinants of the adoption of HR practices, 4) their impact on the
performance of SMEs, and (5) the processes through which HR practices
are modified. The results show that the main focus of the studies was to
verify whether large enterprises HRM model applies to SMEs. The
formalization of HR practices has also attracted attention. In general,
few studies have been done on the various aspects of HRM and their
results are conflicting. Several research directions are proposed.},

abstract={Thanks to their dominant role in fostering socioeconomic prosperity,
exporting small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are perceived to be
a major societal asset. Coming out of the great financial crisis,
initiatives to nurture their (export) competitiveness have been high on
the political agenda. In this vein, a growing literature explores the
pertinence of firm-specific factors for explaining differences in SMEs'
export behavior. However, the puzzle of how intangible, knowledge-based
assets, such as human and relational capital, contribute to establishing
a viable position in export markets remains. By synthesizing empirical
evidence from 167 studies, this meta-analytic path analysis reveals
significant differential direct and indirect effects of human and
relational capital endowment on dimensions of export behavior.
Concurrently, our analysis uncovered that positive influences of
intangible assets are context-dependent. In fact, human resources appear
to be particularly pertinent for exporting SMEs in developing economies.},

abstract={Guided by a resource-based theory, this study is the first one that
takes a quantitative approach to identify determinants of
competitiveness of women-owned small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in
Vietnam. The study employs time series data of Vietnamese SMEs extracted
from the Vietnam Small and Medium Enterprises Survey conducted
biennially from 2005 to 2015 in ten Vietnamese provinces. Firm
competitiveness hereby is indicated by revenue, market share,
profitability, and export volume. The research reveals a number of
determining factors, of all, research and development, labor skills,
business environment, technology investment are the most important
factors, followed by capital and headcount. It is indicated that the
determining factors have different influences on competitiveness
obtained by different measurements. Therefore, it is based on specific
targets and situations to make wise business decisions. The authors also
make comparisons among groups of women-owned enterprises divided by
their firm age, location, ownership, export, age, and educational
background of business owners. The findings serve as critical empirical
evidence and provide policy recommendations for improving the
competitiveness of women-owned SMEs in Vietnam. The recommendations
range from technology support, education and professional support for
female entrepreneurs, access to capital and human resources to business
environment improvement.},

abstract={Purpose - This paper's aim is to evaluate the effect of the use of
information technology and communications (ITC) on the international
competitiveness of firms in developing countries. The study also seeks
to evaluate other factors that allow or condition the use of ITC such
as: human resources, collaboration of the industrial sector, and local
environment.
Design/methodology/approach - These effects are examined through an
empirical research of 100 small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from
a developing country Peru.
Findings - SMEs from developing countries follow an isomorphic approach.
This is because they tend to imitate or copy the better practices from
developed countries. The results have shown that ITCs have a positive
effect on the international competitiveness of firms.
Research limitations/implications - A limitation is the cross-sectional
character of this research.
Practical implications - Firms use ITC to manage their inventory, for
the communication between manufacturers and offices, and suppliers, for
bill payments, and for the management of sales and marketing, and for
the management of their networks.
Originality/value - According to the literature reviewed, this study is
one of the pioneers in contrasting empirically whether the use of ITC
contributes positively to the international competitiveness of firms in
the developing countries of Latin America.},

abstract={In recent years, open innovation (OI) has attracted much attention in
innovation management research. Although showing signs of advance, most
of the existing literature still relies, to a great extent, on case
studies and conceptual frameworks, with little empirical research in the
specific context of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This paper adds
to the literature by empirically assessing the effects of organizational
antecedents and innovation climate on OI as well as its consequences on
firm performance in SMEs. In addition, the moderating roles of
environmental dynamisms and competitiveness in the relationships between
innovation climate and inbound and outbound OI are analyzed. To achieve
these goals, this paper develops an integrative research model, which
analyses the network relations using covariance-based structural
equation modeling (SEM) on a data set of 429 Spanish SMEs. Results
revealed that organizational factors such as commitment-based human
resources practices have a positive influence on innovation climate and
that innovation climate contributes to both inbound and outbound OI.
Another important finding is that contingent factors such as
environmental dynamism strengthen the positive effect of innovation
climate on outbound OI. The main conclusions of this research can be
valuable to SMEs that implement or intend to implement OI. (C) 2017

abstract={Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are today considered a very
important pillar of economic growth in many countries. These companies
account for 80\% of global economic growth, employ the largest
percentage of the workforce and contribute to income generation.
However, although they represent a very important factor in today's
business these businesses face a number of challenges as they are
constantly under pressure to maintain their own competitiveness both in
the domestic and global markets. One of the key sources of survival of
small and medium enterprises and building a sustainable competitive
advantage are considered innovations. They usually start with innovative
ideas and innovative activities that lead to improvement in the overall
performance of the company. In addition to improving product quality and
reducing costs, innovation also allows for increased efficiency and
sales for the organization. Innovation is a process that must take place
continuously. The implementation of innovative culture in companies must
include all segments of the company and help to create good conditions
for the development of creative individuals.
Croatia is a country that belongs to the group of moderate innovators,
however, as innovation is today a key factor in the success of all
companies, this paper investigates the influence of human resources and
leadership on innovation in small and medium-sized companies in Croatia.},

abstract={The 21st century is the century of change and maybe one of the most
important changes in the organizations' life is the transition from
focusing on the development of the tangible assets to the development of
the intangible assets and the interest for attracting human resources
capable to generate performance. The survival of many companies depends
on their willingness and capacity to adapt to such changes. (Abdulaali,
2018) In this dynamic and complex economic system, the intangible assets
of organizations become primary, being decisive for the organizations'
performance. In the new economic competition, intangible assets provide
a sustainable competitive advantage, intellectual capital and intangible
assets representing the key factor in company profitability and success.
In the knowledge based society, intellectual capital has more value for
organizations than tangible assets and knowledge becomes a permanent
source of competitiveness (Bhatti, Zaheer, 2014). It is considered by
specialists a valuable and strategic resource, since the success of
organizations depends on creating, discovering, storing, disseminating,
measuring and developing knowledge. The main objective of the research
presented in this paper is to offer an overview on the specific problems
and needs of the entrepreneurs financed through the Romania Start-up
Plus programme, part of Start-UP Hub: The Entrepreneurs Laboratory Cod
SIMS: 105648. A primary target of this research is to examine the
components of intellectual capital and the way in which the intellectual
capital influences the small business performance. The majority of the
researchers agree that intellectual capital is directly connected to the
performance of the SMEs sector. The results of our analysis shows the
fact that intangible assets influence business development in various
ways, such as increasing competitive advantage, expanding employee
competency and improving organizational performance.},

abstract={The importance of business models for small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) in terms of their competitiveness and sustainability is
undoubtedly growing. The global Covid-19 pandemic even strengthens this
trend. The degree of digitalization of corporate processes becomes the
SME stability and development limitation. The paper submitted presents
the results of research focused on the issue of digital transformation
of business models on a test sample of 496 SMEs (out of which 214
operate in the manufacturing sector and industry and 218 are included in
the services sector) using the method of dimensionality reduction and
logit regression. The main output from the solution valid for both
tested sectors is considered insufficient setting, management and
evaluation of corporate processes. This applies to the main
value-creating processes (input and output logistics, production,
marketing and sales, service and other ancillary services) and
supporting processes (purchase, scientific and technological
development, human resources management and company infrastructure). In
terms of the achieved degree of process digitization, an imbalance was
found between the main value-creating processes and supporting
processes. Investment in value-creating and supporting corporate
processes are not considered an important factor for any of the sectors
due to the high sensitivity of investments to the size and
specialization of companies. In contrast, the higher perceived need for
value chain digitization in both tested sectors, especially in the case
of manufacturing and industry, is considered a very positive output.
This proves the need for the digital transformation of companies and its
positive impact on their profitability and competitiveness.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic and
updated assessment of studies on key exporting stimuli for small and
medium enterprises (SMEs) and to propose a research agenda on this
topic.
Design/methodology/approach - The authors develop a review of empirical
articles on SMEs' exporting stimuli and outline future research
directions based on key emerging drivers.
Findings - Research on SMEs' exporting drivers focuses mainly on human
resources' competences, skills and subjective characteristics and on the
role of relevant network actors (customers, intermediaries).
Originality/value - This paper provides an original contribution with
regard to updating the framework on export drivers by Leonidou et al.
(2007), highlighting an emerging research perspective based on
internal/external network dimensions and proposing future research
directions on internal individual and organisational actors and on new
external network actors.},

abstract={Developing talented human resources through learning entails nurturing
innovation and improving competitiveness; to achieve innovation,
tech-based SMEs within or around Korean technoparks must undertake
learning organisation activities (LOAs). Our results demonstrate that
six dimensions of the LOA model have more validity or a better model fit
than the previous seven dimensions of the LOA model. Furthermore, three
important sub-variables of LOAs (i.e., creating continuous learning
opportunities, establishing systems to capture and share learning and
providing strategic leadership for learning) have a positive and
significant effect on learning transfer. Finally, transferring LOAs was
found to mediate the relationship between LOAs and innovativeness by
creating continuous learning opportunities (and future directions) and
by providing strategic leadership for learning.},

abstract={Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have developed a marketing
capability that differs from the conventional one. Most of the
Literature has neglected marketing innovation, because it is considered
an accident or implicit in other types of activities, and only recently
it has been associated with competitiveness. The aim of this research
was to verify the relationship of marketing innovation with the integral
performance of SMEs, and their possible implications. Through the
structural equations modeling, the effects of this innovation on
business performance were estimated. The findings revealed its
significant influence to guide business performance, by implementing new
concepts and means of promotion, new methods of commercialization, and
modifications to its packaging, influencing mostly in the commercial
part, but also affecting the administrative, financial and human
resources scope.},

abstract={Using a multinomial logit model with the panel-data set of Vietnam
manufacturing firms, this paper investigates the impacts of foreign
direct investment (FDI) - small and medium enterprises (SMEs) linkages
and other factors on SMEs' participation in the global value chain
(GVC). We consider GVC firms are those engaging in any of the three
modes including (i) using domestic inputs to export (D2E), (ii) using
imported inputs to produce for the domestic market (I2P), (iii) using
imported inputs to export (I2E). We discover that FDI-SME linkages
statistically encourage Vietnamese SMEs to integrate into the GVC via
I2P and I2E, while no statistical association between FDI-SME linkage
and D2E participation is found. GVCs participation likelihood is also
positively correlated with the introduction of new product introduction.
The establishment of firms' production facilities in industrial zones
and foreign ownership are both reported to be significantly decisive
factors to SMEs' decisions on GVC participation. Besides, there is a
strong association between firms' attributes, i.e. employment, capital
intensity as well as financial access, and their participation in the
GVC. Local governance quality (proxied by the Provincial Competitiveness
Index) and the share of skilled labor at the province-level can
facilitate firms' integration into GVCs, while greater market
concentration may be a hurdle to such potential.},

abstract={Supply chain management as a new business philosophy in today's
competitive conditions is a source of numerous advantages for those
enterprises that apply it. Due to its dynamic structure, it is a much
wider term than that of logistics management, because it encompasses the
process of conceiving, developing, optimizing and managing internal and
external components of acquisition, transformation of material and
distribution of finished products or services in accordance with the
business strategic goals. The aim of the supply chain management is the
creation of as great a value as possible for all value chain
participants, especially for the final consumer, as he is at the end of
the system of value creation and he validates the quality of supply
chain via his purchase. When all enterprises-participants in the supply
chain - do their business separately and act on their own separate
business strategies, the sum of their expenses surpasses the expenses
generated by integrated business of these enterprises within the supply
chain. It is precisely because of this fact that, when an enterprise
creates a unique system of goods and information flow with other members
of the chain, it in fact enhances the efficiency of managing the entire
chain. In that way, the value of the whole system increases for the
consumer and competitive advantage of the chain is created. Since the
clusters occur by connecting enterprises or chains of new value
creation, the rest of this paper explains the meeting points between
cluster concept and supply chain concept respectively, with special
emphasis on agricultural clusters. The basic idea was that agricultural
clusters are a geographical concentration of mutually connected SMEs,
specialized suppliers and service providers, companies in related
businesses, scientific and educational institutions, and government
bodies and agencies in the sectors of agriculture and rural development.
Therefore, the network of interdependent enterprises (individual
agricultural farmsteads), within agricultural clusters and related
institutions, confirms that within every cluster there are numerous
supply chains, that is, that the supply chain management is an integral
part and an indispensable factor of a cluster. At the same time, there
is a complementarity and symbiosis between the concept of supply chain
management and cluster concept, that is, their combination can
effectively advance the competitive advantage both of the enterprises
(individual agricultural farmsteads) and consequently regional and
national economic competitiveness. The geographical proximity of cluster
participants enables a more efficient access to specialized resources,
information, human resources, institutions, and trainings; facilitates
the coordination of activities within enterprises (individual
agricultural farmsteads) as well as among cluster members; creates
larger possibilities for innovation; stimulates permanent comparison of
performances and of creating more successful business models, so-called
best practices; and contributes to the commercialization of products and
services and entering the new markets, as well as creating of new
enterprises (individual agricultural farmsteads). More specifically,
doing business in a cluster environment stimulates the competitiveness
of enterprises (individual agricultural farmsteads) and affects the
promotion of supply chain management within enterprises (individual
agricultural farmsteads).},

abstract={Family businesses are present in every economy, whether they are given
special attention or remain a general part of the strategic segment. In
Slovakia, despite the dominance of family businesses, not enough
attention is paid to them. The main objective of the paper is to
identify the key internal determinants that affect the management,
sustainability and development of Slovak family businesses. Current
information on the researched issue has been obtained through empirical
research in practice. The research was evaluated using statistical
hypothesis testing methods (Binomial test and Mann-Whitney U test).
While verifying the hypotheses, the statistical software STATISTICA 12,
was used. The results of the study led to conclusions that extend the
current knowledge in family businesses in Slovakia. The achieved results
showed that the key internal determinants influencing the development of
family businesses in Slovakia are: management, human resources, finances
and narrow specialization of the supply, especially on the Slovak
market.},

abstract={The aim of this paper is to analyze the main streams of literature
pertaining to HR systems development in start-ups or SME-se and to
identify the main approaches chosen by entrepreneurs and managers in the
early stages of the business development cycle. For the purpose of this
study, literature review has been conducted with particular focus on
high-quality journals with a proven influence in the HRM and Innovation
field. Concerning the research strategy, 23 papers published in Q1 and
Q2 ranked journals (SJR) were analyzed, as well as 6 other sources
inlcuding books, books proceedings and journals (not ranked in Scopus or
WoS databases). Our findings support the development of an integrated
approach that not only takes into account early investment into HR
systems, but also considers how macroeconomic factors might influence
the industry directly, and start-ups indirectly and incongruously. This
integrated perspective maintains that human capital acquisition and the
implementation of adequate HR policies and practices that support
employee engagement and retention early on are significantly more
beneficial to company performance and productivity in the longer run;
whereas, at the same time exhibiting a high degree of flexibility and
adaptability to business-and sector-specific preconditions and
requirements. We argue that future research should concentrate on the
industry as a factor determining the HR strategy to be adopted by
start-ups, as opposed to debating which approach is more appropriate for
start-ups without taking into account their operational environment.},
