Abstract = {Despite the significant benefits that the rise of Internet of Medical
   Things (IoMT) can bring into citizens' quality of life by enabling
   IoMT-based healthcare monitoring systems, there is an urgent need for
   novel security mechanisms to address the pressing security challenges of
   IoMT edge networks in an effective and efficient manner before they gain
   the trust of all involved stakeholders and reach their full potential in
   the market of next generation IoMT-based healthcare monitoring systems.
   In this context, blockchain technology has been foreseen by the industry
   and research community as a disruptive technology that can be integrated
   into novel security solutions for IoMT edge networks, as it can play a
   significant role in securing IoMT devices and resisting unauthorized
   access during data transmission (i.e., tamper-proof transmission of
   medical data). However, despite the fact that several blockchain-based
   security mechanisms have already been proposed in the literature for
   different types of IoT edge networks, there is a lack of
   blockchain-based security mechanisms for IoMT edge networks, and thus
   more effort is required to be put on the design and development of
   security mechanisms relying on blockchain technology for such networks.
   Towards this direction, the first step is the comprehensive
   understanding of the following two types of blockchain-based security
   mechanisms: (a) the very few existing ones specifically designed for
   IoMT edge networks, and (b) those designed for other types of IoT
   networks but could be possibly adopted in IoMT edge networks due to
   similar capabilities and technical characteristics. Therefore, in this
   paper, we review the state-of-the-art of the above two types of
   blockchain-based security mechanisms in order to provide a foundation
   for organizing research efforts towards the design and development of
   reliable blockchain-based countermeasures, addressing the pressing
   security challenges of IoMT edge networks in an effective and efficient
   manner.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is an important application of the
   Internet of Things (IoT) in the health field, including remote health
   monitoring and remote medical diagnosis. This not only brings
   convenience to the patient but also reduces the cost of the patient.
   However, the surge of data brought by mobile health monitoring equipment
   challenges the traditional centralized data processing model. In
   particular, medical data are closely related to patient privacy.
   Therefore, only part of the specific medical data should be provided to
   the medical institutions in need, rather than all the data, to ensure
   the confidentiality of the data to the greatest extent. But curious data
   processing centers can easily lead to data leakage. To tackle these
   challenges, we use edge computing and blockchain to build a new
   framework. In particular, the trusted execution environment, namely,
   software guard extension (SGX) technology, is introduced into edge
   computing to ensure the confidentiality of the data analysis process.
   The blockchain authenticates the IoMT devices and cloud service
   providers that are added to the network and provides an access policy
   management mechanism for IoMT data. Moreover, a prototype of the
   proposed framework is implemented using Hyperledger Fabric and Intel
   SGX, and the analysis of the blockchain and SGX performance are also
   presented.},

Abstract = {In the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic with no designated cure or
   vaccine, the only way to break the infection chain is self-isolation and
   maintaining the physical distancing. In this article, we present a
   potential application of the Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare and
   physical distance monitoring for pandemic situations. The proposed
   framework consists of three parts: a lightweight and low-cost IoT node,
   a smartphone application (app), and fog-based Machine Learning (ML)
   tools for data analysis and diagnosis. The IoT node tracks health
   parameters, including body temperature, cough rate, respiratory rate,
   and blood oxygen saturation, then updates the smartphone app to display
   the user health conditions. The app notifies the user to maintain a
   physical distance of 2 m (or 6 ft), which is a key factor in controlling
   virus spread. In addition, a Fuzzy Mamdani system (running at the fog
   server) considers the environmental risk and user health conditions to
   predict the risk of spreading infection in real time. The environmental
   risk conveys from the virtual zone concept and provides updated
   information for different places. Two scenarios are considered for the
   communication between the IoT node and fog server, 4G/5G/WiFi, or LoRa,
   which can be selected based on environmental constraints. The required
   energy usage and bandwidth (BW) are compared for various event
   scenarios. The COVID-SAFE framework can assist in minimizing the
   coronavirus exposure risk.},

Title = {Security Framework for IoT Based Real-Time Health Applications},

Abstract = {The amazing fusion of the internet of things (IoT) into traditional
   health monitoring systems has produced remarkable advances in the field
   of e-health. Different wireless body area network devices and sensors
   are providing real-time health monitoring services. As the number of IoT
   devices is rapidly booming, technological and security challenges are
   also rising day by day. The data generated from sensor-based devices
   need confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and end-to-end security
   for safe communication over the public network. IoT-based health
   monitoring systems work in a layered manner, comprising a perception
   layer, a network layer, and an application layer. Each layer has some
   security, and privacy concerns that need to be addressed accordingly. A
   lot of research has been conducted to resolve these security issues in
   different domains of IoT. Several frameworks for the security of
   IoT-based e-health systems have also been developed. This paper
   introduces a security framework for real-time health monitoring systems
   to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity by using two
   common IoT protocols, namely constrained application protocol (CoAP) and
   message query telemetry transports (MQTT). This security framework aims
   to defend sensor data against the security loopholes while it is
   continuously transmitting over the layers and uses hypertext transfer
   protocols (HTTPs) for this purpose. As a result, it shields from the
   breach with a very low ratio of risk. The methodology of this paper
   focuses on how the security framework of IoT-based real-time health
   systems is protected under the tiers of CoAP and HTTPs. CoAP works
   alongside HTTPs and is responsible for providing end-to-end security
   solutions.},

Title = {IoMT Platform for Pervasive Healthcare Data Aggregation, Processing, and
   Sharing Based on OneM2M and OpenEHR},

Abstract = {Pervasive healthcare services have undergone a great evolution in recent
   years. The technological development of communication networks,
   including the Internet, sensor networks, and M2M (Machine-to-Machine)
   have given rise to new architectures, applications, and standards
   related to addressing almost all current e-health challenges. Among the
   standards, the importance of OpenEHR has been recognized, since it
   enables the separation of medical semantics from data representation of
   electronic health records. However, it does not meet the requirements
   related to interoperability of e-health devices in M2M networks, or in
   the Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. Moreover, the lack of
   interoperability hampers the application of new data-processing
   techniques, such as data mining and online analytical processing, due to
   the heterogeneity of the data and the sources. This article proposes an
   Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform for pervasive healthcare that
   ensures interoperability, quality of the detection process, and
   scalability in an M2M-based architecture, and provides functionalities
   for the processing of high volumes of data, knowledge extraction, and
   common healthcare services. The platform uses the semantics described in
   OpenEHR for both data quality evaluation and standardization of
   healthcare data stored by the association of IoMT devices and
   observations defined in OpenEHR. Moreover, it enables the application of
   big data techniques and online analytic processing (OLAP) through Hadoop
   Map/Reduce and content-sharing through fast healthcare interoperability
   resource (FHIR) application programming interfaces (APIs).},

Title = {Energy harvesting IoT devices for sports person health monitoring},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 SEP 27},
Abstract = {Presently, the continuous monitoring of complex activities is valuable
   for understanding human health behavior and providing activity-aware
   services. At the same time, recognizing these health activities requires
   both movement and location information that can quickly drain batteries
   on wearable devices. The energizing factor in the wearable Internet of
   things (IoT) devices for Sports Person required prominent solutions in
   optimizing the performance and energy consumption of the health
   monitoring device of sports-person. Hence in this research, IoT assisted
   energy harvesting devices for sportspersons (IoT-EHDS) in health
   monitoring is the probabilistic system for harvesting energy in IoT
   devices for sports health monitoring. Energy harvesting is achieved in
   the IoT devices with the probabilistic framework (PF), which improves
   the accomplished interruption of the user to interact with versatile
   energy harvesting and frame demand procedure. The PF helps to smoothly
   prefetch the frames in accordance with contemporary user behavior from
   the end device. Parameters for sports-based devices are obtained using
   an energy harvesting method that is further graded and evaluated in
   terms of quantitative performance probability. Bayesian neural network
   (BNN) incorporates wearable device-based information to promote the
   health of sportsperson and to increase the quality of sports people's
   safety. BNN is used to classify sports person health activities. The
   experimental results show that the suggested system is validated by
   mHealth datasets, enhances the accuracy ratio of 96.42\%, and less
   consumption of energy to promote the energy harvesting IoT devices for
   sportspersons in healthcare.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is the next frontier in the
   digital revolution and it leverages IoT in the healthcare domain. The
   underlying technology has changed the current healthcare system by
   collecting real-time data of patients and providing a patient motioning
   system. But IoMT also presents a big challenge for data storage
   management, security, and privacy due to cloud-based storage. Today,
   this large volume of IoMT generated medical data is stored in the
   centralized storage system. However, centralization of patient sensitive
   information leads to a single point of failure, privacy, and security
   concern. To address these issues, we propose a smart contracts enabled
   consortium blockchain network. We integrated interplanetary file systems
   (IPFS) cluster node where smart contracts are deployed at the initial
   stage for authentication of patient's and medical devices, the same
   cluster layer is also proposed as a distributed data storage layer for
   device-generated data after authentication and these data are securely
   transmitted over the consortium blockchain. The IPFS cluster node
   ensures the security and authentication of the devices and it also
   provides secure storage management in IoMT enabled healthcare system.
   The consortium network enables the privacy of data owing to hash-based
   storage in a block of IoMT enabled healthcare network.},

Abstract = {With the onset of the Internet of Things (IoT) era, the number of IoT
   devices and sensors is increasing tremendously. This paper is concerned
   with a health IoT system consisting of various IoT devices carried by
   members of an environmental health community. We propose a novel
   trust-based decision making protocol that uses trust-based information
   sharing among the health IoT devices, so that a collective knowledge
   base can be built to rate the environment at a particular location and
   time. This knowledge would enable an IoT device acting on behalf of its
   user to decide whether or not it should visit this place/environment for
   health reasons. Unlike existing trust management protocols, our
   trust-based health IoT protocol considers risk classification,
   reliability trust, and loss of health probability as three design
   dimensions for decision making, resulting in a protocol suitable for
   decision making in health IoT systems. Our protocol is resilient to
   noisy sensing data provided by IoT devices either unintentionally or
   intentionally. We present performance data of our trust-based health IoT
   protocol and conduct a comparative performance analysis of our protocol
   with two baseline protocols to demonstrate the feasibility.},

Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT), leveraging interconnected sensors (i.e.,
   wireless body area network (WBAN), can offer opportunities for real time
   monitoring of patient health status and manage patients and treatment.
   Therefore, it is expected that IoT will play a significant role in the
   next-generation healthcare provisioning. Although IoT-based patient
   health status monitoring has become very popular, monitoring patients
   remotely outside of hospital settings requires augmenting the
   capabilities of IoT with other resources for health data storage and
   processing. In this paper, we propose an IoT-based service-oriented
   framework for continuous patient health status monitoring framework that
   connects WBAN through smartphones to cloud computing. We theoretically
   model the proposed framework, which is the first attempt in this
   direction, and study the behaviour of the proposed IoT-WBANs-based
   framework. Experimental evaluation based on the sensor lifetime,
   existing cost and energy consumption shows that the proposed framework
   substantially outperforms the baseline WBANs.},

Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is being adopted widely impacting every sphere
   around us. IoT enabled health-care is making the way ahead as it enables
   remote monitoring of health status seamlessly. The health-care industry
   historically has generated a large volume of data. With the induction of
   IoT, this volume has gone up drastically. Therefore, the health data is
   required to be stored properly to make sense of the data. In this paper,
   we propose cloudlet assisted IoT enabled e-Health framework. This
   e-Health framework aims to ease real-time data access using cloudlets.
   In this framework, we propose and implement a health-care data
   management scheme to store the enormous health data and process the
   queries for retrieval of the health data by end-users. We have used
   NoSQL based model to store health data. Performance of the proposed
   model has been studied in terms of data transmission time, energy
   consumption, query response time and data packet loss. Finally, by
   comparing the evaluation results of our proposed model with performances
   of the traditional cloud storage-based e-Health system, we justified
   that our proposed model is performing far better than existing
   cloud-based e-Health solutions.},

Abstract = {The concept of Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) is becoming popular
   nowadays and can he used in various smart city applications, e.g.,
   traffic management, healthcare, and surveillance. In the IoMT, the
   devices, e.g.. Multimedia Sensor Nodes (MSNs), are capable of generating
   both multimedia and non-multimedia data. The generated data are
   forwarded to a cloud server via a Base Station (BS). However, it is
   possible that the Internet connection between the BS and the cloud
   server may be temporarily down. The limited computational resources
   restrict the MSNs from holding the captured data for a longer time. In
   this situation, mobile sinks can be utilized to collect data from MSNs
   and upload to the cloud server. However, this data collection may create
   privacy issues, such as revealing identities and location information of
   MSNs. Therefore, there is a need to preserve the privacy of MSNs during
   mobile data collection. In this paper, we propose an efficient
   privacy-preserving-based data collection and analysis (P2DCA) framework
   for IoMT applications. The proposed framework partitions an underlying
   wireless multimedia sensor network into multiple clusters. Each cluster
   is represented by a Cluster Head (CH). The CHs are responsible to
   protect the privacy of member MSNs through data and location coordinates
   aggregation. Later, the aggregated multimedia data are analyzed on the
   cloud server using a counter-propagation artificial neural network to
   extract meaningful information through segmentation. Experimental
   results show that the proposed framework outperforms the existing
   privacy-preserving schemes, and can be used to collect multimedia data
   in various IoMT applications.},

Abstract = {Global health which denotes equitable access to healthcare, particularly
   in remote-rural-developing regions, is characterized by unique
   challenges of affordability, accessibility, and availability for which
   one of the most promising technological interventions that is emerging
   is the Internet of Things (IoT)-based remote health monitoring. We
   present an IoT-based smart edge system for remote health monitoring, in
   which wearable vital sensors transmit data into two novel software
   engines, namely rapid active summarization for effective prognosis
   (RASPRO) and criticality measure index (CMI) alerts, both of which we
   have implemented in the IoT smart edge. RASPRO transforms voluminous
   sensor data into clinically meaningful summaries called personalized
   health motifs (PHMs). The CMI alerts engine computes an aggregate
   criticality score. Our IoT smart edge employs a risk-stratified protocol
   consisting of rapid guaranteed push of alerts and PHMs directly to the
   physicians, and best effort pull of detailed data-on-demand through the
   cloud. We have carried out both clinical validation and performance
   evaluation of our smart edge system. The clinical validation on 183
   patients demonstrated that the IoT smart edge is highly effective in
   remote monitoring, advance warning and detection of cardiac conditions,
   as quantified by three measures, precision (0.87), recall (0.83), and
   F1-score (0.85). Furthermore, performance evaluation showed significant
   reductions in the bandwidth (98\%) and energy (90\%), thereby making it
   suitable for emerging narrow-band IoT networks. In the deployment of our
   system in the cardiology institute of our University hospital, we
   observed that our IoT smart edge helped to increase the availability of
   physicians by 59\%. Hence, our IoT smart edge system is a significant
   step toward addressing the requirements for global health.},

Abstract = {Trustworthy transmission is a beneficial step toward the success of the
   new era of telecommunication technologies and online social networks
   (OSNs). Many sensitive applications can benefit from OSNs, e.g., eHealth
   and medical services. However, OSNs have always been prey to Sybil
   attacks where numerous fake nodes are being generated and propagated in
   social networks to mimic like real nodes for the purpose of achieving
   malicious goals. Thus, for security reasons and for the sensitivity of
   data used in eHealth applications, such fake nodes have to be detected
   and deactivated immediately. The emerging field of the Internet of
   Medical Things (IoMT) promotes trust management (TM) among various IoMT
   devices to provide accurate and reliable communications, which is quite
   essential in critical diseases such as COVID-19. TM provides a secure
   platform to IoMT devices using different security protocols in the IoMT
   network. Generically, if a device is not comfortable to connect with
   additional devices in a network, the motive of the communication process
   is not succeeded and leads to disappointment for one device toward
   others. To handle these types of situations, a TM mechanism, named
   fuzzy-based TM mechanism for preventing Sybil attacks in the Internet of
   Medical Things (FTM-IoMT), is proposed. The FTM-IoMT provides TM for the
   users of eHealth systems using IoMT infrastructures. It is an
   intelligent mechanism to recognize Sybil or untrustworthy nodes in the
   system. The proposed mechanism helps IoMT nodes to collect authentic and
   credible information from their neighboring nodes as well as to neglect
   Sybil nodes. The trust value of a node is evaluated using fuzzy logic
   processing followed by the trust attributes, such as integrity,
   receptivity, and compatibility of a node. The FTM-IoMT provides a double
   evaluation check based on fuzzy logic processing and fuzzy filter. The
   proposed scheme shows superior results when compared to the
   state-of-the-art approaches.},

Abstract = {Cyber-attack detection via on-gadget embedded models and cloud systems
   are widely used for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The former
   has a limited computation ability, whereas the latter has a long
   detection time. Fog-based attack detection is alternatively used to
   overcome these problems. However, the current fog-based systems cannot
   handle the ever-increasing IoMT's big data. Moreover, they are not
   lightweight and are designed for network attack detection only. In this
   work, a hybrid (for host and network) lightweight system is proposed for
   early attack detection in the IoMT fog. In an adaptive online setting,
   six different incremental classifiers were implemented, namely a novel
   Weighted Hoeffding Tree Ensemble (WHTE), Incremental K-Nearest Neighbors
   (IKNN), Incremental Naive Bayes (INB), Hoeffding Tree Majority Class
   (HTMC), Hoeffding Tree Naive Bayes (HTNB), and Hoeffding Tree Naive
   Bayes Adaptive (HTNBA). The system was benchmarked with seven
   heterogeneous sensors and a NetFlow data infected with nine types of
   recent attack. The results showed that the proposed system worked well
   on the lightweight fog devices with \~{}100\% accuracy, a low detection
   time, and a low memory usage of less than 6 MiB. The single-criteria
   comparative analysis showed that the WHTE ensemble was more accurate and
   was less sensitive to the concept drift.},

Abstract = {Today, a wide range of developments and paradigms require the use of
   embedded systems characterized by restrictions on their computing
   capacity, consumption, cost, and network connection. The evolution of
   the Internet of Things (IoT) towards Industrial IoT (IIoT) or the
   Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT), its impact within the 4.0
   industry, the evolution of cloud computing towards edge or fog
   computing, also called near-sensor computing, or the increase in the use
   of embedded vision, are current examples of this trend. One of the most
   common methods of reducing energy consumption is the use of processor
   frequency scaling, based on a particular policy. The algorithms to
   define this policy are intended to obtain good responses to the
   workloads that occur in smarthphones. There has been no study that
   allows a correct definition of these algorithms for workloads such as
   those expected in the above scenarios. This paper presents a method to
   determine the operating parameters of the dynamic governor algorithm
   called Interactive, which offers significant improvements in power
   consumption, without reducing the performance of the application. These
   improvements depend on the load that the system has to support, so the
   results are evaluated against three different loads, from higher to
   lower, showing improvements ranging from 62\% to 26\%.},

Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) technology provides a competent and structured
   approach to handle service deliverance aspects of healthcare in terms of
   mobile health and remote patient monitoring. IoT generates an
   unprecedented amount of data that can be processed using cloud
   computing. But for realtime remote health monitoring applications, the
   delay caused by transferring data to the cloud and back to the
   application is unacceptable. Relative to this context, we proposed the
   remote patient health monitoring in smart homes by using the concept of
   fog computing at the smart gateway. The proposed model uses advanced
   techniques and services, such as embedded data mining, distributed
   storage, and notification services at the edge of the network. Event
   triggering-based data transmission methodology is adopted to process the
   patient's real-time data at fog layer. Temporal mining concept is used
   to analyze the events adversity by calculating the temporal health index
   of the patient. In order to determine the validity of the system, health
   data of 67 patients in IoT-based smart home environment was
   systematically generated for 30 days. Results depict that the proposed
   Bayesian belief network classifier-based model has high accuracy and
   response time in determining the state of an event when compared with
   other classification algorithms. Moreover, decision making based on
   real-time healthcare data further enhances the utility of the proposed
   system.},

Title = {Framework for Integration Decentralized and Untrusted Multi-Vendor IoMT
   Environments},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {108102-108112},
Abstract = {Lack of standardization is highly visible while we use historical data
   sets or compare our model with others that use IoMT devices from
   different vendors. The problem also concerns the trust in highly
   decentralized and anonymous environments where sensitive data are
   transferred through the Internet and then are analyzed by third-party
   companies. In our research we propose a standard that has been
   implemented in the form of framework that allows describing requirements
   for methods and platforms that collect, manage, share, and perform data
   analysis form the Internet of Medical Things in order to increase trust.
   Further, we can distinguish two types of IoMT devices: passive and
   active. Passive devices measure some parameters of the body and save
   them in databases. Active devices have the functionality of passive
   devices and moreover, they can act in a defined way, eg.: inject
   directly into the patient's body some elements such as a medicament,
   electric signals to the nervous system, stimulus pacemaker, etc.
   Nevertheless how to create a safe and transparent environment for using
   data active sensors, developing safe ML models, performing medical
   decisions based on the created models and finally deploy this decision
   to the specified device. While the IoMT devices are used in real-life,
   professional healthcare the control system should offer tools for
   backtracking decisions, allowing e.g. to find who made a mistake, or
   which event caused a particular decision. Our framework provides
   backtracking in the IoMT environment in which for each medical decision
   supported by ML models we can prove which sensor sends the data, which
   data was used to create prediction/recommendation, what prediction was
   produced, who and when use it, what medical decision was made by who. We
   propose a vendor transparency framework for each IoMT devices and ML
   models that will process the medical data in order to increase patient's
   privacy and prevent for eventual data leaking.},

Title = {SybilWatch: a novel approach to detect Sybil attack in IoT based smart
   health care},

Abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) in health care is gaining popularity in the
   field of research to improve quality in smart health care systems and
   applications. However, security and privacy of Smart Health (S-Health)
   data are the challenging issues due to Sybil attacks. Sybil attack is
   one of the most common attacks where a malicious node uses morphed
   identities to generate Sybil nodes. Sybil nodes can acquire an
   authorized node identity and misbehaves by affecting its routing
   information, incurs interruption on communication line and storage. One
   of the IoT based smart health methodology is Privacy-Aware Smart Health
   (PASH), in which policy hiding is used to protect the privacy of users.
   The major issues in PASH is expensive to implement in S-Health
   applications, also it does not deal with attribute revocation and node
   traceability. To addresses these issues, a novel SybilWatch Enhanced
   Privacy-Aware Smart Health (E-PASH) approach is proposed in this paper.
   This approach has three major phases such as initialization phase,
   secure communication and Sybil node detection. A Lightweight Encryption
   Algorithm (LEA) is used to transmit SHRs (Smart Health Record) in
   encrypted form using prime order grouping. A novel BlueTits Detection
   (BTD) algorithm is used in detection phase where cluster head gathers
   the recent activities of the suspicious user, and based on the gathered
   parameters (Master key and Last One-Time Authentication), the cluster
   head declares it as a Sybil node. As soon as Sybil node is detected,
   revised revocation list is shared with active users. The proposed
   approach is less expensive compared to the existing approach, it also
   supports attribute revocation and node traceability which are the major
   setbacks is PASH. Simulation results and comparison analysis shows that
   proposed SybilWatch is efficient and cost effective compared to the
   existing approach, the proposed approach yields high detection rate of
   99.7\% and also false positive rate is reduced to 1\% in the smart
   health systems, which is better compared to the existing approaches.},

Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2019},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices for patient
   monitoring has gained much attention in clinical care performance,
   proficient chronic disease management, and home caregiving. This work
   presents the design of efficient medical IoT sensor nodes (SNs) in terms
   of low-cost, low power-consumption, and increased data accuracy based on
   open-source platforms. The method utilizes a Sensor Controller (SC)
   within the IoT SN, which is capable of performing medical checks
   supporting a broad coverage of medical uses. A communication protocol
   has been developed for data and command exchange among SC, local
   gateways, and physicians' or patients' mobile devices (tablets, smart
   phones). The SC supports moving average window (MAW) and principle
   component analysis (PCA) filtering algorithms to capture data from the
   attached low-cost body sensors of different sampling profiles.
   Significant extensions in SN's portability is achieved through energy
   consumption minimization based on the idle time gaps between sensors'
   activations. SN's components are either deactivated or set to low
   activity operation during these idle intervals. A medical case study is
   presented and the evaluated results show that the proposed SN can be
   incorporated into e-health platforms since it achieves comparable
   accuracy to its certified and high-cost commercial counterparts.},

Abstract = {These days, the usage of machine-learning-enabled dynamic Internet of
   Medical Things (IoMT) systems with multiple technologies for digital
   healthcare applications has been growing progressively in practice.
   Machine learning plays a vital role in the IoMT system to balance the
   load between delay and energy. However, the traditional learning models
   fraud on the data in the distributed IoMT system for healthcare
   applications are still a critical research problem in practice. The
   study devises a federated learning-based blockchain-enabled task
   scheduling (FL-BETS) framework with different dynamic heuristics. The
   study considers the different healthcare applications that have both
   hard constraint (e.g., deadline) and resource energy consumption (e.g.,
   soft constraint) during execution on the distributed fog and cloud
   nodes. The goal of FL-BETS is to identify and ensure the privacy
   preservation and fraud of data at various levels, such as local fog
   nodes and remote clouds, with minimum energy consumption and delay, and
   to satisfy the deadlines of healthcare workloads. The study introduces
   the mathematical model. In the performance evaluation, FL-BETS
   outperforms all existing machine learning and blockchain mechanisms in
   fraud analysis, data validation, energy and delay constraints for
   healthcare applications.},

Title = {Predicting Neurological Disorders Linked to Oral Cavity Manifestations
   Using an IoMT-Based Optimized Neural Networks},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {190722-190733},
Abstract = {Anatomically, oral cavity and central nervous system have a close
   relationship; the mouth and face are the location for 30-40 of the
   body's sensory and motor nerves. The identification of orofacial
   manifestations of neurological disorders is usually in direct relation
   with the responsibilities of a dental surgeon. Therefore, familiarizing
   dental surgeons with theses manifestations is essential to have better
   recognition, diagnosis, and correct decisions upon treating their
   associated Neurological Disorders. These manifestations should be
   efficiently analyzed using novel effective techniques since their
   related neurological disorders need to be early identified to avoid
   serious consequences. Furthermore, preventive dental care for patients
   with neurological disorders and all kind of rehabilitative treatments
   necessitates well-planned and effective novel approaches. The Internet
   of Medical Thing (IoMT) is a relatively new technology that allows the
   transfer of medical data over a secure network of medical sensors and
   wearable devices. The data transferred are of utmost importance in
   diseases diagnosis and treatment. In this paper, an IoMT-based
   Intelligent Guided Particle Local Search with Optimized Neural Networks
   (IGPLONN) approach is proposed. Firstly, dental data are collected from
   the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR) oral cavity
   and central nervous system. Secondly, features are extracted from data
   and IGPLONN algorithm is utilized to select the effective features by
   minimizing the feature dimension that helps improve the overall
   prediction rate. Finally, the obtained features are transferred to the
   central health application through the IoMT platform where they can be
   analyzed by dental practitioners for neurological disorders prediction.
   The hybrid optimized technique improves the overall oral-linked
   neurological diseases detection rate. Moreover, it efficiently manages
   the forecast parameters that are used to predict the dental metastasis
   with minimum computational complexity. The performance of the proposed
   system has been experimentally evaluated on MATLAB to verify its
   excellence. The results revealed that proposed IoMT-based IGPLONN method
   attains the maximum accuracy of 98.3\% compared to other methods.},

Abstract = {An Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) architecture aims to provide a
   support for real-time multimedia applications by using wireless
   multimedia sensor nodes that are deployed for a long-term usage. These
   nodes are capable of capturing both multimedia and nonmultimedia data,
   and form a network known as Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network (WMSN).
   In a WMSN, underlying routing protocols need to provide an acceptable
   level of Quality of Service (QoS) support for multimedia traffic. In
   this paper, we propose a Seamless and Authorized Streaming (SAMS)
   framework for a cluster-based hierarchical WMSN. The SAMS uses
   authentication at different levels to form secured clusters. The
   formation of these clusters allows only legitimate nodes to transmit
   captured data to their Cluster Heads (CHs). Each node senses the
   environment, stores captured data in its buffer, and waits for its turn
   to transmit to its CH. This waiting may result in an excessive
   packet-loss and end-to-end delay for multimedia traffic. To address
   these issues, a channel allocation approach is proposed for an
   intercluster communication. In the case of a buffer overflow, a member
   node in one cluster switches to a neighboring CH provided that the
   latter has an available channel for allocation. The experimental results
   show that the SAMS provides an acceptable level of QoS and enhances
   security of an underlying network.},

Abstract = {A digital-twin (DT)-enabled Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) system for
   telemedical simulation is developed, systematically integrated with
   mixed reality (MR), 5G cloud computing, and a generative adversarial
   network (GAN) to achieve remote lung cancer implementation.
   Patient-specific data from 90 lung cancer with pulmonary embolism
   (PE)-positive patients, with 1372 lung cancer control groups, were
   gathered from Qujing and Dehong, and then transmitted and preprocessed
   using 5G. A novel robust auxiliary classifier GAN (rAC-GAN)-based
   intelligent network is employed to facilitate lung cancer with the PE
   prediction model. To improve the accuracy and immersion during remote
   surgical implementation, a real-time operating room perspective from the
   perception layer with a surgical navigation image is projected to the
   surgeon's helmet in the application layer using the DT-based MR guide
   clue with 5G. The accuracies of the area under the curve (AUC) of our
   new intelligent IoMT system were 0.92 and 0.93. Furthermore, the
   pathogenic features learned from our rAC-GAN model are highly consistent
   with the statistical epidemiological results. The proposed intelligent
   IoMT system generates significant performance improvement to process
   substantial clinical data at cloud centers and shows a novel framework
   for remote medical data transfer and deep learning analytics for
   DT-based surgical implementation.},

Abstract = {One rapidly growing application of Internet of Things (IoT) is the
   protection of public health and well-being through enabling
   environmental monitoring services. In particular, an IoT-enabled
   health/accessibility monitoring service can be consulted by its users to
   query about the status of different areas so as to optimize their trip
   throughout a geographic region. Given the high cost associated with a
   vast deployment of totally trusted information sources, the IoT-enabled
   monitoring services also subsist on citizen engagement and on (possibly
   untrusted) users sensing apparatus for data collection. However, trust
   management becomes a key factor in the success of such services because
   they might be misled by malicious users through altered or fake sensor
   data. In this paper, we consider a monitoring service and propose a
   hybrid entity/data trust computation scheme which relies on Bayesian
   learning to score the users (as data reporters), and on Dempster-Shafer
   theory (DST) for data fusion and for the computation of the
   trustworthiness of the data itself. In order to provide resiliency
   against behavioral changes, the probability masses used in DST are
   dynamically updated using the freshly estimated user scores as well as
   the contextual properties associated with the reported data. We conduct
   simulation experiments to evaluate the performance of our scheme.
   Compared to prior work, the results demonstrate superior performance in
   terms of accuracy and resilience against malicious behavior.},

Abstract = {Pervasive healthcare services have evolved substantially in the recent
   years with IoMT rapidly changing the pace and scale of healthcare
   delivery. A promising application of IoMT is to fetch patterns of mental
   behaviour symptomatology based on bio-signals and transfer it to the
   corresponding hospital or psychologist for remote monitoring. But the
   data volume \& performance, device diversity \& interoperability,
   hacking \& unauthorized use and acceptance \& adoption barriers still
   restrain the practical and competent use of these devices. This research
   presents a plausible solution to surmount the data overload and
   processing latency in real-time sensory data collected through wearable
   devices for mental health monitoring. We propose a modified k-medoid
   data clustering technique based on time-frame restricted intra-cluster
   similarity calculations to obtain a summarized version of the original
   benchmark WESAD dataset for which the degree of information lost is
   minimum. A CNN is then trained on this summarized dataset for
   classification of mental state into the baseline, stress and amusement
   categories. The results show a significant reduction in the average
   execution time by 34\% with a comparable accuracy to the original
   dataset, thus offering prompt real-time healthcare analytics.},

Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) played a significant role in Healthcare. One of
   the major challenges in IoT health is security. For this reason,
   regarding the past studies, there is a lack of a comprehensive security
   framework that encompasses all layers of IoT. This article offers a
   security framework with four layers of sensor, network, service, and
   application. These layers help to develop security mechanisms within the
   proposed framework by providing security solutions. Also, security
   improvement has been influenced by the Multi Criteria Decision Making
   (MCDM) technique. To evaluate this framework, a conceptual model was
   defined with six critical criteria including security, network,
   services, interoperability, privacy, and reliability. The validity and
   reliability of this conceptual model were analyzed using SPSS 24 and
   AMOS 18. After proving the important criteria in the proposed model, we
   used the MCDM process of fuzzy analytic network process to prioritize
   the important criteria. The evaluation results of the conceptual model
   in the proposed framework, after analyzing the routes, show the validity
   of the proposed criteria. Therefore, in this model, 8 out of 12
   communication routes between the criteria have a positive and
   significant relationship and 4 routes do not. The results of
   prioritizing important criteria in the research model, using analytic
   network process method, show that the network criterion, and
   authentication and validation sub-criteria have the highest priority
   among the proposed criteria. Thus, it can be decided that security
   solutions in the network layer and authentication and validation
   sub-criteria help to develop the proposed security framework.},

Abstract = {Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based bridge structural health monitoring
   (BSHM) has recently attracted considerable attention from both academic
   and industrial communities of civil engineering and computer science. In
   conjunction with researchers from civil engineering and computer
   science, this article studied a fundamental problem motivated from
   practical IoT-based BSHM: how to effectively prolong network lifetime
   while guaranteeing desired coverage. Integrating a promising
   reinforcement learning model named learning automata (LA) with confident
   information coverage (CIC) model, this article presented an
   energy-efficient sensor scheduling strategy for partial CIC coverage in
   IoT-based BSHM system to guarantee network coverage and prolong network
   lifetime. The proposed scheme fully exploits cooperation among deployed
   nodes and alternatively schedules the wake/sleep status of nodes while
   satisfying network connectivity and partial coverage ratio. Especially,
   the proposed scheme takes full advantage of the LA model to adaptively
   learn the optimal sensor scheduling strategy and significantly extend
   network lifetime. A series of comparison simulations using real data
   sets collected by a practical BSHM system strongly verify the
   effectiveness and energy efficiency of the proposed algorithm. To the
   best of our knowledge, this is the first study on how to combine the
   reinforcement learning mechanism with partial coverage for maximizing
   the network lifetime of the IoT-based BSHM.},

Abstract = {In this work, we propose and develop healthcare device interoperability
   (HeDI)-a system to enable device interoperability in IoT-enabled in-home
   healthcare monitoring platforms. The system consists of multiple
   sensors, each connected wirelessly to an edge device, acting as a
   wireless communication gateway to a remote server. The system initiates
   information handshaking between the sensor adapters and edge device at
   the beginning of the operation, which is later used to detect the sensor
   settings to process the data received from the sensor. The system is
   scalable and dynamically accommodates multiple sensors without any
   predefined ontologies at the edge device. The implementation of our
   system avoids dependencies on a system's physical ports. The low form
   factor and wireless connectivity of the adapter make the system portable
   and convenient for in-home health monitoring. Additionally, the system
   allows multiple homogeneous sensors to operate at the same time in the
   same system. We implement and evaluate our system with a 3-lead ECG,
   pulse, and temperature sensors against two different network
   configurations-star and mesh. We use the data set generated from our
   implemented system for performance analysis. The network-level analysis
   of our system shows an average packet delivery ratio of 0.92 for star
   network configuration and 0.98 for mesh network configuration, ensuring
   the reliability of performance and its suitability for healthcare
   monitoring systems.},

Title = {An Integrated Framework for Health State Monitoring in a Smart Factory
   Employing IoT and Big Data Techniques},

Abstract = {With the rapid growth in the use of various smart digital sensors, the
   Internet of Things (IoT) is a swiftly growing technology, which has
   contributed significantly to Industry 4.0 and the promotion of IoT-based
   smart factories, which gives rise to the new challenges of big data
   analytics and the implementation of machine learning techniques. This
   article proposes a practical framework that combines IoT techniques, a
   data lake, data analysis, and cloud computing for manufacturing
   equipment health-state monitoring and diagnostics in smart
   manufacturing. It addresses all the required aspects in the realization
   of such a system and allows the seamless interchange of data and
   functionality. Due to the specific characteristics of IoT sensor data
   (low quality, redundant multisources, partial labeling), we not only
   provide a promising framework but also give detailed insights and pay
   considerable attention to data quality issues. In the proposed
   framework, an ingestion procedure is designed to manage data collection,
   data security, data transformation and data storage issues. To improve
   the quality of IoT big data, a high-noise feature filter is proposed for
   automated preliminary sensor selection to suppress noisy features,
   followed by a noisy data cleaning module to provide good quality data
   for unbiased diagnosis modeling. The proposed framework can achieve
   seamless integration between IoT big data ingestion from the physical
   factory and machine learning-based data analytics in the virtual
   systems. It is built on top of the Apache Spark processing engine, being
   capable of working in both big data and real-time environments. One case
   study has been conducted based on a four-stage syngas compressor from
   real industries, which won the Best Industry Application of IoT at the
   BigInsights Data \& AI Innovation Awards. The experimental results
   demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed IoT-architecture and
   techniques to address the data quality issues.},

Abstract = {The dental disease is a common disease for a human. Screening and visual
   diagnosis that are currently performed in clinics possibly cost a lot in
   various manners. Along with the progress of the Internet of Things (IoT)
   and artificial intelligence, the internet-based intelligent system have
   shown great potential in applying home-based healthcare. Therefore, a
   smart dental health-IoT system based on intelligent hardware, deep
   learning, and mobile terminal is proposed in this paper, aiming at
   exploring the feasibility of its application on in-home dental
   healthcare. Moreover, a smart dental device is designed and developed in
   this study to perform the image acquisition of teeth. Based on the data
   set of 12 600 clinical images collected by the proposed device from 10
   private dental clinics, an automatic diagnosis model trained by MASK
   R-CNN is developed for the detection and classification of 7 different
   dental diseases including decayed tooth, dental plaque, uorosis, and
   periodontal disease, with the diagnosis accuracy of them reaching up to
   90\%, along with high sensitivity and high specificity. Following the
   one-month test in ten clinics, compared with that last month when the
   platform was not used, the mean diagnosis time reduces by 37.5\% for
   each patient, helping explain the increase in the number of treated
   patients by 18.4\%. Furthermore, application software (APPs) on mobile
   terminal for client side and for dentist side are implemented to provide
   service of pre-examination, consultation, appointment, and evaluation.},

Title = {IoMT: Rinku's Clinical Kit Applied to Collect Information Related to

Abstract = {COVID-19 healthcare professionals recommend the general population
   staying at home and remote contacting the authorities, e.g. via SMS
   messages, if they show symptoms like cough, body pain, fever, and
   breathing difficulties. Although this approach considers the patient
   self-report, it is not supported by physiological data, i.e. medical
   personnel does not have a remote mechanism to validate such symptoms.
   This paper proposes a system, called Rinku, to address the
   abovementioned scenario. Rinku integrates an electronic system
   (ClinicalKit) comprising biomedical sensors for body temperature, pulse
   rate, and oxygen saturation, as well as a digital platform for storing
   and displaying the collected data. Rinku system aims to provide health
   professionals with relevant information to remotely validate COVID-19
   symptoms. Rinku can handle simultaneous information from multiple
   patients and provide valuable data related to the severity of the
   reported symptoms, which in turn could help healthcare professionals to
   make management decisions to optimize their clinical resources. In this
   paper, the functionality of the ClinicalKit, communication between the
   IoT architecture and the cloud, and the monitoring of physiological
   parameters were tested. The results showed that the enclosure design is
   convenient, IoT architecture is functional and the tracking of
   temperature, heart rate, and blood oxygen levels from subjects is
   promising. We consider that the Rinku system has the potential to
   provide an accurate forecast regarding the demand for clinical resources
   and take prompt actions related to this pandemic.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a pervasive system that
   continuously demonstrates an expanded application in various domains.
   The energy-efficiency problem has always been a crucial issue linked to
   this type of network where the system lifetime strongly depends on
   devices' batteries. Numerous energy-efficient networking protocols have
   been proposed in the literature to increase the system lifetime.
   However, most of the proposed approaches deal with the short-term vision
   of energy consumption and omit to consider the rechargeable battery
   degradation when evaluating the network lifetime. Indeed, the major
   parts of the network devices use rechargeable batteries that age and
   degrade over time due to several factors (temperature, voltage,
   charging/discharging cycle, etc.). Therefore, it is essential to
   promptly detect these internal and environmental degradation factors to
   avoid network failures. Clustering represents one of the main wireless
   network protocols and plays an essential role in network self
   organizing. In this work, we propose a novel long-term energy
   optimization clustering approach based on battery State of Health (SoH)
   prediction, called LECA\_SOH. The objective is to predict the impact of
   cluster heads election on the rechargeable batteries SoH before applying
   the clustering. LECA\_SOH fosters the selection of the nodes, which will
   less suffer from battery degradation during the future rounds, leading
   to extend the system lifetime. The obtained results demonstrate that the
   proposed clustering approach improves the network lifetime in the long
   term and extends the number of recharging cycles compared to the
   conventional energy-efficient approaches.},
