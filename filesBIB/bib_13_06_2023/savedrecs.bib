Abstract = {Facing the challenges of programming courses teaching in university,
   this study constructs a precision teaching classroom for programming
   courses that integrates precision teaching theory. Firstly, this paper
   analyzes the realization conditions for precision teaching in
   programming courses, then designs the implementation process of
   precision teaching including three teaching phases and five teaching
   links, and finally carried out teaching practice in C Language
   Programming course. The practice results showed that in the precision
   programming teaching classroom, teacher-student interactions were more
   frequent and students had higher programming learning efficiency than in
   ordinary programming teaching classroom. Compared with the control
   class, students in the experimental class were more capable of grasping
   programming knowledge and had better programming problem-solving
   abilities, and most of them were highly satisfied with teaching design
   of precision teaching classroom for C Language Programming. Precision
   programming teaching classroom constructed by this research provides a
   more optimized and effective teaching method for university programming
   teaching. On the other hand, this study provides a practical case for
   the integration and application of precision teaching theory and
   university curriculum teaching.},

Abstract = {Teachers and students often consider learning programming a difficult
   pursuit. Face-to-face learning alone cannot provide effective teaching
   or efficient solutions for learning. A case teaching model can make
   students active in programming courses, even as it relies on solid
   learning theory and pedagogical strategies. This paper reports a study
   based on a case teaching model in C/C++ programming. The Laboratory
   Animal System (LAS) is a standalone case for management of laboratory
   animals. This paper includes an overview of LAS architectural design and
   user interface by C/C++ and presents the design, implementation, and
   evaluation of the model, as well as its implications for learning
   computer programming. The case method provides an interactive learning
   environment for students. Based on a survey of student feedback,
   students can learn C/C++ programming and gain knowledge more quickly and
   effectively using the case teaching model than through some traditional
   methods of teaching. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   project-based (PBL) professional learning program in Denmark using a
   mixed-method research. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the
   participants' teaching and learning portfolios, which each included six

   teacher-centered domination at the program's start to more
   learner-centered beliefs by the end (Nine teachers held learner-centered
   beliefs, seventeen teachers held dual beliefs and nine teachers still
   held teacher-centered beliefs.). Survey analysis identified a
   significant change in participants' intended practices at the end of the
   program. Participants reported a significant increase in using classroom
   interactions and formative assessment and a significant decrease in
   using summative assessment, yet content delivery remained the focus of
   their practices. A significant correlation was identified between
   participants' beliefs and practices at the program's end, which was not
   found at the program's start. The results indicate a noteworthy impact
   of the PBL-based professional learning program on the participants'
   changes in beliefs and practices, and an association between beliefs and
   practices was found. However, systemic, individual and cultural factors
   may constrain changes in teaching practices.},

Abstract = {Aim: An experimental teaching and learning program used in biochemistry
   and molecular biology with first-year students in the second term in the
   Faculty of Biological Sciences at Huanghuai University, China.
   Materials: Sixty students were divided randomly into two sections (n =
   30 per section). Students in one section were divided randomly into five
   groups (six students in each group) and taught using a hybrid
   collaborative learning and lecture method (experimental section). The
   second section was taught using a tradition\& teaching method (control
   section). To assess achievement, examinations were carried out at the
   end of every textbook chapter and a final examination in biochemistry
   and molecular biology was administered at the end of the course. To
   determine students' attitude to the teaching methods used, a
   questionnaire survey was conducted at the end of the term. Results:
   Results showed that students preferred the experimental method. In the
   experimental section, students' scores were significantly higher than
   those of students in the control section both in the chapter and the
   final examinations (p < 0.05). Results indicate that the collaborative
   learning- and quiz-based teaching and learning style is superior to the
   traditional method of teaching and learning biochemistry and molecular
   biology.},

Title = {Development and implementation of a longitudinal students as teachers
   program: participant satisfaction and implications for medical student
   teaching and learning},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {JAN 31},
Abstract = {Background: Teaching is a key component of medical practice, but medical
   students receive little formal training to develop their teaching
   skills. A longitudinal Students as Teachers (SAT) program was created at
   the University of Toronto to provide medical students with opportunities
   to acquire an understanding of educational pedagogy and practice
   teaching early in their medical training. This program was 7-months in
   duration and consisted of monthly educational modules, practical
   teaching sessions, feedback, and reflective exercises.
   Methods: A mixed methods study design was used to evaluate initial
   outcomes of the SAT program by obtaining the perspectives of 18
   second-year medical students. Participants filled out questionnaires at
   the beginning and end of the 7-month program to indicate their skill
   level and confidence in teaching. Differences between pre- and
   post-intervention scores were further explored in a group interview of 5
   participants.
   Results: Participants expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the
   SAT program structure and found the educational modules and practical
   teaching sessions to be particularly beneficial to their learning. Over
   the course of the program, there were significant increases in students'
   confidence in teaching, and self-perceived teaching capacity and
   communication skills. Furthermore, participants discussed improvements
   in their effectiveness as learners.
   Conclusions: Teaching is a skill that requires ongoing practice. Our
   results suggest that a longitudinal program consisting of theoretical
   modules, practical teaching sessions, feedback, and reflective exercises
   for medical students may improve teaching and communication skills, and
   equip them with improved learning strategies. This program also provides
   students with insight into the experience of teaching while holding
   other academic and clinical responsibilities.},

Abstract = {The College of Science and Health Professions offers a university
   preprofessional program. Like most medical schools in Saudi Arabia, the
   teaching delivery strategy in the university preprofessional program is
   on campus and face-to-face. During the month of March 2020, teaching
   activities of the spring semester were proceeding as normal; however,
   the sudden emergence of COVID-19 disturbed routine activities and
   compelled authorities to switch all teaching activities from
   face-to-face to online. Training sessions and workshops for all
   stakeholders on online delivery methods were arranged. Blackboard and
   other online facilities were utilized. All teaching materials, including
   newly made video clips for anatomy and physiology practicals, were
   uploaded on Blackboard and discussed online with students. Students'
   anxiety related to the exam was reassured by giving them the option of
   open book quizzes during summative continuous assessment. All scheduled
   teaching sessions, lectures, and practicals were conducted proficiently.
   Revision sessions and assessment quizzes were conducted with students'
   satisfaction. At the end of the semester, a final exam was conducted
   online as an open book exam. Students with technical issues while
   attempting the exam were given an opportunity to make up for it. After a
   successful final exam, the cumulative block grades showed students
   secured higher grades in the open book exam. Following that, the King
   Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences has managed to conduct
   on-campus close book exams that abide by self-distancing and standard
   operating procedure policies.},

Abstract = {Objective. To determine the perceived value that pharmacy practice
   department chairs ascribe to pharmacy faculty candidates having
   completed a teaching and learning curriculum (TLC) program and related
   activities.
   Methods. An 18-item survey instrument was created that was intended to
   capture the overall impressions of pharmacy practice chairs regarding
   the value of TLC programs, relative importance compared to other
   accomplishments (eg, residency completion, board certification), and
   importance of specific activities. Following pilot testing and
   establishment of intra-rater reliability, invitations to complete the
   electronic survey instrument were sent to pharmacy practice chairs (or
   their equivalent) at accredited Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) programs in
   the United States.
   Results. Of the 127 pharmacy practice chairs invited, 53 completed the
   survey (response rate of 41.7\%). The majority of respondents held a
   PharmD degree (90.6\%), had been in their role of chair for zero to five
   years (60.4\%), and represented a private institution (54.7\%). The
   majority of respondents who answered the question (32 of 49) felt it was
   very important or important (16.3\% and 49.0\%, respectively) that
   teaching experiences be completed within a formal teaching and learning
   curriculum program. These programs were believed to be most important
   for candidates with less than five years of professional experience.
   Teaching and learning curriculum programs were not deemed to be more
   important than other accomplishments by most responders. The perceived
   most important TLC program activities were instruction on didactic and
   experiential teaching strategies, and experience developing learning
   objectives, developing examination items, evaluating examination
   results, and facilitating case conferences or practice laboratory
   activities.
   Conclusion. Teaching and learning curriculum programs may provide the
   foundational experiences needed for pharmacy graduates to stand out
   among other candidates, although department chairs' perceptions of the
   value of teaching and learning curriculum experiences varied.},

Abstract = {Contribution: This article presents the instruction of computer
   programming using adaptive learning activities considering students'
   cognitive skills based on the learning theory of the Revised Bloom
   Taxonomy (RBT). To achieve this, the system converts students' knowledge
   level to fuzzy weights, and using rule-based decision making, delivers
   adequate learning activities regarding their kind and complexity degree.
   Background: Tutoring through adaptive learning activities can be a
   powerful tool to support learners in practical courses, like computer
   programming. However, published results from pertinent literature are
   not oriented to the adaptivity of the domain knowledge in terms of the
   volume, kind, and complexity of the learning activities delivered to
   students. There is scope for a lot of improvement to this direction.
   Intended Outcomes: Combining learning theories with adaptive tutoring
   enhances student-centered learning, promotes student engagement, and
   improves knowledge acquisition. Application Design: An adaptive tutoring
   system was developed for supporting undergraduate students in the C\#
   programming language course for an academic semester. The system
   delivers adaptive learning activities to students' cognitive skills
   using the technology of fuzzy weights in a rule-based decision-making
   module and the learning theory of a RBT for designing the learning
   material. Findings: At the end of the academic semester, students' data
   have been collected and a detailed evaluation was conducted. The results
   showed that the presented approach outperforms others which lack
   adaptivity in domain knowledge and learning theories, improving
   significantly the students' learning outcomes.},

Abstract = {Computer programming tools for young children are being created and used
   in early childhood classrooms more than ever. However, little is known
   about the relationship between a teacher's unique instructional style
   and their students' ability to explore and retain programming content.
   In this mixed-methods study, quantitative and qualitative data were
   collected from N = 6 teachers and N = 222 Kindergarten through second
   grade students at six schools across the United States. These teachers
   and students participated in an investigation of the relationship
   between teaching styles and student learning outcomes. All participants
   engaged in a minimum of two lessons and a maximum of seven lessons using
   the ScratchJr programming environment to introduce coding. Teachers
   reported on their classroom structure, lesson plan, teaching style and
   comfort with technology. They also administered ScratchJr Solve It
   assessments to capture various aspects of students' programming
   comprehension, which were analyzed for trends in learning outcomes.
   Results from this descriptive, exploratory study show that all students
   were successful in attaining foundational ScratchJr programming
   comprehension. Statistically significant findings revealed higher
   programming achievement in students whose educators demonstrated
   flexibility in lesson planning, responsiveness to student needs,
   technological content expertise, and concern for developing students'
   independent thinking. Implications for research in the development of
   computational thinking strategies are discussed, as well as suggestions
   for successfully implementing early childhood classroom interventions
   with ScratchJr.},

Title = {Unplugged or plugged-in programming learning: A comparative experimental
   study},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {184},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In recent years, computer programming has reappeared in school curricula
   with the aim of transmitting knowledge and skills beyond the simple
   ability to code. However, there are different ways of teaching this
   subject and very few experimental studies compare plugged-in and
   unplugged programming learning. The purpose of this study is to
   highlight the impact of plugged-in or unplugged learning on students'
   performance and subjective experience. To this end, we designed an
   experimental study with 217 primary school students divided into two
   groups and we measured their knowledge of computational concepts,
   ability to solve algorithmic problem, motivation toward the instruction,
   self-belief and attitude toward science. The programming sessions were
   designed to be similar between the two conditions, only the tools were
   different. Computers and Scratch software were used in the plugged-in
   group while the unplugged group used paper instructions, pictures,
   figurines and body movements instead. The results show better learning
   performance in the plugged-in group. Furthermore, although motivation
   dropped slightly in both groups, this drop was only significant in the
   unplugged condition. Gender also seems to be an important factor, as
   girls exhibit a lower post-test motivation and a lower willingness to
   pursue their practice in programming outside the school context.
   However, this effect on motivation was only observable in the plugged-in
   group which suggests that educational programming software may have a
   positive but gendered motivational impact.},

   Different Approaches},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTING EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Teaching programming to beginners is a complex task. In this article,
   the effects of three factors-choice of programming language,
   problem-solving training, and the use of formative assessment-on
   learning to program were investigated. The study adopted an iterative
   methodological approach carried out across 4 consecutive years. To
   evaluate the effects of each factor (implemented as a single change in
   each iteration) on students' learning performance, the study used
   quantitative, objective metrics. The findings revealed that using a
   syntactically simple language (Python) instead of a more complex one
   (Java) facilitated students' learning of programming concepts. Moreover,
   teaching problem solving before programming yielded significant
   improvements in student performance. These two factors were found to
   have variable effects on the acquisition of basic programming concepts.
   Finally, it was observed that effective formative feedback in the
   context of introductory programming depends on multiple parameters. The
   article discusses the implications of these findings, identifies avenues
   for further research, and argues for the importance of studies in
   computer science education anchored on sound research methodologies to
   produce generalizable results.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of using Facebook on
   enriching the learning experiences of students in programming learning.
   In another word, the aim of the study is to detect the reflections from
   the environment of programming learning where Facebook is used. The
   study was carried out within the scope of the Introduction to
   Programming and Algorithm course taught in the software engineering
   department of the technology faculty of a university in Turkey.
   Initially, a Facebook group was created to enrich classroom teaching.
   Sixty-three freshman engineering students taking the course and the
   faculty members of the department joined the group. The study was
   conducted for one semester in the fall semester of the 2014-2015
   academic year. The Educational Usage of Facebook Scale (EUFS) and
   semi-structured interview form were used as data collection tools in the
   study. Quantitative data were descriptively analyzed while qualitative
   data were subjected to content analysis. The results obtained in this
   study show that Facebook has positive effects such as providing a rich
   content in programming learning, increasing extracurricular
   communication, offering a cooperative and collaborative learning
   environment, increasing motivation, and bringing different perspectives
   as well as negative effects such as causing distraction, decreasing
   face-to-face communication, and bringing about problems about expressing
   oneself. As a result, it is possible to assert that Facebook can be
   efficiently used to support classroom teaching strategies and enrich
   learning experiences in programming learning. (c) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {Learning programming requires various skills and knowledge that novice
   programmers are expected to obtain in a limited time frame during
   introductory programming courses. Students are often introduced to
   programming for the first time at the university and overwhelmed with
   different programming languages and paradigms. Teachers are changing
   strategies and educational researchers are analyzing the data to suggest
   different paths. However, long-term studies in learning and teaching
   programming are not that common. In this research we present the

Title = {Predicting implementation of active learning by tenure-track teaching

Abstract = {Background The University of California system has a novel tenure-track
   education-focused faculty position called Lecturer with Security of
   Employment (working titles: Teaching Professor or Professor of
   Teaching). We focus on the potential difference in implementation of
   active-learning strategies by faculty type, including tenure-track
   education-focused faculty, tenure-track research-focused faculty, and
   non-tenure-track lecturers. In addition, we consider other instructor
   characteristics (faculty rank, years of teaching, and gender) and
   classroom characteristics (campus, discipline, and class size). We use a
   robust clustering algorithm to determine the number of clusters,
   identify instructors using active learning, and to understand the
   instructor and classroom characteristics in relation to the adoption of
   active-learning strategies. Results We observed 125 science, technology,
   engineering, and mathematics (STEM) undergraduate courses at three
   University of California campuses using the Classroom Observation
   Protocol for Undergraduate STEM to examine active-learning strategies
   implemented in the classroom. Tenure-track education-focused faculty are
   more likely to teach with active-learning strategies compared to
   tenure-track research-focused faculty. Instructor and classroom
   characteristics that are also related to active learning include campus,
   discipline, and class size. The campus with initiatives and programs to
   support undergraduate STEM education is more likely to have instructors
   who adopt active-learning strategies. There is no difference in
   instructors in the Biological Sciences, Engineering, or Information and
   Computer Sciences disciplines who teach actively. However, instructors
   in the Physical Sciences are less likely to teach actively. Smaller
   class sizes also tend to have instructors who teach more actively.
   Conclusions The novel tenure-track education-focused faculty position
   within the University of California system represents a formal structure
   that results in higher adoption of active-learning strategies in
   undergraduate STEM education. Campus context and evolving expectations
   of the position (faculty rank) contribute to the symbols related to
   learning and teaching that correlate with differential implementation of
   active learning.},

Title = {Computer programming in primary schools: Swedish Technology Teachers'
   pedagogical strategies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 21},
Abstract = {There is a recognized need for research on how to teach computer
   programming in primary schools in Sweden grades 4-6 (10-12-year-old
   pupils). Studies of teaching show the importance of teachers' knowledge
   of content and pedagogy and how these two parts affect each other (i.e.
   pedagogical content knowledge {[}PCK]). Most teachers in Sweden have
   little or no formal education in computer programming, the revised
   Swedish curriculum requires them to teach it. The aim of this study is
   to explore the pedagogical strategies teachers use when they teach
   computer programming. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14
   participants, comprising 12 teachers and 2 teacher trainers. The data
   were analysed deductively with themes from previous research. The
   results show that teachers use eight pedagogical strategies, including
   three new strategies that have been constructed inductively:
   do-it-yourself, gamification and progression. These eight pedagogical
   strategies are mostly general, and teachers may be considered regressed
   experts, as they lack formal training in computer programming. They
   facilitate learning in a general sense, but, compared to other subjects,
   their PCK in computer programming is problematized. In-service teacher
   training is needed to increase content knowledge, thus enabling to
   develop PCK in computer programming. It would also be fruitful to deepen
   our knowledge regarding pedagogical strategies in the PCK domain of
   computer programming.},

Abstract = {Improving the ethical thinking and analysis of university students is
   becoming an essential goal of modern curricula and program designers in
   various disciplines. To support ethics learning via practical
   applications and decision-making scenarios, ethics instructors are
   adding innovative methods to their multidisciplinary courses by
   following creative teaching practices and including diverse activities
   inside and outside the classroom. In this paper, a review of activities
   that promote ethics learning and engagement of undergraduate students is
   presented as a guide to devise a comprehensive framework for applying
   and promoting ethics. Ethics centers are also introduced as
   well-organized hubs that plan, organize, and host activities to support
   ethics teaching and enhance student intellectual growth and community
   services. The paper is enriched with numerous examples of activities and
   strategies for instructors and incentives for students extracted from an
   intensive review conducted on more than 60 ethics centers and 40 syllabi
   of ethics courses offered in international colleges and universities.},

Abstract = {This article presents an experience of teaching a course in the second
   year of a Mechanical Engineering program. Namely, Strength of Materials
   which is a course of 6 ECTS points. The objective is to improve the
   learning process, to develop students `competences and skills and to
   create opportunities for interaction among students and lecturers.
   Several active learning strategies have been applied in the course.
   Numerous approaches have been incorporated in the lectures, making use
   of varied teaching methodologies such as master class, active learning
   (AL) and problem-based learning (PBL). The actions introduced in the
   practical lectures are focused in program specific and professional
   competences related to the academic discipline, it aimed also to train
   core and cross-cultural competences such as management of information,
   team work and development of technical reports. At the end of the course
   a questionnaire was administered in order to analyse which of these
   activities is the one students believe has the greatest influence on the
   learning process.},

Abstract = {Teaching computer programming is a real challenge in the State
   University of Milagro (UNEMI), located in one of the least-developed
   zones in Ecuador, a non-WEIRD country (WEIRD stands for Western,
   Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic). Despite the application
   of various learning strategies, the historical pass rate does not exceed
   43\%. To solve this problem, we have relied on visual programming
   languages, specifically Scratch. Scratch is an open source software to
   learn programming that has a strong assumption of the benefits of
   community work. A quasi-experiment conducted with 74 undergraduate
   students during the first semester of CS showed that: (1) Both groups
   (control and experimental) are homogeneous in terms of their demographic
   characteristics, previous academic performance and motivation
   (expectations) concerning the course; (2) Scratch is strongly accepted
   by students in the experimental group and concerning the learning
   process, both groups showed similar levels of satisfaction; (3) the
   experimental group showed a pass rate four times higher than the control
   group; (4) in general, student success is associated with having learned
   programming with Scratch. While limited, our results are an important
   step in our road to improve the learning of programming in a low social
   status area of Ecuador.},

Title = {Comparative Analysis of Energy Management Strategies for HEV: Dynamic
   Programming and Reinforcement Learning},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Abstract = {Energy management strategy is an important factor in determining the
   fuel economy of hybrid electric vehicles; thus, much research on how to
   distribute the required power to engines and motors of hybrid vehicles
   is required. Recently, various studies have been conducted based on
   reinforcement learning to optimally control the hybrid electric vehicle.
   In fact, the fundamental control approach of reinforcement learning
   shares many control frameworks with the control approach by using
   deterministic dynamic programming or stochastic dynamic programming. In
   this study, we compare the reinforcement learning based strategy by
   using these dynamic programming-based control approaches. For optimal
   control of hybrid electric vehicle, each control method was compared in
   terms of fuel efficiency by performing simulation by using various
   driving cycles. Based on our simulations, we showed the reinforcement
   learning-based strategy can obtain global optimality in the optimal
   control problem with an infinite horizon, which can also be obtained by
   stochastic dynamic programming. We also showed that the reinforcement
   learning-based strategy can present a solution close to the optimal one
   using deterministic dynamic programming, while a reinforcement
   learning-based strategy is more appropriate for a time variant
   controller with boundary value constraints. In addition, we verified the
   convergence characteristics of the control strategy based on
   reinforcement learning, when transfer learning was performed through
   value initialization using stochastic dynamic programming.},

Title = {A game-based approach to the teaching of object-oriented programming
   languages},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Students often have difficulties when trying to understand the concepts
   of object-oriented programming (OOP). This paper presents a contribution
   to the teaching of OOP languages through a game-oriented approach based
   on the interaction with tangible user interfaces (This). The use of a
   specific type of commercial distributed TUI (Sifteo cubes), in which
   several small physical devices have sensing, wireless communication and
   user-directed output capabilities, is applied to the teaching of the C\#
   programming language, since the operation of these devices can be
   controlled by user programs written in C\#. For our experiment, we
   selected a sample of students with a sufficient knowledge about
   procedural programming, which was divided into two groups: The first one
   had a standard introductory C\# course, whereas the second one had an
   experimental C\# course that included, in addition to the contents of
   the previous one, two demonstration programs that illustrated some OOP
   basic concepts using the TUI features. Finally, both groups completed
   two tests: a multiple-choice exam for evaluating the acquisition of
   basic OOP concepts and a C\# programming exercise. The analysis of the
   results from the tests indicates that the group of students that
   attended the course including the TUI demos showed a higher interest
   level (i.e. they felt more motivated) during the course exposition than
   the one that attended the standard introductory C\# course. Furthermore,
   the students from the experimental group achieved an overall better
   mark. Therefore, we can conclude that the technological contribution of
   Sifteo cubes - used as a distributed TUI by which OOP basic concepts are
   represented in a tangible and a visible way - to the teaching of the C\#
   language has a positive influence on the learning of this language and
   such basic concepts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Distance education has gone through rapid expansion over the years. Many
   Australian universities are pushing the use of distance education in
   delivering construction education programs. However, the critical
   success factors (CSFs) in distance learning construction programs
   (DLCPs) are not fully understood. More importantly, students'
   demographic features may affect the selection of distance education
   technologies. Situation-matching strategies should therefore be taken by
   universities or institutions with different student cohorts. A survey is
   adopted in Central Queensland University (CQU) to identify and rank the
   critical success factors in a DLCP in Australia where there is a
   significant number of earner-learners and students with low
   socioeconomic background. The findings suggest that the most important
   CSFs include access to computers and internet, reliability of web-based
   learning sites, high relevance and clarity of learning materials and
   assessment items, the availability of web-based learning sites that can
   be easily manipulated, and the capability of the instructors to provide
   well-structured courses. The findings also suggest that students with
   low socioeconomic background have more rigorous requirements on
   interface design, instructors' support, and the integration of practical
   components into courses. The results provide good guidance of the design
   and delivery of DLCPs and will be useful for universities and
   institutions that are seeking to implement the distance mode in
   construction education. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Abstract = {Online learning platforms provide an opportunity to better understand
   students weaknesses by tracking both their learning behavior and
   knowledge. This information can then be used to assist teachers in
   making instructional decisions and to further guide those who are at
   risk of failure. In this paper, we tracked student learning data from a
   C programming course over a whole semester of their freshman year via
   the Trustie platform. A total of 17,854 code submissions were collected.
   We then used CppCheck, SonarQube and Trustie to capture the quality
   characteristics and submission characteristics of the code, including
   lineOfCode, cyclomaticComplexity, codeSmell, syntacticError,
   averageScore, submission, and logicError, and analyzed the impact of
   code quality on the assignment work results. Several factors were
   discovered that we believe can help teachers to develop more effective
   teaching strategies.},

Abstract = {This study examined the influence of distance teaching implementation,
   online material guidance, and teaching effectiveness on student learning
   outcomes. The results indicated that both distance teaching
   implementation and online material guidance positively affect learning
   outcomes. These results supported the conclusion that the relationship
   between teaching effectiveness and learning outcomes is curvilinear. The
   results also indicated that a competent instructor plays a crucial role
   in improving student learning outcomes in the distance learning context
   and revealed that the adoption of quality online materials should be
   based on the specific instructional objectives and learning strategies
   of each course. Furthermore, the interactive distance learning
   environment can reduce alienation and increase enrollment through
   videoconferencing.},

Abstract = {Veterinary medical students, similar to elite collegiate athletes, are
   developing strategies for learning new skills and for self-care to take
   their performance to the next level. As veterinary students learn to
   successfully navigate an information-dense, high-volume curriculum, many
   sacrifice wellness, leadership opportunities, extracurricular
   activities, and social interactions. Strategies from athletes' physical
   training were used to design a self-study program for first-year
   veterinary medical students. Major considerations in program design were
   the characteristics of the human being, learning goals, and contextual
   constraints. The study program included a warm-up, study sessions, and a
   cooldown. The program was offered to first-year veterinary medical
   students at Purdue University's College of Veterinary Medicine.
   Thirty-two students requested study programs and 21 completed surveys at
   the semester end. Results were analyzed quantitatively and by using an
   adapted conventional content analysis approach. Responses were organized
   into three main domains: reason for participation, program utility, and
   program satisfaction. Students shared that the most helpful aspects of
   the program were assisting with organization and time management,
   providing accountability, and reducing overwhelm by enhancing well-being
   and performance; they reported that these learned skills would support
   their well-being as future professionals. This article describes the
   experiences of one group of veterinary students at one college using
   these programs. The long-term goal is to develop a model program for all
   veterinary students to manage curricular demands while maintaining
   well-being.},

Abstract = {Recent research shows the importance to teach students the
   self-regulated use of effective learning strategies at university.
   However, the effects of such training programs on students'
   metacognitive knowledge, use of learning strategies, and academic
   performance in the longer term are unknown. In the present study, all
   first-year pharmacology students from one university attended a learning
   strategy training program, i.e., the `Study Smart program', in their
   first weeks. The 20\% (n = 25) lowest scoring students on the first
   midterm received further support regarding their learning strategies.
   Results showed that all students gained accurate metacognitive knowledge
   about (in)effective learning strategies in the short- and long-term and
   reported to use less highlighting, less rereading, but more
   interleaving, elaboration, and distributed practice after the training
   program. Academic performance was compared to the prior cohort, which
   had not received the Study Smart program. While in the previous cohort,
   students in the top, middle, and bottom rank of midterm 1 stayed in
   these ranks and still differed significantly in the final exam, students
   in the Study Smart cohort that received the training program improved
   throughout the year and differences between ranks were significantly
   reduced. A learning strategy training program including a remediation
   track for lower performing students can thus support students to study
   more effectively and enhance equal chances for all students at
   university.},

Title = {Veterinary Educator Teaching and Scholarship (VETS): A Case Study of a

Abstract = {Content expertise in basic science and clinical disciplines does not
   assure proficiency in teaching. Faculty development to improve teaching
   and learning is essential for the advancement of veterinary education.
   The Consortium of West Region Colleges of Veterinary Medicine
   established the Regional Teaching Academy (RTA) with the focus of
   ``Making Teaching Matter.{''} The objective of the RTA's first effort,
   the Faculty Development Initiative (FDI), was to develop a
   multi-institutional faculty development program for veterinary educators
   to learn about and integrate effective teaching methods. In 2016, the
   Veterinary Educator Teaching and Scholarship (VETS) program was piloted
   at Oregon State University's College of Veterinary Medicine. This
   article uses a case study approach to program evaluation of the VETS
   program. We describe the VETS program, participants' perceptions,
   participants' teaching method integration, and lessons learned. A
   modified Kirkpatrick Model (MKM) was used to categorize program outcomes
   and impact. Quantitative data are presented as descriptive statistics,
   and qualitative data are presented as the themes that emerged from
   participant survey comments and post-program focus groups. Results
   indicated outcomes and impacts that included participants' perceptions
   of the program, changes in participant attitude toward teaching and
   learning, an increase in the knowledge level of participants,
   self-reported changes in participant behaviors, and changes in practices
   and structure at the college level. Lessons learned indicate that the
   following are essential for program success: (1) providing institutional
   and financial support; (2) creating a community of practice (COP) of
   faculty development facilitators, and (3) developing a program that
   addresses the needs of faculty and member institutions.},

Title = {Closing the gender gap in an introductory programming course},

Abstract = {Although there is a growing interest in learning to program, the number
   of women involved in programming remains surprisingly low. We don't
   understand completely the causes but it has become clear that men and
   women have different perceptions of programming. The pedagogy of
   introductory programming courses should take these differences into
   account. In this study we analyze gender differences in an introductory
   programming course at the university level. Our results indicate that
   male and female students have different perceptions and learning
   outcomes: male students find programming easier, have a higher intention
   to program in the future and show higher learning outcomes than female
   students. To reduce these differences we have designed and implemented
   several learning modules using the principles of physical computing. The
   physical computing approach aims to take computational concepts out of
   the screen and into the real world so that students can interact with
   them. We have applied these modules in a MATLAB introductory programming
   course in a biology degree. When using these modules both male and
   female students showed similar results in perceptions and learning
   outcomes. The use of physical computing principles in combination with
   the traditional methodology reduced actually closed this gender gap. (C)

Abstract = {Introduction Programming can be an intellectually satisfying skill and
   is definitely considered useful. However, problem-solving with a
   computer involves much more than just learning programming language
   syntax. The theory and practice are interrelated in fascinating ways.
   Whether one thinks that the purpose of college or higher education is to
   prepare students for an occupation or to develop foundational knowledge
   with lifetime benefits (or both), computer science (CS) has become a
   fundamental part of 21st-century life. Even students studying in areas
   other than CS are likely to have significant encounters with
   computational thinking (CT) later on in life.
   Motivation and Objectives Colleges and universities offer the
   opportunity for students to take as many courses as they desire in
   coding, programming, and CS taught by faculty members from that
   discipline area. However, this approach alone is deemed insufficient for
   computer-based problem-solving and computer programming. Effective
   programming teaching pedagogy also requires organizational principles
   that can guide us in formulating the overall design of a programming
   science curriculum (CS). In particular, we need strategies that help us
   structure multiple paradigm-based teaching curricula into manageable
   modules. This study aims to develop a framework for programming
   pedagogy.
   Research Methodology and Methods A systematic literature review was
   conducted for identifying, evaluating, and interpreting relevant
   research to explore programming paradigms that could be incorporated for
   novice programmers, possible implementation strategies, and
   instructional methods for teaching text-based programming, CT concepts,
   and practices.
   Results and Findings This paper's focus was on the pedagogical
   phenomenon of teaching programming considering the evolving paradigms,
   implementation strategies, and instructional methods and techniques
   through the lens of CT. Hence, a framework to design a learning path for
   pedagogical approaches that consist of CT concepts and practices within
   text-based programming were proposed. The proposed framework is based on
   the assumption that ``any ongoing research on computing pedagogy
   requires a review of what CT is, how it impacts on teaching and learning
   and its role within the pedagogy advocated.{''} The programming pedagogy
   framework consists of four fundamental components: programming paradigm,
   implementation strategy, instructional methods, and instructional
   techniques.},

Title = {A scalable learning algorithm for data-driven program analysis},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {104},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Context: Recently data-driven program analysis has emerged as a
   promising approach for building cost-effective static analyzers. The
   ideal static analyzer should apply accurate but costly techniques only
   when they benefit. However, designing such a strategy for real-world
   programs is highly nontrivial and requires labor-intensive work. The
   goal of data-driven program analysis is to automate this process by
   learning the strategy from data through a learning algorithm.
   Objective: Current learning algorithms for data-driven program analysis
   are not scalable enough to be used with large codebases. The objective
   of this paper is to overcome this shortcoming and present a new
   algorithm that is able to efficiently learn a strategy from large
   codebases.
   Method: The key idea is to use an oracle and transform the existing
   blackbox learning problem into a whitebox one that is much easier to
   solve. The oracle quantifies the relative importance of each part of the
   program with respect to the analysis precision. The oracle can be
   obtained by running the most and least precise analyses only once over
   the codebase.
   Results: Our learning algorithm is much faster than the existing
   algorithms while producing high quality strategies. The evaluation is
   done with 140 open-source C programs, comprising of 2.1 MLoC in total.
   Learning at this large scale was previously impractical.
   Conclusion: Our work advances the state-of-the-art of data-driven
   program analysis by addressing the scalability issue of the existing
   learning algorithm. Our technique will make the data-driven approach
   more practical in the real-world.},

Title = {Comparing the effect of lecture and Jigsaw teaching strategies on the
   nursing students' self-regulated learning and academic motivation: A
   quasi-experimental study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {79},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background In cooperative learning approach, the active and direct
   involvement of the learner in the learning process leads to a
   comprehensive development. Self-regulated learning and academic
   motivation focus on the role of the individual in the teaching-learning
   process.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the comparing of
   lecture and Jigsaw teaching strategies on the nursing students'
   self-regulated learning and academic motivation.
   Methods: This was a quasi-experimental conducted from January to
   November 2018 on 94 nursing students in the fourth education semester in
   two classrooms. A classroom was randomly assigned to the lecture group
   and the other as a Jigsaw group. The data collection tools were
   demographic data questionnaire, self-regulated learning questionnaire,
   and academic motivation scale. The interventions were lecture and Jigsaw
   teaching strategy for seven sessions lasting for 2 h in the lecture and
   Jigsaw groups respectively. Data was collected before and after the
   interventions. Finally, data was analyzed using Kolmogorov-Smirnoff
   test, paired t-test, independent t-test via the PASW-22 software.
   Results: There was no statistically significant differences between the
   groups in terms of self-regulated learning and academic motivation
   before the interventions (P = 0.59, P = 0.38), but after the
   interventions, the mean scores of self-regulated learning and academic
   motivation were significantly different in Jigsaw group from that of the
   lecture group (P = 0.000).
   Conclusions: The Jigsaw teaching strategy can be used for nursing
   student's theoretical education to improve the self-regulated learning
   and academic motivation.},

Title = {Modified task-based learning program promotes problem-solving capacity
   among Chinese medical postgraduates: a mixed quantitative survey},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {SEP 7},
Abstract = {Background: Despite great advances, China's postgraduate education faces
   many problems, for example traditional lecture-based learning (LBL)
   method provides fewer oppotunities to apply knowledge in a working
   situation. Task-based learning (TBL) is an efficient strategy for
   increasing the connections among skills, knowledge and competences. This
   study aimed to evaluate the effect of a modified TBL model on
   problem-solving abilities among postgraduate medical students in China.
   Methods: We allocated 228 first-year postgraduate students at Third
   Military Medical University into two groups: the TBL group and LBL
   group. The TBL group was taught using a TBL program for
   immunohistochemistry. The curriculum consisted of five phases: task
   design, self-learning, experimental operations, discussion and summary.
   The LBL group was taught using traditional LBL. After the course,
   learning performance was assessed using theoretical and practical tests.
   The students' preferences and satisfaction of TBL and LBL were also
   evaluated using questionnaires.
   Results: There were notable differences in the mean score rates in the
   practical test (P < 0.05): the number of high scores (> 80) in the TBL
   group was higher than that in the LBL group. We observed no substantial
   differences in the theoretical test between the two groups (P > 0.05).
   The questionnaire results indicated that the TBL students were satisfied
   with teaching content, teaching methods and experiment content. The TBL
   program was also beneficial for the postgraduates in completing their
   research projects. Furthermore, the TBL students reported positive
   effects in terms of innovative thinking, collaboration, and
   communication.
   Conclusions: TBL is a powerful educational strategy for postgraduate
   education in China. Our modified TBL imparted basic knowledge to the
   students and also engaged them more effectively in applying knowledge to
   solve real-world issues. In conclusion, our TBL established a good
   foundation for the students' future in both medical research and
   clinical work.},

Abstract = {Computer programming courses are mandatory for many majors. However, the
   high rate of failures shows that students have difficulties in
   assimilating the topics. The objective of this research is to understand
   these difficulties. Analyzing diaries filled out by students and
   interviews with instructors, we identified difficulties related to
   language and understanding and some strategies used to mitigate them.
   The analysis and understanding of the difficulties may support the
   creation of teaching strategies and tools to facilitate the teaching and
   learning of computer programming.},

Title = {Peer-teaching at the University of Rwanda - a qualitative study based on
   self-determination theory},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {BackgroundPeer-teaching is an educational format in which one student
   teaches one, or more, fellow students. Self-determination theory
   suggests that intrinsic motivation increases with the enhancement of
   autonomy, competence and relatedness.AimsThis qualitative study sought
   to explore and better understand the lived experiences, attitudes and
   perceptions of medical students as peer-teachers at the University of
   Rwanda when participating in a peer-learning intervention in the
   pediatric department.MethodsStudents participated in a 3-h peer-taught
   symposium, supervised by a pediatric specialist or resident. Students
   worked in small groups to deliver a short didactic presentation related
   to acute illness in children. The symposium prepared the students for
   simulation-based teaching activities. In-depth, semi-structured,
   interviews were then employed to explore the students' experiences of
   the peer-teaching symposium. We specifically aimed to scaffold the
   analysis of these experiences on the themes of autonomy, competence and
   relatedness.ResultsSaturation was achieved after interviews with ten
   students. Students described developing their own autonomous learning
   strategies, but despite developing this autonomy had a desire for
   support in the delivery of the sessions. Competence was developed
   through enhanced learning of the material, developing teaching skills
   and confidence in public speaking. Students valued the different aspects
   of relatedness that developed through preparing and delivering the
   peer-teaching. Several other themes were identified during the
   interviews, which are not described here, namely; i. Satisfaction with
   peer-teaching; ii. Peer-teaching as a concept; iii. Practical issues
   related to the peer-teaching session, and iv. Teaching style from
   faculty.ConclusionsThis is the first study to assess peer-learning
   activities in Rwanda. It has used qualitative methods to deeply explore
   the lived experiences, attitudes and perceptions of medical students.
   The peer-teaching strategy used here demonstrates the potential to
   enhance intrinsic motivation while increasing knowledge acquisition and
   teaching skills. We postulate that students in resource-limited
   settings, similar to Rwanda, would benefit from peer-teaching
   activities, and in doing so could enhance their intrinsic motivation.},

Title = {Blended Teaching Practices for Active Learning in Higher Pharmacy

Abstract = {Background: Blended adoption of active learning practices improves
   student achievement on average in college. Nevertheless, there have been
   few studies to date on the effects of detailed factors on learning
   outcomes. Objectives: The aim of this study was to develop a blended
   teaching strategy by incorporating methods of team-based learning (TBL)
   and e-learning into a Pharmaceutical Analysis course for student active
   learning, and to explore how the practice impacts student learning
   outcomes. Materials and Methods: Two blended teaching programs with
   different blending ratios of TBL and e-learning methods were developed
   and compared in this study. Students from four experimental classes
   enrolled in three majors were recruited. Student outcomes related to
   active learning goals were evaluated using formative and summative
   evaluation methods. A survey administered after the study was completed.
   Results: Student e-learning performance was positively correlated with
   the final scores, suggesting that exercises and tests provided by the
   e-learning platform made a positive contribution to student knowledge
   achievement. On surveys a large majority of students reported that
   working on instructor-posed questions in a TBL setting improved their
   higher-order cognitive skills, social cohesion and, through that,
   feelings of accountability. Final scores showed significant differences
   among students from different majors, which implied that the
   effectiveness of active learning depends on the characteristics of
   students and their activities outside of class. Conclusion: The blended
   teaching strategy developed in this study was effective in improving
   student achievement in either formative or summative assessments, which
   provides an accessible and informative entry point for implementing
   active learning in higher pharmacy education.},

Abstract = {This article reports the results of a study of the relationship of
   computer game programming to computational learning (CL). The results
   contribute to the growing body of knowledge about how to define and
   measure CL among children by proposing a new concept, Game Computational
   Sophistication (GCS). We analyzed 231 games programmed by 325 11 and 12
   year olds with a range of prior computer experience who attended a
   voluntary technology class during or after school. Findings suggest that
   students' games exhibited a range of GCS: programs composed of sequences
   of simple programming constructs; programs composed of programming
   constructs, some of which are used to implement higher-order patterns;
   and programs composed of game mechanics built from combinations of
   patterns ``glued{''} together with simple programming constructs. We use
   case studies of students' games to illustrate how variation in the use
   and integration of programming constructs, patterns, and game mechanics
   can be used to demonstrate evidence of CL. The study contributes to an
   understanding of what CL looks like in middle school, how to assess it,
   and how game-programming activities might promote CL.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic affected almost all aspects of our lives,
   including the education sector and the way of teaching and learning. In
   March 2020, health authorities in Brazil imposed social isolation and
   the interruption of on-site activities in schools and universities. In
   this context, the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), one of the
   largest universities in Brazil and Latin America, developed an emergency
   remote learning (ERL) plan that allowed the return of classes in an
   online format and supported students to obtain access to equipment and
   internet network. Within this new perspective, the Undergraduate
   Teaching Assistant (UTA) program of the Department of Physiology and
   Biophysics (DFIB) explored strategies to minimize the impact of the
   absence of face-to-face classes. Using different available tools in
   online platforms and social media such as Microsoft Teams, YouTube
   animated video classes, and Instagram, the UTA program assisted >500
   undergraduate students and strongly supported professors during ERL. In
   just over a year, our video classes on YouTube Channel reached similar
   to 40,000 views. Most of the students reported that their questions were
   fully and quickly solved by the UTA program. Collectively, our results
   indicate that the strategies implemented by the UTA program helped the
   undergraduate students and professors to adapt to a remote learning
   format.},

Abstract = {Programming is an important skill for different areas of knowledge.
   While in the past, programming skills were much more related to fields
   of computer sciences and engineering, today, professionals from
   different areas benefit from the ability to write codes for different
   applications. Furthermore, programming stimulates logical thinking,
   which impacts other personal abilities. Health science students have
   limited exposure to programming during their studies. Aware of this and
   considering the prolonged time in social distancing in Brazil due to the
   SARS-COV2 pandemic in 2020, we organized an outreach course dedicated to
   teaching introductory concepts of programming for health science
   students. The activity was developed fully online using the Zoom web
   conference agent, lasting 12 wk (8 synchronous classes, 15 synchronous
   hours in total), and attended by 27 undergraduate and graduate students
   from two different universities. A collaborative problem-based learning
   and group-learning methodology were developed through asynchronous
   homework and mainly online synchronous activities. In this article, we
   describe our approach and provide some suggestions for replicating the
   course in other universities. We observed that the activities of the
   outreach course improved programming skills and confidence for most of
   the students. More importantly, it piqued their interest enough to
   motivate them to continue to practice writing and testing their
   programs. We concluded that an outreach course dedicated to programming
   promoted improvements in programming skills in health science students.
   Furthermore, the program was an opportunity to keep the students active
   in science while working from their homes during the pandemic.},

Abstract = {Outcome-based education (OBE) is a well-proven teaching strategy based
   upon a predefined set of expected outcomes. The components of OBE are
   Program Educational Objectives (PEOs), Program Outcomes (POs), and
   Course Outcomes (COs). These latter are assessed at the end of each
   course and several recommended actions can be proposed by faculty
   members' to enhance the quality of courses and therefore the overall
   educational program. Considering a large number of courses and the
   faculty members' devotion, bad actions could be recommended and
   therefore undesirable and inappropriate decisions may occur. In this
   paper, a recommender system, using different machine learning
   algorithms, is proposed for predicting suitable actions based on course
   specifications, academic records, and course learning outcomes'
   assessments. We formulated the problem as a multi-label multi-class
   binary classification problem and the dataset was translated into
   different problem transformation and adaptive methods such as
   one-vs.-all, binary relevance, label powerset, classifier chain, and
   ML-KNN adaptive classifier. As a case study, the proposed recommender
   system is applied to the college of Computer and Information Sciences,
   Jouf University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) for helping academic
   staff improving the quality of teaching strategies. The obtained results
   showed that the proposed recommender system presents more recommended
   actions for improving students' learning experiences.},

Abstract = {Introduction and purpose: As regular and well-structured clerkship
   program is needed to graduate qualified pharmacists in regard to drug
   knowledge and clinical skills our study was conducted in order to
   describe an innovative educational strategy for the outpatient clerkship
   and to improve the quality of clinical education in undergraduate doctor
   of pharmacy program. Method: Twenty one pharm D students were asked to
   fill an 18-questions questionnaire which designed to evaluate the
   course. The questionnaire used a 5-level Likert item to meet students'
   response to each question ranging from 1-{''}strongly agree{''} to
   5-{''}strongly disagree{''}. The pharmacy training was also evaluated
   through pharmacist evaluation (in each of the training pharmacies) for
   the course. Results: All students responded to the questionnaire
   (response rate 100\%). Students were highly satisfied about the
   helpfulness of the course and the positive impact of the course on their
   clinical skills. Students were also highly satisfied about the clarity
   of the clerkship, clinic training and the type of homework, but they
   were less satisfied regarding the course material. Students showed a
   good satisfaction regarding the hands-on activities during the clerkship
   Finally, students were satisfied regarding the method of teaching and
   student's performance assessment method, whereas they show a poor
   satisfaction regarding the time distribution during the clerkship and
   most of them stated that the clerkship need more than 3 weeks.
   Discussion: Our program approach produced a positive outcome and
   satisfaction from the students regarding the most issues related
   clerkship evaluation. Therefore, this new teaching program could be
   continued and implemented in the future clerkship as a method for
   outpatient clerkship teaching.},

Abstract = {Researchers and educators continuously remark on the importance of
   integrating creativity into the learning process. This study proposes a
   creativity approach to facilitating participatory learning for the
   sustained engagement of young learners based on the principle of remix
   practice, which consists of learning to generate online artefacts,
   endless hybridization and scaffolding. This study investigated students'
   engagement in and perceptions of the creative learning process during a
   two-year participatory learning program. Data collected included
   students' flow perceptions during a 39-week activity, their motivation
   and creative self-efficacy before and after the intervention, as well as
   their creative products. The findings indicated that the remix-oriented
   approach led to a higher level of intrinsic motivation and sustained
   flow compared to a model-based approach, especially interest and
   curiosity, in this participatory learning program. The approach also
   helped the students to perceive a significant increase in their level of
   creative self-efficacy associated with strategies to generate creative
   ideas. The results of this study suggest that the principle of remix
   practice is helpful for leveraging knowledge acquisition and the
   creative nature of participatory learning activities to sustain student
   engagement in participatory learning programs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Although the teaching of programming has evolved over 50 years, all
   methodologies rely on a simple structure that was born a long time ago:
   the loop, shared by all high-level programming languages, and the
   preferred choice for any repetitive task programmers face. We analyze
   here how ``loops{''} skew the way programmers solve problems, and
   prevent them from taking advantage of the available parallel/distributed
   computing architectures. To do so, we state our initial hypothesis:
   eliminating loops will allow a more natural parallel programming
   approach. The idea is to mimic a common practice today that was
   established in the past for a different purpose: prohibiting goto
   statements to improve code maintainability. This paper describes a new
   computer programming teaching strategy that we tested for 7 years and
   provides evidence on how loop prohibition, in the context of Functional
   Programming, makes students aware of data dependencies and produces
   21st-century programmers who benefit from widely available parallel
   architectures.},

Title = {Effect of augmented reality-based virtual educational robotics on
   programming students' enjoyment of learning, computational thinking
   skills, and academic achievement},

Abstract = {The use of educational robotics for programming education has been shown
   to be effective in fostering students' computational thinking (CT)
   skills. However, physical educational robots are expensive, which may
   limit their wide use in the classroom. This study used augmented reality
   technology to develop a virtual educational robotic system (AR Bot for
   short), which offers 3D visual learning feedback to strengthen spatial
   ability, as well as delayed feedback and auto scoring feedback to
   promote students' deeper CT processes. To examine the impact of AR Bot
   on programming learning, this study used a quasi-experimental design to
   compare an experimental group of 41 first-year university students who
   used AR Bot and a control group of 34 first year university students who
   used Scratch. We assessed the impact of the two CT tools on students'
   internal learning processes (enjoyment of learning), CT skills (problem
   decomposition, algorithm design, and algorithm efficiency skills), and
   academic achievement. The results showed that students who used AR Bot
   had higher enjoyment of learning, algorithm design skills, and algorithm
   efficiency skills but not higher problem decomposition skills and
   academic achievement than students who used Scratch. Enjoyment of
   learning led to higher problem decomposition, algorithm design, and
   algorithm efficiency skills but not academic achievement. Problem
   decomposition and algorithm design skills, but not algorithm efficiency
   skills, led to academic achievement. The theoretical and practical
   implications of the proposed tool and other CT tools in programming
   education are discussed.},

Abstract = {Faculty development in veterinary education is receiving increasing
   attention internationally and is considered of particular importance
   during periods of organizational or curricular change. This report
   outlines a faculty development strategy developed since October 2012 at
   the University of Bristol Veterinary School, in parallel with the
   development and implementation of a new curriculum. The aim of the
   strategy is to deliver accessible, contextual faculty development
   workshops for clinical and non-clinical staff involved in veterinary
   student training, thereby equipping staff with the skills and support to
   deliver high-quality teaching in a modern curriculum. In October 2014,
   these workshops became embedded within the new University of Bristol
   Continuing Professional Development scheme, Cultivating Research and
   Teaching Excellence. This scheme ensures that staff have a clear and
   structured route to achieving formal recognition of their teaching
   practice as well as access to a wide range of resources to further their
   overall professional development. The key challenges and constraints are
   discussed.},

Title = {A web-based clinical pedagogy program to enhance registered nurse
   preceptors' teaching competencies - An innovative process of development
   and pilot program evaluation},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {84},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: Registered Nurse Preceptors guide students to integrate
   theory into practice, assess clinical competencies, and enhance
   problem-solving skills. Researches have indicated that the teaching
   competencies of nurse preceptors can be transferred to students'
   clinical learning.
   Objectives: The aims of the study are to develop a web-based clinical
   pedagogy (WCP) program for Registered Nurse Preceptors and conduct pilot
   program evaluation.
   Design: A three-step process was applied to integrate the theoretical
   framework, evidence from the systematic review, and content validity by
   the experts and pilot test with the Registered Nurse Preceptors in the
   content and technical development of the program. The WCP program has
   unique features including use of dashboard, interactive videos,
   consultation with experts, discussion forum and backend data analysis.
   Results: A committee of six content experts evaluated the
   comprehensiveness, appropriateness, and relevancy of the program. The
   item-Content Validity Index (CVI) score ranged from 0.83 to 1.00 and the
   scale-CVI score was 0.87, which indicated that the WCP program had a
   strong content validity. Ten nurse preceptors were invited to use the
   WCP program. Preceptors shared that the website was easy to use and
   navigate. They commented that the videos in each module are beneficial
   for nurses to understand the real situation in the clinical setting.
   This feature also makes the website more interactive. Feedback from
   preceptors was subsequently used to further refine the program.
   Discussion and conclusion: The WCP program is an evidence-based program
   that provides a comprehensive coverage on clinical teaching pedagogy and
   assessment strategies. The unique web-based technology and interactive
   features provide a platform for nurse preceptors to discuss clinical
   encounters with peers and consult experts. The flexible and
   resource-rich nature of web-based learning encourages nurses to use it
   for continuing education.},

Abstract = {Deep learning models are a class of approximate models that are proven
   to have strong predictive capabilities for representing complex
   phenomena. The introduction of deep learning models into an optimization
   formulation provides a means to reduce the problem complexity and
   maintain model accuracy. Recently it has been shown that deep learning
   models in the form of neural networks with rectified linear units can be
   exactly recast as a mixed-integer linear programming formulation.
   However, developing the optimal solution of problems involving
   mixed-integer decisions in online applications remains challenging.
   Multiparametric programming alleviates the online computational burden
   of solving an optimization problem involving bounded uncertain
   parameters. In this work, a strategy is presented to integrate deep
   learning and multiparametric programming. This integration yields a
   unified methodology for developing accurate surrogate models based on
   deep learning and their offline, explicit optimal solution. The proposed
   strategy is demonstrated on the optimal operation of a chemostat. (C)

Abstract = {Object-oriented programming (OOP) abstract concepts are often difficult
   to understand for students, since it is not easy to find the equivalence
   of such concepts in daily life. In this paper we will study if an
   interdisciplinary approach based on an introduction to robotics and
   robot programming helps the student in acquiring the OOP concepts. For
   our experiments, we selected a sample of thirty individuals among
   students with an adequate knowledge of procedural programming. This
   sample was divided into two groups of fifteen students each: for the
   first one we used a standard introductory approach to C\#, whereas for
   the second one we developed an experimental course that included a
   demonstration program that illustrated OOP basic concepts using the
   features of a specific type of commercial ball-shaped robot with
   sensing, wireless communication and output capabilities. After the
   courses, both groups were evaluated by completing a multiple-choice exam
   and a C\# programming exercise. Our results show that the student group
   that attended the course including the robot demo showed a higher
   interest level (i.e. they felt more motivated) than those students that
   attended the standard introductory C\# course. Furthermore, the students
   from the experimental group also achieved an overall better mark.},

Abstract = {This work presents the structure and results of an ongoing engineering
   faculty development program at a large private university in Chile. This
   program uses the conceptual change approach as a framework in a
   recursive way, and it is specially designed to promote and ensure the
   use of active and innovative methodologies. The development program
   consists of six steps that aim to strengthen a learning community that
   fosters interaction of professors with common problems, interests, and
   experiences in a way that the collegial work sustains over time the
   dynamic and improved incorporation of active methodologies for teaching
   and learning. For this paper, we focus on the structure and some
   results. The results are related to faculty, students and institutional
   perceptions. We have evidence that faculty in this program changes their
   own perceptions as instructors towards reflecting whether their role is
   less regarding to transmitting knowledge, notes, and presentations to
   students. In the case of students, after a survey in courses in which
   participants were implementing educational strategies from the program,
   students' view is positive towards the activities. Students indicated
   that they learned more and that those strategies should be used in other
   courses. Institutionally, the achievements of faculty in the program and
   the program itself received recognition by the university.},

Title = {An idiom-driven learning strategy to improve low achievers? science
   comprehension, motivation, and argumentation.},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {195},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This study aimed to explore the effects of an idiom-driven learning
   strategy on low achievers' (LAs') motivation, conceptional learning, and
   argumentation in science. A web-based idiomdriven learning program was
   developed according to the LAs' needs. The program included scaffoldings
   such as digital animation, science inquiry simulation, discussion
   blocks, and sentence templates. A quasi-experimental design was used
   with 362 8th graders identified as LAs due to their school science
   scores of the previous semester being in the first quartile. The
   students were randomly assigned to two experimental groups and one
   control group. The first experimental group received web-based
   idiom-driven learning strategy for instruction, and the second group
   received the same web-based instruction without idiom integration, while
   the control group received traditional instruction. Three types of
   science topics-descriptive, hypothetical, and theoretical-were
   systematically organized as learning materials, accompanied by three
   respective Chinese idioms: a mantis tries to stop a chariot; many a
   little makes a mickle; and mental telepathy. After nine weeks of
   instructions, the first experimental group demonstrated significantly
   higher performance in science. A number of factors related to the
   idiom-driven learning strategy-personification, humor, and
   metaphor-explained the experimental groups' better performance. The
   problem-solving learning context and the online scaffoldings were other
   factors that facilitated the students' multiple ideas and questions for
   argument. These positive results provide an opportunity for educators to
   change their traditional viewpoint that science argumentation in
   theoretical topics is always a difficult task for many LAs.},

Title = {The effects of integrating mobile devices with teaching and learning on

Abstract = {Mobile devices such as laptops, personal digital assistants, and mobile
   phones have become a learning tool with great potential in both
   classrooms and outdoor learning. Although there have been qualitative
   analyses of the use of mobile devices in education, systematic
   quantitative analyses of the effects of mobile-integrated education are
   lacking. This study performed a meta-analysis and research synthesis of
   the effects of integrated mobile devices in teaching and learning, in
   which 110 experimental and quasiexperimental journal articles published
   during the period 1993-2013 were coded and analyzed. Overall, there was
   a moderate mean effect size of 0.523 for the application of mobile
   devices to education. The effect sizes of moderator variables were
   analyzed and the advantages and disadvantages of mobile learning in
   different levels of moderator variables were synthesized based on
   content analyses of individual studies. The results of this study and
   their implications for both research and practice are discussed. (C)

Title = {Promoting Lasting Change in Teaching Practices Through a Summer
   Immersion Faculty Development Program},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Despite decades of effort, and billions of dollars invested to improve
   engineering education, there is still a lack of knowledge on how to
   transform faculty into users of effective instructional strategies. This
   study concludes that instructional development programs have a good
   potential for promoting lasting change in faculty when the design is
   based on a one-month summer immersion period with a stipend, and when it
   is aligned with all the stakeholder's interests and concerns. After the
   faculty complete one week of workshops, the change process is compelled
   by the preparation of 60 standardized lesson plans for two courses (30
   per course), per participant, plus the requirement that they experiment
   with the new techniques in the classroom. The study is based on N = 27
   faculty members of civil, mechanical, electrical, computer, and
   industrial engineering, and physics. Faculty and student survey results
   identify several successful impacts of the program, including faculty
   adoption of research-based instructional strategies and increased
   faculty and student satisfaction. The success of the program is
   attributed to its incorporation of several best practices suggested by
   the faculty development literature. This article may be very practically
   relevant either to individual instructors who aspire to change their own
   teaching practices, or to Heads of School and Departments who want to
   improve the teaching and learning activities throughout their school as
   a whole, and who could use the description of the program as a suitable
   model to be followed.},

Abstract = {Objective: Pharmaceutical polymer materials science is a new discipline
   that integrates the fields of materials science, polymer chemistry,
   polymer physics and pharmaceutical preparation and it is an
   indispensable part of modern pharmacy. This study aimed to improve the
   quality of teaching pharmaceutical polymer materials science to a class
   of mixed majors. Materials and Methods: We reformed the teaching content
   and methods of the pharmaceutical polymer materials course at Southwest
   University and implemented strategies to enhance exchange between
   teachers and students. In redesigning the teaching content, we made use
   of multiple teaching methods including example-teaching, heuristic
   teaching, problem-based learning, comparative teaching, interactive
   teaching and the flipped classroom. Results: Reforming teaching methods
   improved teaching quality and student interest in the course.
   Conclusion: The reformed teaching program in this study was effective at
   improving student interest, initiative and enthusiasm for learning. The
   strategies used in this reform should be promoted and applied in the
   teaching of other courses.},

Abstract = {This study examined a long-term afterschool leadership program situated
   in a Midwestern university town in the US. The activity-based program
   for boys considered to be disengaged with school and at risk for
   dropping out of education, was based on the Teaching Personal and Social
   Responsibility (TPSR) model. The program curriculum was strongly aligned
   with the social and emotional learning (SEL) theoretical framework. The
   study sought to identify the learning(s) that occurred and the impact of
   participation for participants. The key findings were that 1) the
   pedagogical approach and strategies of TPSR when implemented with a high
   level of fidelity align strongly with the SEL framework; 2) the
   structure and design of this TPSR based program was an important
   ingredient in the school's overall approach to supporting SEL among
   students, and 3) a number of SEL outcomes were identified as a result of
   participation in this program.},

Title = {Initial implementation of active learning strategies in large, lecture
   STEM courses: lessons learned from a multi-institutional,
   interdisciplinary STEM faculty development program},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Background A faculty development program was implemented over four years
   at a 4-year regional comprehensive university and two partnering
   community colleges. This project was focused on improving student
   learning in introductory Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math
   (STEM) courses at each institution, by helping faculty adopt inclusive,
   student-centered pedagogies. Survey data were combined with data from
   classroom videos, faculty interviews, and student questionnaires
   collected during the first two years of the project to give insight into
   how faculty initially implemented the theory and strategies they learned
   and how the students perceived instruction from participating faculty.
   Results These data sources were combined to generate four overall themes
   to characterize our project and guide future projects. These are: (1)
   implementation of student-centered learning took a variety of forms; (2)
   quality implementation of student-centered teaching practices lagged
   behind understanding of the theory behind those practices; (3) the most
   robust perceived barriers to implementation of student-centered teaching
   stayed constant, while more moderate barriers were ranked differently
   from year 1 to year 2; and (4) faculty perceptions of student-centered
   learning practices were not always the same as students' perceptions.
   These themes build from the extant faculty development literature in
   that they are drawn from the unique context of a multidisciplinary,
   multi-institutional project, and that they represent an ``on the
   ground{''} perspective from case studies combined with ``big picture{''}
   findings from surveys. Conclusions This paper describes the faculty
   development project, as well as our collection and interpretation of
   data from surveys and case studies, to ultimately develop the four
   themes. Recommendations deriving from these themes are also described.
   These include modeling a variety of pedagogies; adopting realistic
   expectations for faculty change; institutionalizing faculty development
   so it can take place over multiple years; being transparent with faculty

Title = {Supporting culturally and linguistically diverse students during
   clinical placement: strategies from both sides of the table},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Background: Increasing proportions of Culturally and Linguistically
   Diverse (CALD) students within health professional courses at
   universities creates challenges in delivering inclusive training and
   education. Clinical placements are a core component of most health care
   degrees as they allow for applied learning opportunities. A research gap
   has been identified in regard to understanding challenges and strategies
   for CALD students in health professional placements.
   Methods: A key stakeholder approach was used to examine barriers and
   enablers experienced by CALD students in clinical placement.
   Semi-structured focus groups with healthcare students (n = 13) and
   clinical placement supervisors (n = 12) were employed. The focus groups
   were analysed using open coding and thematic analysis.
   Results: Three main barrier areas were identified: placement planning
   and preparation; teaching, assessment and feedback; and cultural and
   language issues. Potential solutions included addressing placement
   planning and preparation barriers, appropriate student placement
   preparation, pre-placement identification of higher risk CALD students,
   and diversity training for supervisors. For the barrier of teaching,
   assessment \& feedback, addressing strategies were to: adapt student
   caseloads, encourage regular casual supervisor-student conversations,
   develop supportive placement delivery modes and structures, set
   expectations early, model the constructive feedback process, use visual
   aids, and tailor the learning environment to individual student needs.
   The enablers for cultural \& language issues were to: build language and
   practical approaches for communication, raise awareness of the
   healthcare system (how it interacts with healthcare professions and how
   patients access it), and initiate mentoring programs.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that teaching and learning strategies
   should be student-centred, aiming to promote awareness of difference and
   its impacts then develop appropriate responses by both student and
   teacher. Universities and partnering agencies, such as clinical training
   providers, need to provide an inclusive learning environment for
   students from multiple cultural backgrounds.},

Title = {Using Ensemble Learning to Improve Automatic Vectorization of Tensor
   Contraction Program},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {47112-47124},
Abstract = {Automatic vectorization is crucial for improving the performance of
   computationally intensive programs. Existing compilers use conservative
   optimization strategies for automatic vectorization, which, in many
   cases, lead to the loss of vectorization opportunity. Studies have shown
   that the use of machine learning algorithms to build a performance
   prediction model is beneficial to improve the program performance. The
   model input is program features, and the output is the predicted
   optimization strategies or the program performance related to the
   optimization. In this paper, we focus on a computational intensive loop
   structure-tensor contraction, which is common in quantum chemical
   simulations. Most existing machine learning methods rely on control and
   data flow graphs as features to represent programs, but different tensor
   contraction kernels have the same control and data flow graphs. In
   addition, the existing methods often use the same kind of learning
   algorithm to construct a learning model, which is prone to overfitting
   and low-precision problems. In this paper, we propose an automatic
   vectorization performance enhancement method based on ensemble learning.
   We construct an ensemble learning model to predict the performance of
   tensor contraction kernels with different vectorization strategies and
   select the best vectorization strategy for the kernels. According to the
   storage access patterns of the tensor contraction kernels, we propose a
   static method for features representation. Based on the multi-algorithm
   ensemble learning strategy, we obtain better learning results than the
   single learning algorithm. The experimental results show that the
   prediction model achieves 88\% and 87\% prediction efficiency on two
   different platforms with different instruction sets, data types, and
   compilers. Compared with the existing methods, the prediction efficiency
   is greatly improved. In addition, the average peak performance is 2.96x
   of Intel ICC 12.0 and 2.98x of GCC 4.6 compiler, respectively.},

Title = {Combining Learning and Engagement Strategies in a Software Testing
   Learning Environment},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTING EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {There continues to be an increase in enrollments in various computing
   programs at academic institutions due to many job opportunities
   available in the information, communication, and technology sectors.
   This enrollment surge has presented several challenges in many Computer
   Science (CS), Information Technology (IT), and Software Engineering (SE)
   programs at universities and colleges. One such challenge is that many
   instructors in CS/IT/SE programs continue to use learning approaches
   that are not learner centered and therefore are not adequately preparing
   students to be proficient in the ever-changing computing industry. To
   mitigate this challenge, instructors need to use evidence-based
   pedagogical approaches, e.g., active learning, to improve student
   learning and engagement in the classroom and equip students with the
   skills necessary to be lifelong learners.
   This article presents an approach that combines learning and engagement
   strategies (LESs) in learning environments using different teaching
   modalities to improve student learning and engagement. We describe how
   LESs are integrated into face-to-face (F2F) and online class activities.
   The LESs currently used are collaborative learning, gamification,
   problem-based learning, and social interaction. We describe an approach
   used to quantify each LES used during class activities based on a set of
   characteristics for LESs and the traditional lecture-style pedagogical
   approaches. To demonstrate the impact of using LESs in F2F class
   activities, we report on a study conducted over seven semesters in a
   software testing class at a large urban minority serving institution.
   The study uses a posttest-only study design, the scores of two midterm
   exams, and approximate class times dedicated to each LES and traditional
   lecture style to quantify their usage in a face-to-face software testing
   class. The study results showed that increasing the time dedicated to
   collaborative learning, gamification, and social interaction and
   decreasing the traditional lecture-style approach resulted in a
   statistically significant improvement in student learning, as reflected
   in the exam scores.},

Title = {Coping Strategies of Failing International Medical Students in Two
   Chinese Universities: A Qualitative Study},
Journal = {TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 15},
Abstract = {Phenomenon: China hosts a large number of international medical students
   from low-income countries, and some fail examinations in the early stage
   of the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) program.
   Little is known about how failing international medical students cope to
   recover their academic performance. It would be beneficial to
   investigate the coping strategies they use to help them recover their
   academic performance and progress. Approach: Semi-structured interviews
   were conducted with 21 international medical students at two
   universities in China from September 2020 to January 2021. These
   students had passed make-up exams or re-sits and progressed
   academically. A thematic analysis approach was used to identify major
   themes in the interview data. Findings: After failing initial exams or
   re-sits, students were found to adopt seven coping strategies to help
   them pass future examinations and recover their academic performance:
   (i) increased help-seeking behaviors, (ii) improved learning motivation
   and attitudes, (iii) improved learning strategies, (iv) improved exam
   preparation, (v) utilization of library resources, (vi) enhanced time
   management, and (vii) enhanced English language skills. Of the seven
   strategies, seeking help from friends, peers, seniors, and teachers was
   the strategy reported most frequently. Insights: The results of this
   study provide insights into the coping strategies that international
   undergraduate medical students adopt to recover from poor academic
   performance in Chinese universities. Host institutions should recognize
   the resilience and agency of such students to make positive changes.
   Furthermore, institutional efforts should be made to develop
   contextualized intervention plans that stimulate students' learning
   motivation and encourage them to adopt self-help strategies by
   incorporating useful resources (e.g., help from peers, seniors, and
   teachers). Enrollment should integrate specific English language
   proficiency criteria, and interviews and entrance exams should be
   conducted. For some failing students, it may be necessary to provide
   academic remediation.},

Title = {Learning Style Integrated Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for
   Programming Problem Recommendation in Online Judge System},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Exercise recommendation is an integral part of enabling personalized
   learning. Giving appropriate exercises can facilitate learning for
   learners. The programming problem recommendation is a specific
   application of the exercise recommendation. Therefore, an innovative
   recommendation framework for programming problems that integrate
   learners' learning styles is proposed. In addition, there are some
   difficulties to be solved in this framework, such as quantifying
   learning behavior, representing programming problems, and quantifying
   learning strategies. For the difficulties in quantifying learning
   behavior and quantifying learning strategies, a programming problem
   recommendation algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRLP) is
   proposed. DRLP includes the specific design of action space,
   action-value Q-network, and reward function. Learning style is embedded
   into DRLP through action space to make recommendations more
   personalized. To represent the programming problem in DRLP, a
   multi-dimensional integrated programming problem representation model is
   proposed to quantify the difficulty feature, knowledge point feature,
   text description, input description, and output description of
   programming problems. In particular, Bi-GRU is introduced to learn
   texts' contextual semantic association information from both positive
   and negative directions. Finally, a simulation experiment is carried out
   with the actual learning behavior data of 47,147 learners in the LUOGU
   Online Judge system. Compared with the optimal baseline model, the
   recommendation effect of DRLP has improved (HR, MRR, and Novelty have
   increased by 4.35\%, 1.15\%, and 1.1\%), which proves the rationality of
   the programming problem representation model and action-value Q-network.},

   Program of Assessment: Strategies, Outcomes and Lessons Learned},

Abstract = {Problem: Development of a novel, competency-based program of assessment
   requires creation of a plan to measure the processes that enable
   successful implementation. The principles of implementation science
   outline the importance of considering key drivers that support and
   sustain transformative change within an educational program. The
   introduction of Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) as a
   framework for assessment has underscored the need to create a structured
   plan to prepare assessors to engage in a new paradigm of assessment.
   Although approaches to rater training for workplace-based assessments
   have been described, specific strategies to prepare assessors to apply
   standards related to the level of supervision a student needs have not
   been documented. Intervention: We describe our systematic approach to
   prepare assessors, faculty and postgraduate trainees, to complete EPA
   assessments for medical students during the clerkship phase of our
   curriculum. This institution-wide program is designed to build
   assessors' skills in direct observation of learners during authentic
   patient encounters. Assessors apply new knowledge and practice skills in
   using established performance expectations to determine the level of
   supervision a learner needs to perform clinical tasks. Assessors also
   learn to provide feedback and narrative comments to coach students and
   promote their ongoing clinical development. Data visualizations for
   assessors facilitate reinforcement of the tenets learned during
   training. Collaborative learning and peer feedback during faculty
   development sessions promote the formation of a community of practice
   among assessors. Context: Faculty development for assessors was
   implemented in advance of implementation of the EPA program. Assessors
   in the program include residents/fellows who work closely with students,
   faculty with discipline-specific expertise and a group of experienced
   clinicians who were selected to serve as experts in competency-based EPA
   assessments, the Master Assessors. Training focused on creating a shared
   understanding about the application of criteria used to evaluate student
   performance. EPA assessments based on the AAMC's Core Entrustable
   Professional Activities for Entering Residency, were completed in nine
   core clerkships. EPA assessments included a supervision rating based on
   a modified scale for use in undergraduate medical education. Impact:
   Data from EPA assessments completed during the first year of the program
   were analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the faculty development
   activities implemented to prepare assessors to consistently apply
   standards for assessment. A systematic approach to training and
   attention to critical drivers that enabled institution-wide
   implementation, led to consistency in the supervision rating for
   students' first EPA assessment completed by any type of assessor,
   ratings by assessors done within a specific clinical context, and
   ratings assigned by a group of specific assessors across clinical
   settings. Lessons learned: A systematic approach to faculty development
   with a willingness to be flexible and reach potential participants using
   existing infrastructure, can facilitate assessors' engagement in a new
   culture of assessment. Interaction among participants during training
   sessions not only promotes learning but also contributes to community
   building. A leadership group responsible to oversee faculty development
   can ensure that the needs of stakeholders are addressed and that a
   change in assessment culture is sustained.},

Abstract = {This study investigated how 35 Chinese university instructors developed
   and engaged in critical reflections in a six-month Problem-Based
   Learning (PBL) professional learning program in Denmark. Data sources
   included individual progressive portfolios, team-project reports, and
   focus group interview. Quantitative analysis indicated that participants
   developed significantly in content, process, and premise reflection in
   the domains of instructional knowledge and pedagogical knowledge. This
   result provides evidence for the effectiveness of using a PBL
   methodology to organize professional learning activities aiming for the
   development of critical reflection for transformative learning.
   Nevertheless, participants demonstrated little premise reflection
   regarding curricular knowledge, an area that demands more time and more
   systemic support. Qualitative analysis identified systemic, individual,
   and cultural factors constraining engineering teachers from critical
   reflection. The study also suggests that to facilitate premise
   reflection it takes longer than six months and demands more systemic
   support.},

Abstract = {The educational literature generally suggests that supplemental
   instruction (SI) is effective in improving academic performance in
   traditionally difficult courses. A pilot program of peer teaching based
   on the SI model was implemented for an undergraduate course in human
   anatomy. Students in the course were stratified into three groups based
   on the number of peer teaching sessions they attended: nonattendees (0
   sessions), infrequently attended (1-3 sessions), and frequently attended
   ( 4 sessions). After controlling for academic preparedness {[}i.e.,
   admission grade point average (AGPA)] using an analysis of covariance,
   the final grades of frequent attendees were significantly higher than
   those of nonattendees (P=0.025) and infrequent attendees (P=0.015). A
   multiple regression analysis was performed to estimate the relative
   independent contribution of several variables in predicting the final
   grade. The results suggest that frequent attendance (=0.245, P=0.007)
   and AGPA (=0.555, P<0.001) were significant positive predictors, while
   being a first-year student (=-0.217, P=0.006) was a significant negative
   predictor. Collectively, these results suggest that attending a certain
   number of sessions may be required to gain a noticeable benefit from the
   program, and that first-year students (particularly those with a lower
   level of academic preparedness) would likely stand to benefit from
   maximally using the program. End-of-semester surveys and reports
   indicate that the program had several additional benefits, both to the
   students taking the course and to the students who served as program
   leaders. Anat Sci Educ 9: 132-142. (c) 2015 The Authors. Anatomical

Title = {FTS-SOCI: An agent-based framework for simulating teaching strategies
   with evolutions of sociograms},

Abstract = {Teaching strategies have been proven to influence the academic
   performance of students, as well as group sociometrics have been proven
   to be directly related to group performance. Although in the literature
   there are examples of teaching strategies and the resulting sociograms,
   there is not any detailed technique, tool or simulator that predicts the
   influence of a new teaching strategy on group sociometrics. The current
   work is aimed at covering this gap in the literature, by providing a
   framework for programming teaching strategies to simulate their
   influence on group sociometrics. In particular, this framework is called
   FTS-SOCI (Framework for simulating Teaching Strategies with evolutions
   of SOCIograms). This framework includes an agent-based simulator that
   simulates the evolution of sociograms taking five models of the
   literature into account. In this framework, students and teacher are
   modelled as agents, and the teacher agent can have any teaching strategy
   defined by the user. In order to test the current approach, this work
   simulates existing teaching strategies in (1) nursing education and (2)
   sport lessons. The resulting sociograms of FTS-SOCI for these strategies
   have been compared with the corresponding real sociograms reported in
   the literature. This works shows that the group sociometric values
   provided by FTS-SOCI are quite similar to the real cases. For instance,
   the mean squared error of the group cohesion sociometric (i.e. IAg
   metric) is only 0.00024 and 0.00068 respectively for the teaching
   strategies of both fields. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A Tale of Four Programs: How Residents Learn About Quality Improvement
   during Postgraduate Medical Education at the University of Calgary},

Abstract = {Phenomenon: Quality Improvement (QI) has become increasingly
   incorporated into competency frameworks for physician learners over the
   past two decades. As contemporary medical education adapts
   competency-based models of training, learners will be required to
   demonstrate competency in QI. There is a need to explore how various
   residency programs are currently teaching QI, including how residents
   might participate in experiential QI activities, and the various
   outcomes of these strategies. Approach: A collective case study examined
   how residents in four postgraduate programs at a single academic
   institution have learned about QI since the formal integration of QI as
   a cross-cutting competency. Data from surveys, interviews, observations,
   and archival records were collected in order to develop a comprehensive
   understanding of each case in its real-life context and explore current
   and historical trends and patterns within and across the four programs.
   Findings: Teaching and resident involvement in QI projects increased
   across all four programs since its formal integration into the national
   physician competency framework. Two programs had a longitudinal, hybrid
   QI curriculum involving didactic and experiential components. Two
   programs had didactic-alone QI curricula, with minimal resident
   engagement in applied QI activities. Between-program differences were
   quantified with regards to learning climate, safety climate, QI
   knowledge, skills, and attitudes, attitudes toward research during
   residency, and quality of mentorship for scholarly activities. Residents
   in programs with experiential learning reported higher knowledge,
   skills, and attitudes toward QI were motivated to lead improvement
   efforts in their future practice. Residents in programs with
   didactic-only QI teaching perceived that the historical
   operationalization of the scholarly project as research was a barrier to
   their involvement in QI, as it was not valued or legitimized in their
   academic and clinical contexts. Common barriers and facilitators to
   engagement with QI across all programs included time, mentorship,
   motivation, and competing demands such as feeling pressure to conduct
   research in order to obtain competitive fellowship positions or
   employment. Common across all programs was the perception of the
   residency scholarly project requirement as a ``checkbox.{''}
   Associations were quantified between the constructs of learning climate
   with safety culture, and safety culture with QI knowledge, skills, and
   attitudes. Insights: While hybrid QI curricula with experiential
   learning remains an effective curriculum strategy, tensions between
   research and QI may be a critical barrier to learner engagement in
   experiential activities. In addition to providing learners with support,
   time, mentorship, and explicitly communicating the value QI by the
   program, the local safety culture may impact QI learning beyond the core
   curriculum. Reconceptualization of the scholarly project requirements to
   normalize QI activities and recognizing the potential influence of the
   local organizational culture on QI learning and how trainees can
   positively or negatively shape these cultures warrants consideration.},

Title = {Bringing Synchrony and Clarity to Complex Multi-Channel Data: A Learning
   Analytics Study in Programming Education},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {166531-166541},
Abstract = {Supporting teaching and learning programming with learning analytics is
   an active area of inquiry. Most data used for learning analytics
   research comes from learning management systems. However, such systems
   were not developed to support learning programming. Therefore, educators
   have to resort to other systems that support the programming process,
   which can pose a challenge when it comes to understanding students'
   learning since it takes place in different contexts. Methods that
   support the combination of different data sources are needed. Such
   methods would ideally account for the time-ordered sequence of students'
   learning actions. In this article, we use a novel method (multi-channel
   sequence mining with Hidden Markov Models, HMMs) that allows the
   combination of multiple data sources, accounts for the temporal nature
   of students' learning actions, and maps the transitions between
   different learning tactics. Our study included 291 students enrolled in
   a higher education programming course. Students' trace-log data were
   collected from the learning management system and from a programming
   automated assessment tool. Data were analyzed using multi-channel
   sequence mining and HMM. The results reveal different patterns of
   students' approaches to learning programming. High achievers start
   earlier to work on the programming assignments, use more independent
   strategies and consume learning resources more frequently, while the low
   achievers procrastinate early in the course and rely on help forums. Our
   findings demonstrate the potentials of multi-channel sequence mining and
   how this method can be analyzed using HMM. Furthermore, the results
   obtained can be of use for educators to understand students' strategies
   when learning programming.},

Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {BackgroundIncreasingly, non-English speaking countries use English as
   the medium of instruction (EMI) to teach academic subjects. This study
   investigated the challenges and adaptation strategies of teachers and
   students in an EMI medical education program in China.MethodsData were
   collected on EMI and non-EMI students' test performances and student and
   teacher perceptions of the program. Test scores and survey results were
   analyzed using SPSS. Focus group transcripts and open-ended comments
   from surveys were examined using thematic coding.ResultsThere were no
   significant differences in admission and graduation test scores for EMI
   and non-EMI students. Four challenges with the EMI program were
   identified: (1) insufficient/inappropriate teaching materials, (2)
   unsatisfactory teaching, (3) inadequate class interactions, and (4)
   failure to teach medical humanities. To address these challenges,
   teachers and students used adaptive strategies, such as the use of
   alternative textbooks, self-learning skills and Chinese
   language.ConclusionsEMI programs are difficult to initiate, requiring
   faculty development and institutional support, and student self and peer
   group learning strategies to be successful. The adaptive strategies
   employed by both students and teachers offer insights into how other EMI
   programs might strengthen their implementation.},

Abstract = {To lead positive change in the teaching practice of teams that service
   large numbers of diverse students from multiple degree programs provides
   many challenges. The primary aim of this study was to provide a clear
   framework on which to plan the process of change that can be utilized by
   academic departments sector wide. Barriers to change were reduced by
   adapting and utilizing Kotter's principals of change specifically by
   creating a sense of urgency and defining a clear goal designed to
   address the problem. Changing attitudes involved training staff in new
   teaching and learning approaches and strategies, and creating a
   collaborative, supportive team-based teaching environment within which
   the planned changes could be implemented and evaluated. As a result
   senior academics are now directly involved in delivering sections of the
   face-to-face teaching in the new environment. Through promoting positive
   change we enabled deeper student engagement with the theoretical
   concepts delivered in lectures as evidenced by favorable student
   evaluations, feedback, and improved final exam results. A collaborative
   team-based approach that recognizes the importance of distributed
   leadership combined with a clearly articulated change management process
   were central to enabling academics to design, try, and evaluate the new
   teaching and learning practices. Our study demonstrates that a concerted
   focus on change management enabled teaching team members to adopt a
   major shift in the teaching and learning approach that resulted in
   measurable improvements in student learning. (c) 2015 by The

Abstract = {In professional training programs, how to help learners fully understand
   the contexts and problem-solving procedure in the workplace is a crucial
   and challenging issue. Due to the advancements of computer and
   multimedia technology, many professional training programs have applied
   technology to provide richer learning content. Blended learning is a
   learning approach combining online and physical courses. In the blended
   learning mode, learners can not only learn through multimedia teaching
   materials, but also interact and practice with teachers and students in
   online and physical classrooms. However, the conventional blended
   learning (C-BL) mode mainly presents teaching content through online
   videos and physical courses. In such a learning environment with one-way
   information transmission and without experience, it is not easy for most
   learners to experience the actual situations encountered in the
   professional training process, which affects their judgment and actual
   handling performance. In order to tackle this problem, this research
   adopted spherical video-based virtual reality (SVVR) technology and
   applied it in a general registered nurse (RN) training program via a
   blended learning mode. To verify the effects of this teaching approach,
   a quasi-experimental study was conducted in a RN training program in a
   large-scale hospital. The experimental group employed the SVVR-BL mode
   while the control group employed the C-BL mode. The results indicated
   that the SVVR-BL mode could not only improve learners' learning
   achievement, but also enhance their problem-solving tendency,
   metacognition tendency, and classroom engagement. The practical skills
   test results in the workplace further implied that, compared to the
   learners who adopted the C-BL mode, learners who adopted the SVVR-BL
   mode had better judgment, analysis, and overall performance of the
   handling process when encountering practical problems. As a result,
   SVVR-BL not only helped learners gain knowledge and improve their higher
   order thinking, but also assisted them in applying what they had learned
   to solve real problems. This result can serve as an important reference
   for SVVR-BL studies and the design of professional training programs in
   the future.},

Title = {Learning strategies used by undergraduate nursing students in the
   context of a digitial educational strategy based on script concordance:
   A descriptive study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},

Abstract = {Background: the digital educational strategy based on script concordance
   is an educational method that has been attracting increasing attention
   in healthcare education programs to fostering the development of
   clinical reasoning. It includes a digitized Script Concordance Test with
   incorporated expert feedback. However, the learning strategies required
   of students in the context of its use remain unknown.
   Objective: This study aimed to identify the learning strategies that
   undergraduate nursing students need to use in the context of the digital
   educational strategy based on script concordance.
   Method: A qualitative descriptive design was used to identify student
   learning strategies. Data was collected using an online questionnaire
   and semi-directed focus group interviews. Begin's taxonomy provided the
   framework for linking the data collected to learning strategies required
   of students.
   Results: Forty-four students participated in the study. Results show
   that when using a digital educational strategy based on script
   concordance, students are called to rely on their nascent scripts in
   order to select the data in short ill-defined clinical vignettes,
   evaluate new information repeatedly, anticipate microjudgments, and
   thus, gradually increase their knowledge and refine their scripts.
   Viewing the experts' feedback and consulting the referencing tools
   helped students self-monitor their knowledge, a key metacognitive
   strategy to learning clinical reasoning. Completed individually or with
   peers, the digital educational strategy could be used to learn a
   particular concept or as an integrative activity before an evaluation.
   Conclusion: This original study has allowed us to link nursing clinical
   reasoning teaching conditions to the learning strategies used to develop
   this competency. Study results inform instructors about digital
   educational strategy based on script concordance to make it
   complementary with other educational strategies to better support
   complex learning of nursing clinical reasoning.},

Abstract = {Physical education programs in colleges/universities have been called on
   to provide students with opportunities to develop an appreciation for,
   and increase participation in, lifetime physical activity. Higher
   Education Physical Activity Programs (HEPAPs) have evolved over the past
   100 years in response to changing societal and institutional
   expectations. The purpose of this article is to celebrate the long
   history of HEPAPs and recommend innovative strategies for program
   development that will maintain their position as a valued aspect of
   campus life. After tracing the historical roots and trends of HEPAPs,
   the authors suggest (a) adopting a public health perspective, (b)
   applying theoretical models as a framework for program development, (c)
   focusing on meaningful learner engagement, and (d) employing
   learner-centered instructional approaches. Within these overall themes,
   specific recommendations for program improvement are provided, including
   the use of alternative content areas, model-based instruction, universal
   design, instructional technology, and professional development for
   faculty/staff.},

Abstract = {Active Methodologies allow an active process in teaching and learning
   contents, promote responsible student involvement and bring satisfaction
   and enrichment to educational practices and active learning. Generally,
   students have learning difficulties in Computer Science courses, as they
   need to develop computational skills and thinking. The goals of this
   article is to characterize and analyze the types of Active Methodologies
   that are being applied in teaching and learning activities in Computer
   Science. Thus, this investigation was carried out through a Systematic
   Mapping Study, focusing on the use of the types of methodologies in view
   of the results achieved. It presents students' perceptions, benefits,
   and difficulties in adopting these methodologies in the classroom. The
   results show 6 types of different Active Methodologies used in 35
   publications selected, different types of techniques or studies that
   were used, the publications trend per year, the courses that were worked
   in analyzed publications, and some benefits and difficulty related to
   the adoption of Active Methodologies. Regarding to students' perception,
   we identified different type feelings. Thus, the contributions of this
   study consist in a research focused on the use of Active Methodologies
   in a very broad sense, including the perceptions of teachers and
   students regarding the use of different teaching and learning
   methodologies. In addition, it shows the specific benefits and possible
   difficulties experienced in the use of Active Methodologies as teaching
   strategies. Consequently, some findings from this study may have the
   potential to support or direct choices of these methodologies in
   different Computer Science courses.},

Title = {Teaching Programming by Revealing Thinking Process: Watching Experts'
   Live Coding Videos With Reflection Annotations},

Abstract = {Contribution: Programming is a complex cognitive activity that involves
   both conceptual understanding and procedural skills, which is
   challenging for novices. To develop both program comprehension and
   implementation competency, this study proposed a live-coding-based
   instruction. Experts' live coding with think-aloud was recorded.
   Students then learn algorithmic planning and coding skills by observing
   experts' thinking and coding processes from the videos. To deploy this
   pedagogical strategy, a learning platform was developed to present the
   videos to students who could also annotate their reflection about the
   videos in the system to deepen their understanding of syntax and
   concepts of computer programming. Background: Traditional lecture-based
   programming instruction focuses more on the explanation of syntax and
   concepts but lacks revealing the dynamic and nonlinear thinking and
   coding process. Research Questions: This study is to explore the effects
   of live-coding-based instruction on students' programming knowledge,
   including declarative program knowledge (program comprehension) and
   procedural program knowledge (coding skills), and whether the
   instruction changes their attitude toward programming learning or not.
   Methodology: An empirical study was conducted with 33 high-school
   students who were novice programmers in one semester to explore the
   effectiveness of the live-coding-based instruction and the use of the
   learning platform. Findings: The experiment results show that watching
   flowcharting (r=0.369, p <0.05) or coding processes (r=0.409, p <0.05)
   of experts improves coding skills. This implies that explicit depiction
   of algorithmic planning and coding processes are essential for building
   procedural programming knowledge. In addition, reflection on syntactic
   content of experts' programming plays an important role in programming
   (r=0.511,p <0.01). The research findings suggest that programming
   instruction could focus more on developing students' problem-solving
   abilities by demonstrating the dynamic and nonlinear programming
   processes and providing opportunities for students to reflect on how
   syntactic knowledge could be applied to programming.},

Abstract = {Clinical education is foundational to health professional training.
   However, it is also a time of increased stress for students. A student's
   perception of stressors and their capacity to effectively manage them is
   a legitimate concern for educators, because anxiety and decreased coping
   strategies can interfere with effective learning, clinical performance
   and capacity to care for patients. Resilience is emerging as a valuable
   construct to underpin positive coping strategies for learning and
   professional practice. We report the development and evaluation of a
   psycho-education resilience program designed to build practical
   skills-based resilience capacities in health science (physiotherapy)
   students. Six final year undergraduate physiotherapy students attended
   four action research sessions led by a clinical health psychologist.
   Resilience strategies drawn from cognitive behavioural therapy, and
   positive and performance psychology were introduced. Students identified
   personal learning stressors and their beliefs and responses. They chose
   specific resilience-based strategies to address them, and then reported
   their impact on learning performance and experiences. Thematic analysis
   of the audio-recorded and transcribed action research sessions, and
   students' de identified notes was conducted. Students' initial
   descriptions of stressors as `problems' outside their control resulting
   in poor thinking and communication, low confidence and frustration,
   changed to a focus on how they managed and recognized learning
   challenges as normal or at least expected elements of the clinical
   learning environment. The research suggests that replacing stressful
   challenges with positive coping strategies offers a potentially powerful
   tool to build self-efficacy and cognitive control as well as greater
   self-awareness as a learner and future health practitioner.},

Abstract = {Success of e-learning systems depends on their capability to
   automatically retrieve and recommend relevant learning content according
   to the preferences of a specific learner. Learning experience and
   dynamic choice of educational material that is presented to learners can
   be enhanced using different recommendation techniques. As popularity of
   collaborative tagging systems grows, users' tags could provide useful
   information to improve recommender system algorithms in e-learning
   environments. In this paper, we present an approach for implementation
   of collaborative tagging techniques into online tutoring system. The
   implemented approach combines social tagging and sequential patterns
   mining for generating recommendations of learning resources to learners.
   Several experiments were carried out in order to verify usability of the
   proposed hybrid method within e-learning environment and analyze
   selected social tagging techniques.},

Title = {Role of Cooperative Programs in the University-to-Career Transition: A
   Case Study in Construction Management Engineering Education},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},

Abstract = {With the recent economic and technological rapid change, a major shift
   in the workforce nature is expected shortly. Construction management is
   currently focused on increasing productivity and optimizing structures
   costs. However, new management strategies rely on quality management,
   global manufacturing, building information modeling, and many others.
   Those new strategies require managers with soft skills and can operate
   in situations. With that in mind, cooperative education (Co-op) has a
   pivotal role in formulating the relationship between the universities
   and industry for better reflecting on the recently needed industrial
   requirements in curriculum content. In this paper, the role of the Co-op
   programs in university-to-career transition has been explored through a
   case study of the engineering management students of Prince Sultan
   University (Riyadh, KSA). Direct and Indirect assessment studies were
   performed to investigate the nature of the Co-op programs offered to the
   five student batches (2015-2019) of the Construction Management program
   (CMP), the students' gained experiences upon completion of the Co-op,
   the program's overall quality and efficiency, and the Co-op students'
   readiness to start their career. The 5A's indicators model has been used
   for the indirect assessment, while the SEF direct assessment tool was
   proposed to evaluate the student learning outcomes achieved by the end
   of the program, considering the evaluation of Employers, Faculty, and
   the students' self-assessment. The assessment results showed that the
   real-life experiences gained by Co-op students improved their job
   readiness. It also increased their chances of getting a job even before
   graduation. The study found that 70\% of PSU construction management
   Co-op students got jobs through the Co-op. Nevertheless, the study also
   addressed several weak points associated with the offered Co-op, such as
   the unreliability of the employers' evaluation and ignoring the student
   self-assessment in the currently utilized direct assessment method.},

Title = {Do teaching strategies matter? Relationships between various teaching
   strategies and medical students' wellbeing during clinical workplace
   training},

Abstract = {Introduction: In the later years of medical school, medical students
   learn through clinical rotations at medical institutions. Using
   cognitive apprenticeships as the theoretical reference for teaching
   strategies, this study aimed to assess how clinical teaching strategies
   benefit medical students' wellbeing in the workplace. Methods: Our
   target population comprised two cohorts of medical students in the
   seventh year of a 7-year medical education program in Taiwan, undergoing
   clinical training at a tertiary medical center between August 2012 and
   May 2014. After informed consent was obtained, participants were
   regularly mailed a validated, structured, and self-administered
   questionnaire to evaluate their clinical teachers' teaching strategies
   and their personal wellbeing at the end of individual specialty
   rotations, and medical students' were freely permitted to respond to
   each invitation. Eighty-seven medical students returned 1364 responses,
   which were included in the structural equation modeling. Results: We
   determined that the Inspiring teaching strategy, characterized by
   articulation, reflection, and exploration, was related to reduced
   burnout among medical students and an increased sense of compassion
   satisfaction; the Directing teaching strategy, characterized by
   modeling, coaching, and scaffolding, was related only to reduced burnout
   among medical students but not to compassion satisfaction during the
   clinical training. Conclusions: Clinical teaching strategies were
   demonstrated to affect, to various extents, medical students' wellbeing
   with respect to factors such as burnout and compassion satisfaction in
   the workplace. Clinical teachers and educators should increase efforts
   to develop Inspiring teaching skills to shift the balance of
   responsibility and to support students in the teaching and learning
   relationship.},

Abstract = {This practical report analyzes a programming class using a micro robot
   (MR), the smallest soccer robot in the RoboCup world competition. This
   class examined the effect of using the MR as the actual equipment
   employed in programming. Questionnaire results on this class revealed
   that these teaching materials evoked a heightened programming interest
   among students. Moreover, the problems related to programming
   instruction using an MR were better understood; therefore, a strategy
   for improving the related problems is discussed here. (c) 2013 Wiley

Title = {Effect of different mind mapping approaches on primary school students'
   computational thinking skills during visual programming learning},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {181},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) skills help students both understand and
   utilize computing in various domains to cope with the challenges posed
   by the complex digital world. This study applied mind mapping to
   programming language instruction in a primary school, and explored the
   effects of mind mapping on students' CT skills when learning programming
   with Scratch as a programming tool. Two types of mind mapping,
   construct-by-self mind mapping (CBS-MM) and construct-on-scaffold mind
   mapping (COS-MM), were proposed to compare which type is more effective
   in terms of students' CT skills. Seventy-three public primary school
   fifth-grade students aged 10 to 11 participated in the study. The CBS
   group included 33 students learning with the CBS-MM instructional
   approach, while the COS group comprised 40 students learning with the
   COS-MM instructional approach. Data were obtained from nine topic
   Scratch programming assignments and pre-and post-CT skills surveys
   completed by the two groups. Paired sample t tests were used to analyze
   whether the two types of mind mapping approach could improve both
   groups' CT skills. One-way ANCOVA and one-way ANOVA were used to examine
   the difference in the two groups' CT skills. The results showed that
   both CBS-MM and COS-MM can improve students' CT skills; however, the COS
   group students could better improve their CT skills with the assistance
   of the COS-MM method compared with the CBS group students who learned
   with the CBS-MM method. The findings of this study can provide some
   enlightenment for relevant instructors to design instruction and
   implement programming teaching with different kinds of mind mapping
   support that facilitates students' CT.},

Title = {Web-based experiential learning strategies to enhance the
   evidence-basedpractice competence of undergraduate nursing students},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {91},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: Evidence-based practice (EBP) is considered a key competence
   for practicing high-quality and safe nursing. However, undergraduate
   nursing programs continue to provide traditional classroom teaching
   strategies that have limitations in facilitating the development of
   critical competences for engaging in EBP in real clinical contexts.
   Objective and design: The purpose of this study was to develop a
   web-based experiential learning program aimed at improving the
   engagement and experience of nursing students in EBP. A
   quasi-experimental research with non-equivalent control-group with
   non-synchronized design was used to describe the process of program
   development and the innovative learning method, and discuss the outcomes
   of the program.
   Methods: The experimental group was exposed to a web-based experiential
   learning program, while the control group received traditional learning
   with written material. Self-reported EBP scores (knowledge and skills,
   attitude, and practice) and clinical-questioning confidence were
   evaluated to assess the effects of the program.
   Results: The result showed that web-based experiential learning
   strategies were effective in significantly improving the EBP knowledge
   and skills score (F = 12.29, p = .001) and the score for confidence in
   asking clinical questions (F = 12.14, p = .001). The attitudes toward
   EBP (F = 0.75, p = .389) and practice score (F = 3.22, p = .076) did not
   show a significant difference between the experimental group and the
   control group.
   Conclusion: The web-based experiential learning was found to be an
   effective method for enhancing the EBP competence of nursing students.
   Based on the study results, we suggest using web-based experiential
   learning to supplement the traditional learning method or as the
   mainstream learning method for nursing students.},

Title = {Self-Observation and Peer Feedback as a Faculty Development Approach for
   Problem-Based Learning Tutors: A Program Evaluation},
Journal = {TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {313-325},
Abstract = {Problem: Good teaching requires spontaneous, immediate, and appropriate
   action in response to various situations. It is even more crucial in
   problem-based learning (PBL) tutorials, as the tutors, while directing
   students toward the identification and attainment of learning
   objectives, must stimulate them to contribute to the process and provide
   them with constructive feedback. PBL tutors in medicine lack
   opportunities to receive feedback from their peers on their teaching
   strategies. Moreover, as tutorials provide little or no time to stop and
   think, more could be learned by reflecting on the experience than from
   the experience itself. We designed and evaluated a faculty development
   approach to developing PBL tutors that combined self-reflection and peer
   feedback processes, both powerful techniques for improving performance
   in education. Intervention: We developed an observation instrument for
   PBL facilitation to be used both by tutors to self-observe and reflect
   on own teaching strategies and by peers to observe and provide feedback
   to tutors. Twenty PBL sessions were video-recorded. Tutors completed the
   instrument immediately after their PBL session and again while watching
   their video-recorded session (self-observation). A group of three
   observers completed the instrument while watching each recorded session
   and provided feedback to each tutor (peer observation and feedback). We
   investigated tutors' perceptions of the feasibility and acceptability of
   the approach and gathered data on its effectiveness in enhancing tutors'
   facilitation skills. Context: The preclinical medical curriculum at the
   University of Geneva is essentially taught by PBL. A new program of
   faculty development based on self-observation and peer feedback was
   offered to voluntary tutors and evaluated. Outcome: Our results suggest
   that self-observation and peer feedback, supported by an instrument, can
   be effective in enhancing tutors' facilitation skills. Reflection on
   self-observation raised teachers' awareness of the effectiveness of the
   strategies they used to foster student learning. This motivated a need
   to change their teaching practice. However, for the changes to become
   operative, peer feedback was required, providing the cues and strategies
   needed to improve the facilitation skills. Lessons Learned: Peer
   coaching was considered feasible and useful to improve tutors'
   facilitation skills. Evaluating the program made it possible to assess
   tutors' needs and the reasons underlying their difficulties, and this in
   turn provided the basis for advanced workshops. Nonetheless, aspects
   related to logistics and the time constraints of such an individualized
   approach, as well as the cultural appropriation of peer coaching, might
   be obstacles that need to be addressed.},

Abstract = {Phenomenon: Teaching is an important part of the tri-partite mission of
   every medical center. Although teaching often is given lower priority
   and recognition as opposed to patient care and/or research, this
   activity for many physicians in academic medicine ranks second to their
   patient care responsibilities. Medical teacher training has
   traditionally been aimed at faculty and residents through faculty
   development initiatives, continuing education for physicians at
   professional conferences, formalized degree or certificate programs in
   education, and residents as teachers programs. More recently medical
   schools have developed medical-students-as-teachers programs, often
   offered as 4th-year electives, to introduce learners to the theory of
   teaching and learning with appropriate application in the clinical
   setting. Data on learner outcomes and students' perceptions and
   experiences in these programs consist mostly of their satisfaction after
   completing such a program. In this article we explore 4th-year medical
   student trainees' experiences and emerging self-concepts as educators
   during a teaching elective. Approach: The purpose of this project was to
   explore students' reflections on their experiences in a 4th-year medical
   students-as-teachers course in their own words through their written
   self-assessment narratives. We used qualitative content analysis to
   examine 96 trainees' self-reported, written reflective narratives of how
   they translated their students-as-teachers course experience into
   application by applying newly learned educational theories,
   instructional strategies, and feedback skills while teaching novice
   peers physical diagnosis skills. Findings: Narratives revealed candid
   self-assessments and detailed descriptions of their experiences and what
   they valued most from the course. Content analysis revealed nine key
   themes: using teaching strategies for adult learning, preparing for
   class, modeling professionalism, incorporating clinical correlations,
   exceeding course requirements, giving and receiving feedback, providing
   mentoring, creating a positive learning climate, and growing as
   educators. Insights: This study's results reveal how learners perceive
   and translate their experiences in a teaching course, in terms of
   incorporating particular knowledge or skills, valuing or displaying
   certain professional behaviors, and gaining self-awareness and
   satisfaction from teaching experiences. The findings of this study,
   specifically major themes from self-assessment narratives, provide us
   with a better understanding of medical students' developing identities
   and emerging professional self-concept as educators, specifically as
   experienced through a combination of formal teaching, and applying
   education theories and strategies. Findings may be informative from a
   program evaluation lens but also for faculty development initiatives
   related to training medical teachers and the larger landscape of the
   emerging field of Health Professions Education.},

Title = {The influences of a two-tier test strategy on student learning: A lag
   sequential analysis approach},

Abstract = {Recently, programming skills have become a core competence. Many
   teaching strategies were developed to improve programming skills. Among
   them, online tests were widely applied to enhance students learning.
   Nonetheless, they may not be able to engage students in deep thinking
   and reflections. Thus, a two-tier test strategy was proposed to address
   this issue. However, previous research mainly focused on investigating
   the effectiveness of the two-tier test strategy but there is a lack of
   studies that investigate why the two-tier test approach is effective. To
   this end, we developed an online test, where the two-tier test strategy
   was implemented. Additionally, an empirical study was conducted to
   explore the influences of the two-tier test approach on students'
   learning performance and behavior patterns. Pre-test and post-test
   scores were applied to assess students' learning performance while a lag
   sequential analysis was used to analyze behavior patterns. Regarding
   learning performance, the proposed two-tier test can improve students'
   programming skills. Regarding behavior patterns, the two-tier test
   approach facilitates students to develop a learning by reviewing
   strategy, which is useful to improve their programming skills. (C) 2014

Title = {Beyond plagiarism: An active learning method to analyze causes behind
   code-similarity},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {70},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Code-similarity is the actual indicator of plagiarism in the context of
   programming assignments. However, the experiences of practical software
   development have empirically confirmed the existences of other causes
   for code-similarity. Existing practices usually overemphasis the casual
   relationship between code-similarity and plagiarism, but ignore the
   importance to make students understand other causes that also contribute
   to code-similarity. This paper presents an active learning method to
   involve students and instructors collaboratively in finding causes of
   code-similarity occurred in programming assignments. The result shows
   that most causes occurred in programming assignments are positive.
   Students can learn the different causes of code-similarity with pros and
   cons during conducting the active learning method. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {Automatically repairing tensor shape faults in deep learning programs},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {151},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Context: Software developers frequently invoke deep learning (DL) APIs
   to incorporate artificial intelligence solutions into software systems.
   However, misuses of these APIs can cause various DL faults, such as
   tensor shape faults. Tensor shape faults occur when restriction
   conditions of operations are not met; they are prevalent in practice,
   leading to many system crashes. Meanwhile, researchers and engineers
   still face a strong challenge in detecting tensor shape faults - static
   techniques incur heavy overheads in defining detection rules, and the
   only dynamic technique requires human engineers to rewrite APIs for
   tracking shape changes.
   Objective: This paper introduces a novel technique that leverages
   machine learning to detect tensor shape faults, and as well uses
   patterns to repair faults detected.
   Methods: We first construct SFData, a set of 146 buggy programs with
   crashing tensor shape faults (i.e., those causing programs to crash). We
   also conduct an empirical study on crashing tensor shape faults,
   categorizing them into four types and revealing twelve repair patterns.
   Then we propose Tensfa2, an automated approach to detecting and
   repairing crashing tensor shape faults. Tensfa2 employs a machine
   learning method to learn from crash messages and decision trees to
   detect tensor shape faults. Next, Tensfa2 tracks shape properties by a
   customized Python debugger, analyzes their data dependences, and uses
   the twelve patterns to generate patches. Tensfa2 is an extended version
   of Tensfa-our previous approach presented at ISSRE'21. Its performance
   is enhanced by two techniques: a search-based method for repairing shape
   value faults, and a bundle of three ranking strategies for prioritizing
   the repair patterns.
   Results: Tensfa2 is evaluated on SFData and IslamData (another dataset
   of tensor shape faults). The results show the effectiveness of Tensfa2.
   In particular, Tensfa2 achieves an F1-score of 96.88\% in detecting the
   faults and repairs 82 out of 146 buggy programs in SFData.
   Conclusion: We believe that repair patches generated by our approach
   will help engineers fix their deep learning programs much more
   efficiently, saving their time and efforts.},

Title = {Learning the ropes: strategies program directors use to facilitate
   organizational socialization of newcomer residents, a qualitative study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Background Many residents experience their transitions, such as from
   medical student to resident, as demanding and stressful. The challenges
   they face are twofold: coping with changes in tasks or responsibilities
   and performing (new) social roles. This process of `learning the ropes'
   is known as Organizational Socialization (OS). Although there is
   substantial literature on transitions from the perspective of residents,
   the voices of program directors (PDs) who facilitate and guide residents
   through the organizational socialization process have not yet been
   explored. PDs' perspectives are important, since PDs are formally
   responsible for Postgraduate Medical Education (PGME) and contribute,
   directly or indirectly, to residents' socialization process. Using the
   lens of OS, we explored what strategies PDs use to facilitate
   organizational socialization of newcomer residents. Methods We conducted
   semi-structured interviews with 17 PDs of different specialties. We used
   a theory-informing inductive data analysis study design, comprising an
   inductive thematic analysis, a deductive interpretation of the results
   through the lens of OS and, subsequently, an inductive analysis to
   identify overarching insights. Results We identified six strategies PDs
   used to facilitate organizational socialization of newcomer residents
   and uncovered two overarching insights. First, PDs varied in the extent
   to which they planned their guidance. Some PDs planned socialization as
   an explicit learning objective and assigned residents' tasks and
   responsibilities accordingly, making it an intended program outcome.
   However, socialization was also facilitated by social interactions in
   the workplace, making it an unintended program outcome. Second, PDs
   varied in the extent to which they adapted their strategies to the
   newcomer residents. Some PDs used individualized strategies tailored to
   individual residents' needs and skills, particularly in cases of poor
   performance, by broaching and discussing the issue or adjusting tasks
   and responsibilities. However, PDs also used workplace strategies
   requiring residents to adjust to the workplace without much
   intervention, which was often viewed as an implicit expectation.
   Conclusions PDs' used both intentional and unintentional strategies to
   facilitate socialization in residents, which may imply that
   socialization can occur irrespective of the PD's strategy. PDs'
   strategies varied from an individual-centered to a workplace-centered
   approach to socialization. Further research is needed to gain a deeper
   understanding of residents' perceptions of PD's efforts to facilitate
   their socialization process during transitions.},

Abstract = {In this work, we study students' behaviours from a blended programming
   learning environment that integrates learning analytics across physical
   and digital learning spaces. We designed a classroom study and collected
   data from a computer science class. Students' reviewing and reflecting
   behaviours, based on the use of a home-grown educational technology were
   tracked and modelled. Moreover, students' reviewing efforts, in terms of
   frequency, timing, and the associations with their academic performances
   were analysed. Results showed that high- and low-level students had
   distinct reviewing strategies. High-level students were more vigilant in
   reviewing. When they reviewed persistently, they achieved higher
   academic performances. Overall, students put extra emphasis on reviewing
   prior to the exams and the efforts demonstrated the desire to review
   formal assessments regardless of if they were graded for academic
   performance. In addition, all students paid more attention to reviewing
   quizzes and exams toward the end of the semester.},

Title = {Promoting Professional Project Management Skills in Engineering Higher
   Education: Project-Based Learning (PBL) Strategy},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to address the methodological process of
   promoting professional project management skills in Engineering Higher
   Education, evolving from Graduate to Postgraduate Programs. The strategy
   was born from a cooperative model of Project Based Learning (PBL)
   created with the experience of the GIE-Project, Educational Innovation
   Group (EIG) of the Technical University of Madrid (UPM), in
   collaboration with other EIG and industry stakeholders external to the
   university. The model has evolved and undergone various phases until
   being inserted in the European Space of Higher Education with the
   International Project Management Association (IPMA) competences. Over
   time GIE-Project strategy has developed into a process, an approach to
   designing, developing, implementing, evaluating and promoting
   professional Project Management skills in first (Graduate), second
   (Postgraduate) and third (PhD) cycle degree programmes. The results show
   how phasing in teaching aimed across different educational levels
   facilitates a gradual training in the 46 elements of professional
   competences required to obtain the IPMA's certification on Project
   Management. The educational strategy is conceived as a new teaching
   dimension within the framework of the EHEA, taking the course
   projects-Preliminary course, Final Degree Course Project and Final
   Master's Course Project-as an educational component suited for
   generating a ``pre-work experience'' to link teaching activity to the
   business and industrial environment. This paper shows the main success
   factors in the process that was carried out: the links between
   teaching-professional certification, the evaluation of professional
   competences, Project Based Learning, teaching subjects in connection
   with real-world problems, cooperative learning, mobility activities and
   integration and applied teaching-research.},

Title = {Analysis of Learning Behavior in an Automated Programming Assessment
   Environment: A Code Quality Perspective},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {167341-167354},
Abstract = {Automated programming assessment systems are useful tools to track the
   learning progress of students automatically and thereby reduce the
   workload of educators. They can also be used to gain insights into how
   students learn, making it easier to formulate strategies aimed at
   enhancing learning performance. Rather than functional code which is
   always inspected, code quality remains an essential aspect to which not
   many educators consider when designing an automated programming
   assessment system. In this study, we applied data mining techniques to
   analyze the results of an automated assessment system to reveal
   unexpressed patterns in code quality improvement that are predictive of
   final achievements in the course. Cluster analysis is first utilized to
   categorize students according to their learning behavior and outcomes.
   Cluster profile analysis is then leveraged to highlight actionable
   factors that could affect their final grades. Finally, the same factors
   are employed to construct a classification model by which to make early
   predictions of the students' final results. Our empirical results
   demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme in providing valuable
   insights into the learning behaviors of students in novice programming
   courses, especially in code quality assurance, which could be used to
   enhance programming performance at the university level.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, programming skills are receiving widespread attention for
   different age groups alongside occupational education programs to better
   prepare individuals for their future careers. However, introducing
   programming concepts in an appropriate manner is a challenge in higher
   education. The main assumption of this study is that enhancing the
   classical introduction to programming courses through real-life
   problem-based game development with Scratch programming environment
   potentially improves the learners' programming skills and motivation.
   Accordingly, in this study, during one academic semester period, the
   Introduction to Programming course for engineering students is enriched
   up to a certain level through real-life game development projects with
   Scratch. The students are followed within a four-year period starting
   from freshman until their graduation. The progress of the students who
   have taken the Introduction to Programming course in enriched or
   classical form in the fourth year Senior-project course are evaluated.
   The results show that by slightly improving the course curriculum
   through real-life game development projects in the Scratch environment,
   students' performance on the graduation projects improved significantly.
   As a conclusion, game-based learning, problem-based learning, visual
   programming and projects are technologies that can potentially help
   learners to perform better in the introduction to programming course, in
   turn affecting their performances in projects.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a learning experience designed to introduce
   students in a Micro-and Nanosystems course in a Physics Bachelor's
   degree program to the use of professional tools for the design and
   characterization of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) through a
   specific commercial case: the MEMS used by the well-known gaming
   platform Nintendo Wii. For this project, all the MEMS' fabrication steps
   were adapted to a teaching environment, from its design using specific
   software, to its experimental characterization after fabrication. The
   implementation of this learning strategy enhances students' learning
   autonomy while fostering multidirectional learning and active feedback
   between teachers and students. This innovative approach allows students
   to carry out collaborative work in a realistic environment and serves to
   introduce science students to tools and workflow typical of the
   engineering field. Although this learning strategy is particularized for
   students in a Micro-and Nanosystems course of a Physics Bachelor's
   degree program, it can be adapted to students of any scientific
   technical degree.},

Title = {A Cloud With a Silver Lining: Helping Students Learn About
   Professionalism},
Journal = {TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {304-312},
Abstract = {Problem: Educators face many challenges in teaching professionalism.
   Despite attempts to define professionalism, it remains abstract for
   students and often not fully appreciated until they are in clinic.
   Without a way to make it personally relevant, students will likely be
   less motivated to learn. Intervention: We used student-generated word
   clouds to facilitate reflection and discussions, thereby helping
   students make their perceptions of professionalism more explicit. Group
   discussion was followed by a 5-minute written reflection. Word clouds
   created in Semesters 1 and 7 enabled students to compare perceptions at
   two points in the curriculum. Context: The George Washington University
   Doctor of Physical Therapy Program is a 3-year, 8-semester, 109-credit
   postgraduate program that includes 34 weeks of clinical practice.
   Reflection is foundational to the curriculum, and students reflect on
   their learning and professional growth each semester. Historically,
   students were introduced to professionalism in Semester 1 using explicit
   instructional strategies. Despite the wealth of resources, readings, and
   discussions, engagement remained challenging. Outcome: Student-generated
   word clouds created a personally relevant visual from which uniquely
   designed prompts were created to facilitate discussion. Having students
   compare word clouds across semesters enabled them to identify what,
   when, how, and where they learned about professionalism. Word clouds,
   categorized words, and 5-minute written reflections provided evidence of
   individual and collective changes in student perceptions. Lessons
   Learned: Students will engage in rich discussions on professionalism if
   it is personally relevant. Anonymity can foster discussion on personal
   characteristics and biases. Visualization of student-generated,
   narrative data enhanced reflection and discussion. Comparing word clouds
   from two points in time helped students articulate changes in their
   perceptions of professionalism. A 5-minute reflection can be a powerful
   learning tool for students and faculty. Outcomes demonstrated the value
   of designing interventions grounded in the educational principles.},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {{[}This paper is part of the Focused Collection on Preparing and
   Supporting University Physics Educators.] University educators (UEs)
   have a long history of teaching physics not only in formal
   classroomsettings but also in informal outreach environments. The
   pedagogical practices of UEs in informal physics teaching have not been
   widely studied, and they may provide insight into formal practices and
   preparation. We investigate the interactions between UEs and children in
   an afterschool physics program facilitated by university physics
   students from the University of Colorado Boulder. In this program,
   physics undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers
   work with K-8 children on hands-on physics activities on a weekly basis
   over the course of a semester. We use an activity theoretic framework as
   a tool to examine situational aspects of individuals' behavior in the
   complex structure of the afterschool program. Using this framework, we
   analyze video of UE-child interactions and identify three main
   pedagogical modalities that UEs display during activities: instruction,
   consultation, and participation modes. These modes are characterized by
   certain language, physical location, and objectives that establish
   differences in UE-child roles and division of labor. Based on this
   analysis, we discuss implications for promoting pedagogical strategies
   through purposeful curriculum development and university educator
   preparation.},

Title = {Learning how to learn: Meta-learning strategies for the challenges of
   learning pharmacology},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {38},
Pages = {2-4},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: Nursing students have difficulty with pharmacology courses
   because of the complicated nomenclature and the difficulty of applying
   drug information to actual patient care.
   Objectives: As part of a new pharmacology course being created,
   meta-learning strategies designed to diminish the difficulties of
   learning this difficult content were part of the course pedagogy.
   Design: Strategies were demonstrated, reviewed in class, and implemented
   through homework assignments.
   Setting: The setting was an Academic Health Center's School of Nursing
   in the southern United States.
   Participants: Participants were third-year nursing students in an
   undergraduate nursing program.
   Methods: Surveys of students' opinions of learning gains were conducted
   at the end of the course over several semesters. In addition,
   pharmacology scores on a standardized exit exam were compared prior to
   implementing the course and after.
   Results: Students reported learning dry material more easily, having
   greater confidence, and finding substantial value in the learning
   strategies. Students indicated the most helpful strategies, in
   descending order, as follows: making charts to compare and contrast
   drugs and drug classes, writing out drug flash cards, making or
   reviewing creative projects, prioritizing information, making or using
   visual study aids, and using time and repetition to space learning.
   Implementation of the new course improved pharmacology scores on a
   standardized exit exam from 67.0\% to 74.3\%.
   Conclusions: Overall response to learning strategies was positive, and
   the increase in the pharmacology standardized exit exam scores
   demonstrated the effectiveness of this instructional approach. (C) 2016

Title = {Optimization and Combination Analysis of English Multimodule Learning
   Strategies based on Computational Intelligence},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {AUG 24},
Abstract = {Due to the stagnation of foreign language teaching method research and
   the rapid development of cognitive psychology, in the early 1970s, the
   research focus of foreign language teaching changed from teacher to
   student research. In this context, the research of English learning
   strategy entered the historical stage of foreign language teaching
   research, and the global research of foreign language learning strategy
   was launched. In the past 30 years, the study of English learning
   strategy has been a hot research topic in the field of education in
   China. Finally, we conclude that English learning strategy training is
   the result of learning strategy training. In addition, the learning
   strategy training also effectively improves the English learning level
   of the students in the experimental class. This study aims to solve the
   problem of optimization and combination of English learning strategies,
   find effective ways and implement feasible programs, and propose
   theoretical and practical ways in college English teaching reforms. The
   connotation of ``multimodule{''} has not been given due attention, so
   its role has not been fully brought into play. The following questions
   are answered, such as ``teach students complete skills,{''} ``train
   students in strategies,{''} ``treat the teaching process correctly,{''}
   ``Chinese computational intelligence has many patterns, but few
   practical effects{''} and ``get rid of the strange theory that cannot be
   taught on the basis of computational intelligence{''} and ``let students
   experience the practical process of English multimodule learning
   strategies and applications based on computational intelligence. The
   problems all seem to be related to ``multimodules.{''}},

Title = {Transitioning from introductory block-based and text-based environments
   to professional programming languages in high school computer science
   classrooms},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Block-based programming languages are becoming increasingly common in
   introductory computer science classrooms across the K-12 spectrum. One
   justification for the use of block-based environments in formal
   educational settings is the idea that the concepts and practices
   developed using these introductory tools will prepare learners for
   future computer science learning opportunities. This view is built on
   the assumption that the attitudinal and conceptual learning gains made
   while working in the introductory block-based environments will transfer
   to conventional text-based programming languages. To test this
   hypothesis, this paper presents the results of a quasi-experimental
   classroom study in which programming novices spent five-week using
   either a block-based or text-based programming environment. After five
   weeks in the introductory tool, students transitioned to Java, a
   conventional text-based programming language. The study followed
   students for 10 weeks after the transition. Over the course of the
   15-week study, attitudinal and conceptual assessments were administered
   and student-authored programs were collected. Conceptual learning,
   attitudinal shifts, and changes in programming practices were analyzed
   to evaluate how introductory modality impacted learners as they
   transitioned to a professional, text-based programming language. The
   findings from this study build on earlier work that found a difference
   in performance on content assessments after the introductory portion of
   the study (Weintrop \& Wilensky, 2017a). This paper shows the difference
   in conceptual learning that emerged after five weeks between the
   block-based and text-based conditions fades after 10 weeks in Java. No
   differences in programming practices were found between the two
   conditions while working in Java. Likewise, differences in attitudinal
   measures that emerged after working in the introductory environments
   also faded after 10 weeks in Java, resulting in no difference between
   the conditions after 15 weeks. The contribution of this work is to
   advance our understanding of the benefits and limits of block-based
   programming tools in preparing students for future computer science
   learning. This paper presents the first quasi-experimental study of the
   transfer of knowledge between block-based and text-based environments in
   a high school setting. The lack of significant differences between the
   two introductory programming modalities after learners transition to
   professional programming languages is discussed along with the
   implications of these findings for computer science education
   researchers and educators, as well as for the broader community of
   researchers studying the role of technology in education.},

Title = {Using game concepts to improve programming learning: A multi-level
   meta-analysis},
Journal = {COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 20},
Abstract = {Gamification has been widely used in education due to its application to
   different contexts. The vast number of possibilities allows the creation
   of learning strategies that lead to students' success. Despite the high
   acceptance of gamification among several authors in educational
   contexts, there are many dispersed studies with high differences in
   their results. Although gamification impacts motivation, interest, and
   engagement, its effect on students' learning outcomes needs to be
   clarified. This study aims to investigate the effects of gamification on
   programming learning and the impact of the most used game concepts on
   knowledge acquisition. A multi-level meta-analysis was conducted on
   studies above K-12 to understand the effects of gamification in
   programming learning. From 15 combined effect sizes, it was analyzed the
   effect of points, badges, levels, avatars, leaderboards, and the number
   of elements used. The results showed that gamification leads to a
   significant increase in the results (Cohen's d = 0.4) but essentially
   due to the use of levels (p < .05). Using badges, points, avatars, and
   leaderboards showed no significant effect on programming learning,
   suggesting that these elements may be more beneficial to motivating or
   engaging the students. Gamification can be efficient in programming
   learning, but it is recommended the use of levels.},

Abstract = {This qualitative study describes the results of a phenomenographic
   analysis of teachers' conceptions of mobile learning. Fifteen senior
   high school (Grades 10-12) teachers from five schools in northern Taiwan
   involved in a national mobile learning program participated in this
   study. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews. Through
   data analysis, six qualitatively different conceptions of mobile
   learning were obtained: 1) meeting students' preferences, 2) conducting
   classes with efficiency, 3) invigorating and enhancing learning, 4)
   parting from traditional teaching, 5) focusing on student ownership, and
   6) extending learning beyond school. The conception categories form a
   hierarchy and show a trajectory moving from teacher-/content-oriented to
   learner-/learning-oriented conceptions. In addition, technology was
   almost invisible in the more sophisticated conceptions. Finally,
   juxtaposing the conception categories with the replacement,
   amplification, and transformation framework revealed that teachers'
   central ideas regarding mobile learning fell within the amplification
   category, suggesting the use of technology mainly to increase efficiency
   and productivity. It is concluded that for mobile devices to exert
   transformative power on learning, it might be necessary to cultivate the
   more sophisticated conceptions of mobile learning among teachers. (C)

Abstract = {This study aimed to utilize a novel modified approach based on
   teaching-learning-based optimization (MTLBO), to achieve an approximate
   solution of optimal control problem governed by nonlinear Volterra
   integro-differential systems. The scheme was based upon Chebyshev
   wavelet and its derivative operational matrix, which eventually led to a
   nonlinear programming problem (NLP). The resulted NLP was solved by the
   MTLBO. The novel algorithm used a heuristic mechanism to intensify
   learning on the best students in learner phase. The new strategy was
   applied to improve learners' knowledge and to structure the MTLBO. The
   applicability and efficiency of the MTLBO were shown for three numerical
   examples. The proposed algorithm was compared with the traditional TLBO
   algorithm and the Legendre wavelets and collocation method in the
   literature. The experimental results showed that the proposed MTLBO not
   only obtained the high-quality solutions with respect to the absolute
   errors but also provided results with the high speed of convergence.},

Title = {Predicting preservice teachers' intention to use technology-enabled
   learning},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {168},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This predictive correlational study examines to what extent the
   constructs of the Theory of Planned Behavior and program factors (i.e.,
   classification and program of study) can predict preservice teachers'
   intention to use technology-enabled learning (TEL), a student-centered
   approach to technology integration as a cognitive tool. A survey was
   distributed to preservice teachers enrolled in a college of education at
   a midsize, public teaching university. The findings of this study cohere

Abstract = {Learning computer programming requires acquiring multiple skills to be
   performed simultaneously. As in many other fields, learning motivation
   and reflective thinking skills may affect the process of designing and
   implementing computer programming instruction. This study examines how
   learning motivation and reflective thinking skills predict academic
   achievement in computer programming and programming laboratory courses.
   The participants were 140 undergraduate students enrolled in the Faculty
   of Engineering. Data were collected by using learning motivation on
   computer programming courses and reflective thinking skill scales. In
   the study, multiple linear regression analysis was used for data
   analysis. The first results showed that reflective thinking and learning
   motivation predict academic achievement together in programming courses.
   For academic achievement in the computer programming course, only
   reasoning was found to be significant and for academic achievement in
   the programming laboratory course, both reasoning and intrinsic
   motivation appeared to be significant. Although reasoning showed the
   highest relationship with academic achievement of computer programming,
   intrinsic motivation showed the highest relationship with academic
   achievement of the programming laboratory course. The results of the
   research were discussed in a way as to guide future studies.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a study of teaching a programming language in a C
   programming course by having students assemble and program a low-cost
   mobile robot. Writing their own programs to define the robot's behavior
   raised students' motivation. Working in small groups, students
   programmed the robots by using the control structures of structured
   programming. Over the course, there was a significant improvement in
   students' academic performance and motivation. The approach took into
   account four of the motivational factors that feature in the ARCS model:
   1) attention; 2) relevance; 3) confidence; and 4) satisfaction. The main
   achievements of the approach were to be able to: 1) catch and hold
   students' attention throughout the course; 2) increase students'
   confidence in the learning process; 3) achieve a high student
   satisfaction level with their acquired skills; and 4) demonstrate to
   students the practical usefulness of the knowledge they had learned.
   This paper also determines the extent to which this strategy was
   effective in meeting the teaching goals.},

Title = {A national training program for simulation educators and technicians:
   evaluation strategy and outcomes},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {Background: Simulation-based education (SBE) has seen a dramatic uptake
   in health professions education over the last decade. SBE offers
   learning opportunities that are difficult to access by other methods.
   Competent faculty is seen as key to high quality SBE. In 2011, in
   response to a significant national healthcare issue - the need to
   enhance the quality and scale of SBE - a group of Australian
   universities was commissioned to develop a national training program
   Australian Simulation Educator and Technician Training (AusSETT)
   Program. This paper reports the evaluation of this large-scale
   initiative.
   Methods: The AusSETT Program adopted a train-the-trainer model, which
   offered up to three days of workshops and between four and eight hours
   of e-learning. The Program was offered across all professions in all
   states and territories. Three hundred and three participants attended
   workshops with 230 also completing e-learning modules. Topics included:
   foundational learning theory; orientation to diverse simulation
   modalities; briefing; and debriefing. A layered objectives-oriented
   evaluation strategy was adopted with multiple stakeholders
   (participants, external experts), methods of data collection (end of
   module evaluations, workshop observer reports and individual interviews)
   and at multiple data points (immediate and two months later).
   Descriptive statistics were used to analyse numerical data while textual
   data (written comments and transcripts of interviews) underwent content
   or thematic analysis.
   Results: For each module, between 45 and 254 participants completed
   evaluations. The content and educational methods were rated highly with
   items exceeding the pre-established standard. In written evaluations,
   participants identified strengths (e.g. high quality facilitation,
   breadth and depth of content) and areas for development (e.g. electronic
   portfolio, learning management system) of the Program. Interviews with
   participants suggested the Program had positively impacted their
   educational practices. Observers reported a high quality educational
   experience for participants with alignment of content and methods with
   perceived participant needs.
   Conclusions: The AusSETT Program is a significant and enduring learning
   resource. The development of a national training program to support a
   competent simulation workforce is feasible. The Program objectives were
   largely met. Although there are limitations with the study design (e.g.
   self-report), there are strengths such as exploring the impact two
   months later. The evaluation of the Program informs the next phase of
   the national strategy for simulation educators and technicians with
   respect to content and processes, strengths and areas for development.},

Abstract = {In this work, we study students' learning effectiveness through their
   use of a homegrown innovative educational technology, Web Programming
   Grading Assistant (WPGA), which facilitates grading and feedback
   delivery of paper-based assessments. We designed a lab study and a
   classroom study from a lower-division blended-instruction computer
   science course. We evaluated a partial credit assignment algorithm. We
   tracked and modeled students' learning behaviors through their use of
   WPGA. Results showed that students demonstrated an effort and desire to
   review assessments regardless of if they were graded for academic
   performance or for attendance. Diligent students achieved higher exam
   scores on average and were found to review their exams and the correct
   questions frequently. Additionally, student cohorts exhibited similar
   initial reviewing patterns, but different in-depth reviewing and
   reflecting strategies. Ultimately, the work contributes to
   multidimensional learning analytics aggregation across the physical and
   cybersphere.},

Title = {Towards teaching as design: Exploring the interplay between

   Development},

Abstract = {Recent research suggests that training teachers as learning designers
   helps promote technology-enhanced educational innovations. However,
   little attention has been paid so far to the interplay between the
   effectiveness of Teacher Professional Development (TPD) instructional
   models promoting the role of teachers as designers and the capabilities
   (and pitfalls) of the heterogeneous landscape of available Learning
   Design (LD) tooling employed to support such TPD. This paper describes a
   mixed method study that explores the use of a novel Integrated Learning
   Design Environment (ILDE) for supporting a TPD program on Information
   and Communication Technologies (ICT) and Collaborative Learning (CL). 36
   Adult Education (AE) and Higher Education (HE) inservice teachers, with
   little experience on both CL and ICT integration, participated in a
   study encompassing training workshops and follow-up full-lifecycle
   learning design processes (from initial conceptualization to
   implementation with a total of 176 students). The findings from our
   interpretive study showcase the benefits (and required effort) derived
   from the use of an integrated platform that guides teachers along the
   main phases of the learning design process, and that automates certain
   technological setup tasks needed for the classroom enactment. The study
   also highlights the need for adaptation of the TPD instructional model
   to the learning curve associated to the LD tooling, and explores its
   impact on the attitude of teachers towards future adoption of LD
   practices. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A cross-sectional study of pedagogical strategies in nursing education:
   opportunities and constraints toward using effective pedagogy},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {Background: The continuous, rapid evolution of medical technology, the
   public need for ever more complex health-care services and the stagnant
   global economic situation have posed difficult new challenges for the
   nursing profession. The need to integrate knowledge, technical skill and
   ethical conduct in nursing practice has become ever more evident,
   particularly in response to the emerging challenges over recent years.
   Major research studies have highlighted that high-quality responses to
   health needs is highly dependent on both the education received by
   health care professionals and the pedagogical strategies employed in
   such training. The aim of this study was to identify the pedagogical
   strategies used by teachers in nursing programs in the Italian
   university system and to classify them according to the didactic
   architectures that are used.
   Methods: The study sample was recruited from the entire population of
   nursing instructors teaching in all years of their respective programs,
   in every Italian university with a nursing program. A three-part
   questionnaire, based on a Calvani taxonomy, was designed to collect both
   demographic and cultural information on the sample subjects, as well as
   the pedagogical strategies that they may have used in their teaching
   practices, was administered to all nursing instructors. A five-point
   Likert scale was used to measure the frequency of use of different
   pedagogical strategies.
   Results: On the whole, 992 teachers participated in the study (80.1 \%
   of the teachers contacted). Experience data suggest a highly-educated
   overall instructor population. The settings in which the participants
   carried out their teaching activities were represented mostly by large
   lecture halls and the number of students in their classes were for the
   most part rather large; over 60. Frequency of use revealed that the most
   commonly used method was the traditional lecture. Indeed, 85.7 \% of the
   respondents ``often{''} or ``always{''} used pedagogical strategies
   belonging to a `receptive architecture'.
   Conclusions: Any redefining of approaches to nursing education must
   consider several key factors to ensure the promotion of student-focused
   pedagogical strategies. Only through the implementation of such
   pedagogical practices will it be possible to generate the knowledge and
   skills necessary for future professionals to be able to adequately
   respond to the ever more complex health care needs of the population.},

Title = {Reinforcement Learning Based on Equivalent Consumption Minimization
   Strategy for Optimal Control of Hybrid Electric Vehicles},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {860-871},
Abstract = {Hybrid electric vehicles, operated by engines and motors, require an
   energy management strategy to achieve competitive fuel economy
   performance. The equivalent consumption minimization strategy is a
   well-known algorithm that can be employed for the energy management of
   hybrid electric vehicles, based on the concept of the equivalent cost of
   fossil fuels and electric battery energy. However, in the equivalent
   consumption minimization strategy approach, a parameter called the
   equivalent factor should be determined to obtain the optimal control
   policy. In this study, reinforcement learning based approaches are
   proposed to determine the equivalent factor. First, we show that the
   equivalent factor can be indirectly extracted from the reinforcement
   learning results, using the control action from reinforcement learning
   for the specific driving cycle. In addition, a novel approach that
   combines reinforcement learning and the equivalent consumption
   minimization strategy is proposed, where the equivalent factor is
   determined based on the interaction between the reinforcement learning
   agent and driving environment, while the control input is decided by the
   equivalent consumption minimization strategy based on the determined
   equivalent factor. A model-based reinforcement learning method is used,
   and the proposed method is validated for vehicle simulation using a
   parallel hybrid electric vehicle. The simulation results show that the
   proposed method can achieve a near-optimal solution, which is close to
   the global solution obtained with the dynamic programming approach
   (96.7\% compared to dynamic programming result in average), and improved
   performance of 4.3\% in average compared with the existing adaptive
   equivalent consumption minimization strategy.},

Abstract = {Issues of diversity, equity, inclusion, and respect have a history at
   colleges and universities in the United States. Over 40 years ago, to
   address these issues at a large public university, the authors created a
   ``tutorial program{''} (equivalent to a parallel educational system)
   that enabled a diverse cohort of students to succeed in their general
   chemistry courses. The authors analyzed the teaching system (e.g., the
   campus climate, the curriculum, the instructors, the students) for
   factors that differentially impacted the ability of students to learn
   and used qualitative research strategies that enabled students to
   identify their specific learning barriers. Then, they worked
   collaboratively with students to create social and academic options for
   effective learning, building community. The result, the Chemistry
   Tutorial Program for Minority/Disadvantaged students (later renamed as
   the Chemistry Learning Center), continues to this day. Unfortunately,
   unresolved issues of diversity, equity, inclusion, and respect continue
   as well. Looking to the future, the tools of applied research could
   engage chemistry faculty, chemical education researchers, chemistry
   students, and other stakeholders to improve student success rates by
   systematically reducing local learning barriers.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThis study aimed to identify and explain the strategies of
   faculty development based on their role at Iranian Universities of
   Medical Sciences.MethodsWe conducted a qualitative content analysis
   study in 2021 using purposive, snowball sampling, with a maximum
   variation in the faculty members' age and experience level. Twenty four
   participants were enrolled in this study (eighteen faculty members and
   six medical sciences students); data collection consisted of two phases
   of semi-structured interviews and a brainstorming group technique. Data
   were categorized into two themes and six related subthemes, based on
   their similarities and differences after frequent
   summarization.ResultsThe data analysis yielded two themes and eight
   categories. The first theme was to explain competencies based on role
   and task with two sub-themes: Tasks and capabilities and development and
   excellence of personal qualities. The second theme was the best
   strategies for empowering the teachers with four sub-themes, including
   problem-based learning, integration of methods, evaluation-based
   education, and scholarship in education (PIES), which explains the
   strategies that can support the development of teachers in medical
   sciences universities, and all the concepts were interrelated to each
   other.ConclusionFrom the experiences of faculty members, the importance
   of some strategies in education and empowering the teachers'
   professional competence dimensions should be emphasized. PIES could
   explain the practical strategies that can support the development of
   teachers in medical sciences universities.},

Title = {A Statewide Strategy for Expanding Graduate Medical Education by

Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},

Volume = {90},

Abstract = {The graduate medical education (GME) system in the United States is in
   need of reform to ensure that the physician workforce being trained is
   able to meet the current and future health care needs of the population.
   However, GME funding to existing teaching hospitals and programs relies
   heavily on support from Medicare, which was capped in 1997. Thus, new,
   innovative models to expand GME are needed. To address physician
   shortages, especially in primary care and general surgery and in rural
   areas, the state of Georgia implemented a statewide initiative. They
   increased medical school enrollment by 600 students from 2000 to 2010
   and committed to establishing new GME programs at new teaching hospitals
   to train 400 additional residents by 2018. As increasing the capacity of
   GME programs likely increases the number of physicians practicing in the
   state, these efforts aim to encourage trainees to practice in Georgia.
   Although new teaching hospitals, like these, are eligible for new
   Medicare funding, this approach to expanding GME also incorporates state
   funding to cover the start-up costs associated with establishing a new
   teaching hospital and GME program.
   In this article, the authors provide background on the current state of
   GME funding in the United States and on the physician workforce and
   medical education system in Georgia. They then outline the steps taken
   to expand GME by establishing new teaching hospitals and programs. They
   conclude by sharing outcomes to date as well as challenges faced and
   lessons learned so that others can follow this novel model.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study explored preservice and in-service early childhood
   teachers' online academic learning beliefs and strategies.
   Design/methodology/approach Two hundred preservice and in-service
   teachers respectively from Taiwan participated in this research. A focus
   group discussion was carried out concerning the development of the
   questionnaires. The exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis
   confirmed good construct validity and reliabilities of the survey.
   Findings The survey results showed that in-service teachers generally
   held more sophisticated learning beliefs than the preservice teachers in
   all scales. Also, in-service teachers responded with a higher level of
   online academic learning strategies than the preservice teachers did.
   Regarding their online experiences, preservice teachers who spent an
   appropriate amount of time online had more positive beliefs than those
   with excessive online experiences. However, preservice teachers did not
   reveal employment of their ICT literacy in their online academic
   learning strategies. It was found that those in-service teachers with
   more online learning experience also showed higher levels of online
   academic learning beliefs. They used more deep strategies in their
   online academic learning. Practical implications The findings of this
   study could provide insights for the development of online academic
   learning ability in preschool teacher training programs.
   Originality/value (1) In-service teachers generally held more
   sophisticated learning beliefs than the preservice teachers. (2)
   Preservice teachers who spent an appropriate amount of time online had
   more positive beliefs than those with excessive online experiences. (3)
   Preservice teachers did not reveal employment of their ICT literacy in
   their online academic learning strategies. (4) In-service teachers with
   more online learning experience also showed higher levels of online
   academic learning beliefs. They used more deep strategies in their
   online academic learning.},

Title = {Neural-Guided Inductive Synthesis of Functional Programs on List
   Manipulation by Offline Supervised Learning},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Volume = {9},
Pages = {71521-71534},
Abstract = {Synthesizing intended programs from user-specified input-output
   examples, also known as Programming by Examples (PBE), is a challenging
   problem in program synthesis, and has been applied to a wide range of
   domains. A key challenge in PBE is to efficiently discover a
   user-intended program in the search space that can be exponentially
   large. In this work, we propose a method for automatic synthesis of
   functional programs on list manipulation, by using offline-trained
   Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models to guide the program search. We
   adopt miniKanren, an embedded domain-specific language for flexible
   relational programming, as an underlying top-down deductive search
   engine of candidate programs that are consistent with input-output
   examples. Our approach targets an easy and effective integration of deep
   learning techniques in making better PBE systems and combines two
   technical ideas on generating diverse training dataset and designing
   rich feature embeddings of probable subproblems for synthesis generated
   by deductive search. The offline-learned model is then used in PBE to
   guide the top-down deductive search with specific strategies. To
   practically manipulate data structures of lists, our method synthesizes
   functional programs with popular higher-order combinators including map,
   foldl and foldr. We have implemented our method and evaluated it with
   challenging program synthesis tasks on list manipulation. The
   experiments show promising results on the performance of our method
   compared to related state-of-the-art inductive synthesizers.},

Abstract = {IntroductionThe Educational Scholar Program (ESP) is a creative method
   to focus on the quality of education and the scholarship of education.
   This paper critically investigated how educational educators perceived
   the Educational Scholar Program.MethodThe ESP was developed according to
   the project-based learning method. An interdisciplinary strategy was
   used by participating educators from different schools, including
   nursing, medicine, public health, dentistry, and pharmacy. (n = 27).
   Semi-structured interviews explored the experiences of the participants
   in the ESP. A conventional content analysis approach introduced by
   Graneheim and Lundman was used for data analysis.ResultsA theme of ``a
   developmental pathway toward leadership for educational change{''} was
   explored into four categories: ``Motivated for educational change,{''}
   ``collaborative learning through the application of knowledge,{''}
   ``tensions of change agent,{''} and ``a perceived responsibility of a
   change agent.{''}ConclusionThe participants perceived the ESP as a
   platform for improving leadership capabilities for educational change
   through the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL). Using the ESP
   as a faculty development program to train educational leadership for
   change is suggested.},

Title = {Residents' Views of the Role of Classroom-Based Learning in Graduate
   Medical Education Through the Lens of Academic Half Days},

Abstract = {Purpose
   To examine the role of classroom-based learning in graduate medical
   education through the lens of academic half days (AHDs) by exploring
   residents' perceptions of AHDs' purpose and relevance and the
   effectiveness of teaching and learning in AHDs.
   Method
   The authors invited a total of 186 residents in three programs (internal
   medicine, orthopedic surgery, and hematology) at the University of
   British Columbia Faculty of Medicine to participate in semistructured
   focus groups from October 2010 to February 2011. Verbatim transcripts of
   the interviews underwent inductive analysis.
   Results
   Twenty-seven residents across the three programs volunteered to
   participate. Two major findings emerged. Purpose and relevance of AHDs:
   Residents believed that AHDs are primarily for knowledge acquisition and
   should complement clinical learning. Classroom learning facilitated
   consolidation of clinical experiences with expert clinical reasoning.
   Social aspects of AHDs were highly valued as an important secondary
   purpose. Perceived effectiveness of teaching and learning: Case-based
   teaching engaged residents in critical thinking; active learning was
   valued. Knowledge retention was considered suboptimal. Perspectives on
   the concept of AHDs as ``protected time{''} varied in the three
   programs.
   Conclusions
   Findings suggest that (1) engagement in classroom learning occurs
   through participation in clinically oriented discussions that highlight
   expert reasoning processes; (2) formal classroom teaching, which focuses
   on knowledge acquisition, can enhance informal learning occurring during
   clinical activity; and (3) social aspects of AHDs, including their role
   in creating communities of practice in residency programs and in
   professional identity formation, are an important, underappreciated
   asset for residency programs.},

Title = {HY-POP: Hyperparameter optimization of machine learning models through
   parametric programming},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {139},
Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {Fitting a machine learning model often requires presetting parameter
   values (hyperparameters) that control how an algorithm learns from the
   data. Selecting an optimal model that minimizes error and generalizes
   well to unseen data becomes a problem of tuning or optimizing these
   hyperparameters. Typical hyperparameter optimization strategies involve
   discretizing the parameter space and implementing an iterative search
   procedure to approximate the optimal hyperparameter and model selection
   through cross-validation. Instead, for machine learning algorithms that
   are formulated as linear or quadratic programming (LP/QP) models, an
   exact solution to the hyperparameter optimization problem is obtainable
   through parametric programming without any approximation. First, the
   hyperparameter optimization problem is posed more naturally as a bilevel
   optimization. Second, using parametric programming theory, the bilevel
   optimization is reformulated into a single level problem. Exact
   solutions to the hyperparameter optimization problem for LASSO
   regression and LP L-1-norm support vector machine (SVM) are derived and
   validated on example data. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Teaching computer programming to secondary school students has continued
   to further attract the researchers' and practitioners' attention in
   recent years. These young learners do not have enough computer
   programming knowledge and skills while they continue to waste huge
   amount of time for playing video games. One way to cope both problems is
   redirecting students' energy from playing video games to learning video
   game programming. This qualitative study proposes a solution based on
   game-based instruction and learning by design approaches to address the
   aforementioned problems. The research method is Design-Based Research.
   Qualitative data was collected from the students in an Iranian secondary
   school and their parents. The main output of this study is in the form
   of instructional design principles for teaching programming to secondary
   school students. The problems caused by the students' excessive video
   game playing, the impact of applying the mentioned principles on
   spending time on video games, the students' learning quality, and their
   satisfaction are also taken into account.},

Title = {Developing an AI-based chatbot for practicing responsive teaching in
   mathematics},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {191},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Responsive teaching promotes students' mathematical reasoning and
   positive attitudes toward mathematics. Due to the complexity of the work
   of teaching, preservice teachers (PSTs) have been provided with
   approximated opportunities to practice responsive teaching skills in
   teacher edu-cation programs. Although increasing demand for adaptive
   learning reinforces the need for research on artificial intelligence
   (AI) in education, there have been few approaches that engaged learners
   in meaningful interactions. Our goal was to develop an AI-based chatbot
   that engaged PSTs in an authentic, meaningful, and open-ended teaching
   situation to enhance PSTs' responsive teaching skills, specifically
   questioning skills through approximations of practice. The chatbot was
   designed to act as a virtual student who displayed misconceptions on the
   topic of fractions. By employing design-based research, we examined 1)
   design features and structure of the chatbot, 2) coverage of users'
   input, 3) PSTs' questioning patterns, and 4) users' experiences. Two
   iter-ations of design, implementation and evaluation took place in an
   elementary mathematics edu-cation methods course. To build the chatbot
   we qualitatively analyzed the training data, categorized them into the
   smallest meaningful intents of users, and prepared corresponding
   re-sponses to each intent. At the final iteration, the refined chatbot
   adequately covered PSTs' questions and provided realistic responses. We
   found a pattern of PSTs asking similar questions repeatedly in the
   conversation data. Through multiple iterations, certain design features
   could lead to improved questioning patterns and user perceptions,
   including sequential responses, informing responses, and
   personification. Implications, design features, and limitations are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The number of students in colleges and universities across the country
   is increasing. The quality of teaching in university classrooms has
   become very important. The rapid changes of the times have also put
   forward new requirements for classroom teaching methods. Therefore, for
   modern higher art education, traditional teaching methods and one-to-one
   many teaching modes have been unable to meet the demand, nor can they
   guarantee the quality of teaching. Based on modern technology, this
   article transfers the traditional classroom teaching mode to the
   Internet to realize a new mode of online remote network teaching. An
   embedded system is a hard real-time system composed of a large number of
   processing units interconnected through a shared bus to support
   distributed functional end-to-end computing. Embedded systems related to
   self-connection must consider safety, because insecure factors will
   threaten the system and even the lives of people. Aiming at the
   development of multifunctional hybrid critical heterogeneous embedded
   system, this paper proposes a key path tabu search algorithm and message
   movement strategy to solve the problem of optimizing development cost.
   The KPTS algorithm uses a tree-shaped taboo list to find a solution that
   has low development cost and satisfies the constraint of response time.
   The message migration strategy is a way to reduce development costs,
   that is, to avoid recursive increases in task SIL. Based on the current
   advanced teaching system, database technology, education platform and
   programming methods in our country, this paper designs a set of remote
   online teaching system, thus establishing a multi-category education
   teaching system based on the B/S network structure, and based on
   teachers, students and administrators have constructed a teaching model
   of offline teacher-student interaction and online teaching and learning
   with a complete database, which will greatly enrich the diversity of
   teaching methods and teaching methods in universities.},

Title = {The Impact of Work-Integrated Learning and Learning Strategies on
   Engineering Students' Learning Outcomes in Thailand: A Multiple
   Mediation Model of Learning Experiences and Psychological Factors},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {111390-111406},
Abstract = {Learning outcomes (LOs) provide an essential foundation for evaluating
   the effectiveness of higher education institutions (HEIs). LOs have been
   accepted as criteria for accrediting academic programs; however, little
   is known about why students vary in their desired outcomes and how
   experiences in the workplace and learning strategies have different
   impacts on LOs. Based on social cognitive career theory (SCCT), this
   study investigated the relationships among work-integrated learning
   (WIL), learning strategies, institutional and goal commitments,
   engineering skill self-efficacy, engineering career outcome
   expectations, lifelong learning skills (LLLs), achievement goal
   orientation, and LOs. The participant pool consisted of 1,316
   undergraduate engineering students from 11 HEIs in Thailand. Hypotheses
   regarding the causal relationships, including the direct and indirect
   effects, were examined by using structural equation modeling (SEM). Both
   the measurement and structural equation models showed a good fit to the
   data. The results of the SEM indicated that achievement goal
   orientation, LLLs, and engineering skill self-efficacy had significant
   positive direct effects on LOs. Learning strategies had a strong direct
   effect on LLLs and institutional and goal commitments. The practice of
   WIL in the workplace was an important factor in building engineering
   skill self-efficacy and LLLs. The mediation analysis indicated that
   learning experience (i.e., institutional and goal commitments) and
   psychological factors played important roles in the relationship between
   learning strategies and LOs. This study confirmed and expanded the SCCT
   research. Finally, theoretical and practical implications for LO
   development were identified based on the results.},

Abstract = {The Chemistry Teaching Fellowship Program (CTFP) is offered to graduate
   students and postdoctoral researchers at the University of Toronto as an
   opportunity to undertake curriculum development and chemistry education
   research. Projects are run with faculty supervision and focus on
   designing new laboratory activities, lectures, tutorials, workshops, and
   assignments. Since its launch in 2002, many CTFP projects have been
   implemented in the departmental undergraduate curriculum, and several
   have been published in this Journal. The structure and history of the
   CTFP and its impact on undergraduate education and graduate student
   professional development is discussed in this paper, with a selection of
   projects highlighted as case studies. The CTFP provides a successful
   model of curriculum renewal that can easily be incorporated into other
   chemistry departments.},

Title = {Sustainable Approach to Teaching Embedded Systems with Hands-On
   Project-Based Visible Learning},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {814-829},
Abstract = {Although purchasing state-of-the-art teaching equipment may be
   financially demanding, substantial efforts are being made at the
   Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim to
   provide students with an enhanced hands-on embedded system design
   experience in a sustainable manner. In particular, an approach that
   consists of adopting low-cost commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components
   and tools for learning purposes is proposed in this work. This strategy
   effectively combines both industry standard highly-reliable automation
   controllers, such as Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) technology, as
   well as novel microcontrollers (i.e., the micro:bit microcontroller
   based on the nRF51822 system-on-chip (SoC)) explicitly designed for use
   in embedded systems education. This contributes towards a hands-on
   sustainable learning experience based on the applicability of Visible
   Learning (VL). The objective of this paper is to propose a novel
   organisation of the embedded systems module for the engineering
   cybernetics education curriculum. The intended outcome is to promote a
   novel teaching approach. This is achieved by engaging students in both a
   series of organised theoretical lectures as well as practical and highly
   involving laboratory group projects. Surface learning sections and deep
   learning sections are thoroughly alternated to stimulate understanding,
   making relations, and extending the students' knowledge. The course
   organisation and main topics, as well as result analysis of student
   surveys are discussed. The survey results and feedback from the
   reference group indicate that the course organisation and topics are
   effective and helpful for students.},

Title = {Evaluation of Usage of Virtual Microscopy for the Study of Histology in

Abstract = {This article describes the introduction of a virtual microscope (VM)
   that has allowed preclinical histology teaching to be fashioned to
   better suit the needs of approximately 900 undergraduate students per
   year studying medicine, dentistry, or veterinary science at the
   University of Bristol, United Kingdom. Features of the VM implementation
   include: (1) the facility for students and teachers to make annotations
   on the digital slides; (2) in-house development of VM-based quizzes that
   are used for both formative and summative assessments; (3) archiving of
   teaching materials generated each year, enabling students to access
   their personalized learning resources throughout their programs; and (4)
   retention of light microscopy capability alongside the VM. Student
   feedback on the VM is particularly positive about its ease of use, the
   value of the annotation tool, the quizzes, and the accessibility of all
   components off-campus. Analysis of login data indicates considerable,
   although variable, use of the VM by students outside timetabled
   teaching. The median number of annual logins per student account for
   every course exceeded the number of timetabled histology classes for
   that course (1.6-3.5 times). The total number of annual student logins
   across all cohorts increased from approximately 9,000 in the year
   2007-2008 to 22,000 in the year 2010-2011. The implementation of the VM
   has improved teaching and learning in practical classes within the
   histology laboratory and facilitated consolidation and revision of
   material outside the laboratory. Discussion is provided of some novel
   strategies that capitalize on the benefits of introducing a VM, as well
   as strategies adopted to overcome some potential challenges. (C) 2013

Abstract = {This paper presents a pedagogical method to enhance teaching and
   learning in linear algebra in engineering courses. The teaching method
   Peer Instruction combined to seminar strategy, and supported by the
   Didactical Engineering methodology, is proposed to contribute in
   understanding abstract concepts and encouraging research and
   problem-solving creativity. The method was performed in the linear
   algebra course in the undergraduate Chemical Engineering program at the
   Federal University of Ceara, Brazil. Student evaluation was performed
   continuously throughout the course, including exams connected to the
   concepts taught, quizzes linked to the end of each unit, reading
   assignments linked to the Peer Instruction method, and oral presentation
   with written record related to the seminar method. To investigate
   students opinion of the proposal methodology and assessment method, the
   questionnaire Students' Evaluation of Educational Quality was conducted
   at the final third of the course. The results indicate that the teaching
   strategy contributed to improve students' understanding of the abstract
   concepts and to develop collaborative and significant learning.},

Abstract = {Pair programming is an approach where two programmers work to solve one
   programming problem sitting shoulder to shoulder on a computer. Several
   studies indicating numerous benefits of using pair programming as a
   teaching strategy exist. However, only a few of them take into
   consideration the mechanism followed for pair formation. With an aim to
   study the impact of pair programming on undergraduate students, we try
   to make the pairs compatible with a genetic algorithm-based approach.
   Using a genetic algorithm, the system ensures that every pair in the
   class gets a particular combination of skills and personality traits. We
   also developed a desktop application to assign programming exercises to
   students dynamically. To assess the efficacy of pair programming in
   introductory programming course, a formal pair programming experiment
   was run at Netaji Subhas University of Technology. The pair programming
   experiment involved a total 171 undergraduate students from a computer
   engineering course. At the end of the program, we assessed the
   programming abilities of every student. We also analyzed the impact of a
   genetic algorithm-based pairing mechanism. On the basis of assessments,
   it is observed that pair programming is a successful pedagogical tool
   for facilitating active learning of introductory programming courses.
   Responses to survey garnered from undergraduate students hint that the
   genetic algorithm approach leads to compatible pairs.},

Title = {Improving competence and safety in pain medicine: a practical clinical

Abstract = {BackgroundPain is a devastating sensation and has to be treated
   immediately. Therefore, we developed a training program to improve the
   knowledge of medical students in the field of pain medicine. In the
   present study, the applicability and efficacy of this training program
   was tested.MethodsHalf of the students attended first a training with
   simulated patients (SP) followed by bedside teaching (Group 1). Group 2
   performed the training programs in reverse order. The evaluation based
   on standardized questionnaires completed by students (self-assessment)
   and all students took part in two practical examinations after the
   learning interventions.ResultsThis study included 35 students. The
   quality of the simulation was evaluated by the students with average
   grade 1.1 (1=very good, 6=very bad). The practical work on the ward with
   patients was rated with grade 1.4 of 6, the whole course with 1.1.
   Students of Group A were significantly better in the final examination
   (grade 1.7 vs. grade 2.2, p<0.05). To rate the improvement of skills
   (self-assessment) we used a Likert Scale (1=very certain, 5=very
   uncertain). The following skills were similar in both groups and
   significantly better after the course: taking responsibility, expert
   knowledge, empathy, relationship building and
   communication.ConclusionsTraining with simulated patients in combination
   with small-group teaching at the bedside with real patients achieves a
   dramatic increase in student competence. Students prefer learning from
   the simulation before bedside teaching and propose to include simulation
   into the curricular teaching of pain medicine.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To understand the variability of surgical attending
   experience and perspectives regarding informed consent and how it
   impacts resident education
   DESIGN: A novel survey was distributed electronically to explore faculty
   surgeon's personal learning experience, knowledge, clinical practice,
   teaching preferences and beliefs regarding informed consent. Chi-square
   and Kruskal-Wallis testing was performed to look for associations and a
   cluster analysis was performed to elucidate additional patterns among.
   SETTING: Single, tertiary, university-affiliated health care system
   (Yale New Haven Health in Connecticut), including 6 teaching hospitals.
   PARTICIPANTS: Clinical faculty within the Department of Surgery.
   RESULTS: A total of 85 surgeons responded (49\% response rate),
   representing 17 specialties, both private practice and university and/or
   hospital-employed, with a range of years in practice. Across all ages,
   specialties, the most common method for both learning (86\%) and
   teaching (82\%) informed consent was observation of the attending.
   Respondents who stated they learned by observing attendings were more
   likely to report that they teach by having trainees observe them (OR
   8.5, 95\% CI 1.3-56.5) and participants who recalled learning by having
   attendings observe them were more likely to observe their trainees (OR
   4.1, 95\% CI 1.5-11.2).Cluster analysis revealed 5 different attending
   phenotypes with significant heterogeneity between groups. A cluster of
   younger attendings reported the least diverse learning experience and
   high levels of concern for legal liability and resident competency. They
   engaged in few strategies for teaching residents. By comparison, the
   cluster that reported the most diverse learning experience also reported
   the richest diversity of teaching strategies to residents but rarely
   allowed residents to perform consent with their patients. Meanwhile, 2
   other cluster provided a more balanced experience with some
   opportunities for practice with patients and some diversity of teaching
   - these clusters, respectively, consist of older, experienced general
   surgeons and surgeons in trauma and/or critical care.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgeon's demographics, personal experiences, and specialty
   appear to significantly influence their teaching styles and the
   educational experience residents receive regarding informed consent. (C)

Title = {A self-regulated flipped classroom approach to improving students'
   learning performance in a mathematics course},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom is a well-recognized learning mode that enables
   effective practice and interactions among teachers and students in the
   class by switching the in-class instructional time and out-of-class
   practicing time. However, owing to their lack of self regulated
   competence, most students might fail to browse and comprehend the
   instructional materials out of class by themselves. In this paper, a
   self-regulated flipped classroom approach is proposed to help students
   schedule their out-of-class time to effectively read and comprehend the
   learning content before class, such that they are capable of interacting
   with their peers and teachers in class for in-depth discussions. In
   order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a
   quasi-experimental design was employed in an elementary school
   Mathematics course. The experimental group students learned with the
   self-regulated flipped classroom approach, while the control group
   students learned with the conventional flipped classroom approach. The
   study was conducted using a quantitative approach. The instruments used
   were a performance test, and questionnaires of self-efficacy and
   self-regulation. The experimental results indicated that the post-test
   score of the experimental group was significantly higher than that of
   the control group. It was also found that the higher self-regulation
   students showed significantly different learning achievements when
   learning with different approaches, while there was no significant
   difference between lower self-regulation students with the different
   learning approaches. Moreover, the experimental group showed
   significantly higher self-efficacy than the control group. In addition,
   the learning log analysis results further showed that, conforming to the
   objective of the self-regulated strategy, the students would determine
   the goals for the next learning phase based on their current
   performance. To sum up, the findings of this study indicate that
   integrating the self-regulated strategy into flipped learning can
   improve students' self-efficacy as well as their strategies of planning
   and using study time, and hence they can learn effectively and have
   better learning achievements. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Investigating the impact of a flipped programming course using the
   DT-CDIO approach},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {173},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Currently, flipped learning requires a framework that will give novices
   and students the ability to face the complex problems encountered in
   programming courses. It is necessary to design a design thinking
   learning framework that addresses independent learning and specific
   processes that will improve students' 21st-century skills. The existing
   literature has not implemented flipped programming courses from a design
   thinking perspective (Cook \& Bush, 2018), which would thus be an
   innovative approach to designing teaching methods and investigating the
   effects of this framework. The purpose of this study was to develop
   analyze, observe, reflect, conceive, design, implement, and operate
   (Crawley et al., 2007) a DT-CDIO model and to investigate the
   relationship of the flow experience to computational thinking and
   cognitive load in order to understand the impact of the flow experience
   on a flipped programming course. The participants in this study
   comprised 40 pre-service education students (Male = 17; Female = 23).
   The partial least squares (PLS) method was used for the data analysis to
   test the model. This study was intended to obtain and evaluate
   significant differences between the students' flow experience and their
   computational thinking ability and cognitive load. The results indicated
   that the DT-CDIO pedagogy filled a long-standing gap related to a lack
   of reflective pedagogy and design thinking problems. The flow experience
   negatively impacted creativity and problem solving ability. Meanwhile,
   intrinsic cognitive load negatively impacted the flow experience.
   Germane cognitive load positively impacted the flow experience. In
   particular, the flow experience is a crucial factor that can be used to
   predict various computational thinking skills in a programming
   curriculum. More importantly, this study provides important insights
   into the implications of the DT-CDIO approach and other related factors.},

Abstract = {Objective. To examine the Qatar University Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD)
   program for evidence of incorporation of communities of practice (CoP)
   learning theory.
   Methods. A developed CoP framework was used as a theoretical instrument
   to analyze the evidence of CoP theory in QU PharmD program, utilizing a
   case study research approach.
   Results. The research suggests that the evidence of the CoP framework in
   the PharmD program falls into three categories. The first category
   represents elements of CoP that were fully evident, such as knowledge
   recontextualization, social and professional acceptance, and effective
   assessment measures. The second category represents elements that were
   partially evident, such as the formation of a co-development team,
   informal learning, mentoring strategies, and preceptors' orientation to
   assessment. The third category represents elements that were not
   evident, such as collaboration between faculty and preceptors and
   ensuring the reliability and validity of assessment tools. In cases
   where elements of CoP were implemented, this was an implicit rather than
   explicit application of CoP theory. Therefore, it was theorized that the
   disconnect between CoP learning theory and educational practices is at
   the ``implicit disconnect{''} level.
   Conclusion. This research indicates that the CoP framework facilitated
   the identification of areas for future quality improvement and suggests
   that the theoretical CoP framework could be used by other programs to
   identify areas for improvements. We theorize that a full and explicit
   implementation of learning theory into educational practices is crucial,
   which calls for the collaboration of academic, practice, accreditation,
   and governmental sectors in pharmacy educational reform initiatives.},

Abstract = {The recent emergence and subsequent global spread of COVID-19 has forced
   a rapid shift to online and remote learning at veterinary schools.
   Students in a Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine program were taught using
   a real-time online platform for one semester, with recorded synchronous
   lectures and tutorials, virtual laboratories, and clinical skills
   classes where possible. Students in all years of the program were
   surveyed twice, 8 weeks apart to assess their perceptions of online
   teaching and to identify challenges they experienced. Using a 10-point
   Likert scale, students agreed that they could achieve their learning
   outcomes using online learning with no more difficulty than with
   face-to-face teaching, allocating average scores of 7.6 and 8.2 at each
   time point. Students were overwhelmingly positive about the impact of
   online teaching on time-management of their learning due to the loss of
   travel time. They enjoyed aspects of teaching such as recorded lectures,
   online polls quizzes, and chat boxes that allowed more student-focused
   learning. However, there were concerns about the reduction in
   face-to-face interactions including loss of classroom atmosphere and
   reduced interaction with peers. Students experienced technical problems
   in a median of 20\% of lectures (range 10\%-50\%) at the first survey
   and 10\% at the second (range 10\%-50\%). Increased use of strategies to
   optimize peer interactions is recommended to facilitate student learning
   using online platforms. Moving forward beyond the pandemic, allowing
   flexible time management and a shift toward student-centered learning
   using strategies such as flipped classrooms may be beneficial.},

Abstract = {Objective. To integrate a blended-learning model into a two-course
   patient assessment sequence in a doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) program and
   to assess the academic performance and perceptions of enrolled students.
   Design. A blended-learning model consisting of a flipped classroom
   format was integrated into a patient assessment (PA) course sequence.
   Course grades of students in the blended-learning (intervention) and
   traditional-classroom (control) groups were compared. A survey was
   administered to assess student perceptions.
   Assessment. The mean numeric grades of students in the intervention
   group were higher than those of students in the traditional group (PA1
   course: 92.2 +/- 3.1 vs 90.0 +/- 4.3; and PA2 course: 90.3 +/- 4.9 vs
   85.8 +/- 4.2). Eighty-six percent of the students in the intervention
   group agreed that the instructional methodologies used in this course
   facilitated understanding of the material.
   Conclusion. The blended-learning model was associated with improved
   academic performance and was well-received by students.},

Title = {Visual programming languages integrated across the curriculum in
   elementary school: A two year case study using ``Scratch{''} in five
   schools},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Several authors and studies highlight the benefits of the integration of
   Computer Science into K-12 education. Applications such as Scratch have
   been demonstrated to be effective in educational environments. The aim
   of this study is to assess the use of a Visual Programming Language
   using Scratch in classroom practice, analyzing the outcomes and
   attitudes of 107 primary school students from 5th to 6th grade in five
   different schools in Spain. The intervention takes place in two academic
   years analyzing the practice of integrating coding and visual blocks
   programming in sciences and arts. The ``Computational concepts and
   computational practices{''} dimension details a quasi-experimental
   approach, which showed significant improvement regarding learning
   programming concepts, logic, and computational practices with an active
   approach. The ``Learning processes and coding in primary education{''}
   dimension analyzes the practice of the experimental group through
   questionnaires and structured observation. In this pedagogical design,
   students interact and create their own content related to curricular
   areas with several advantages, such as motivation, fun, commitment, and
   enthusiasm, showing improvements related to computational thinking and
   computational practices. Understanding of computational concepts through
   an active approach, Project Based Learning, usefulness, motivation, and
   commitment underline the importance and effectiveness of implementing a
   Visual Programming Language from active methodologies in primary
   education. Due to the aforementioned benefits and positive results
   obtained in this research, it is recommended to implement a Visual
   Programming Language in educational settings in 5th and 6th grade in
   primary education through a cross-curricular implementation. (C) 2016

Title = {Lessons Learned from Online Teaching and Their Implications for
   Students' Future Careers: Combined PLS-SEM and IPA Approach},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},

Abstract = {As far as students are concerned, there is a well-founded relationship
   between academic performance and career management from which a special
   professional path can result, based on the multitude of knowledge,
   skills, and experiences acquired during the years of study. To this end,
   the presence and help of teachers participating in the learning process,
   the teaching activities they are involved in, and their own
   participation are determinant factors. This research aims to highlight
   the impact that the above factors have on the professional future of
   students. For this purpose, 395 respondents, including students in the
   bachelor's and master's cycles, were involved in the research process,
   to whom a questionnaire was given in electronic format during two
   stages: one where the didactic activity was carried out in online format
   and the other carried out face-to-face. Hypotheses testing was performed
   using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The present
   study focuses on two main directions regarding the results obtained.
   Thus, with respect to the acquisition of knowledge and the development
   of student skills, it emerged that the effect of the content in the
   didactic activities on student skills and the development of
   competencies is strengthened by the skills and degree of involvement of
   the teaching staff from the university environment. Related to the
   management of students' careers, the analysis showed that the effect of
   the content in didactic activities is complemented by the accumulation
   of knowledge and the formation of student skills. The rigorous economic
   training resulting from didactic activities constitutes a main pillar in
   the students' future, even more so depending on how much they perceive
   that the topics covered in the university courses are of interest to
   them. The results of this study can serve as theoretical support for
   future research that addresses the topic of student career management
   and the implications of university activities on knowledge and skills.
   In addition, the results can support decisions for the management of
   higher education institutions regarding the development and
   implementation of university programs and educational strategies with
   the aim of increasing the involvement of teachers and students in the
   teaching-learning process.},

Abstract = {Computing and computers are introduced in school as important examples
   of technology, sometimes as a subject matter of their own, and sometimes
   they are used as tools for other subjects. All in all, one might even
   say that learning about computing and computers is part of learning
   about technology. Lately, many countries have implemented programming in
   their curricula as a means to address society's dependence on, and need
   for programming knowledge and code. Programming is a fairly new school
   subject without educational traditions and, due to the rapid
   technological development, in constant change. This means that most
   programming teachers must decide for themselves what and how to teach.
   In this study, programming teachers' teaching is studied. With the aim
   of exploring the connection/possible gap between teacher's intentions
   and the teacher's instructional practice, an expansion of the conceptual
   apparatus of phenomenography and variation theory is tested. In the
   article, phenomenography and variation theory and the suggested
   supplementary theoretical tool (Georg Henrik von Wright's model of logic
   of events) are briefly presented and then deployed upon one selected
   case. Findings reveal that teachers' intentions (reflected in their
   actions) include an emphasis (of teachers' side) on the importance of
   balancing theory and practice, using different learning strategies,
   encouraging learning by trial-and-error and fostering collaboration
   between students for a deeper understanding of concepts. In conclusion,
   logic of events interpretations proves to be useful as a complementary
   tool to the conceptual apparatus of phenomenography.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Computational thinking (CT), a way to think about solving problems, is
   recognized as a basic skill for the 21st century. Although game-based
   learning (GBL) has been shown to improve student's CT skills, students
   may fail to self-evaluate or debate as they play games, thus failing to
   develop higher-order thinking. Also not widely explored is how teachers
   are to practice the CT core competencies during the learning process to
   cultivate students' problem-solving thinking. As the adoption of
   student-generated questions (SGQ) is an instructional strategy to
   promote higherorder thinking, we develop a GBL platform that uses this
   strategy to enhance students' CT skills, learning motivation, and
   learning confidence. For this purpose, fifty-three primary school
   students were recruited for this study, and data were collected during
   four classes of experimental CT activities. This study shows that the
   experimental group using the SGQ strategy with a GBL platform exhibited
   significantly higher CT skills than the control group. In addition, with
   respect to learning motivation and learning confidence it is found that
   the experimental group also outperformed the control group. This
   confirms that integrating the SGQ strategy and CT core competencies
   fosters higher-order cognitive thinking in students in problem-solving
   through gamification of the learning environment, resulting in higher
   motivation and confidence to complete experimental activities.},

   and Coping Strategies},

Abstract = {The ability to program in R, an open-source statistical program, is
   increasingly valued across job markets, including ecology. The benefits
   of teaching R to undergraduates are abundant, but learning to code in R
   may induce anxiety for students, potentially leading to negative
   learning outcomes and disengagement. Anecdotes suggest a gender
   differential in programming anxiety, with women experiencing greater
   anxiety. Currently, we do not know the extent to which programming
   anxiety exists in our undergraduate biology classrooms, whether it
   differs by gender, and what instructors can do to alleviate it.
   Instructor immediacy has been shown to mediate related anxieties such as
   quantitative and computer anxiety. Likewise, students' use of adaptive
   coping strategies may mitigate anxieties. We investigated students' R
   anxiety within a lower-division ecology course and explored its
   relationships with gender, instructor immediacy, classroom engagement,
   and reported coping strategies. Women reported significantly higher R
   anxiety than men, a gap that narrowed, yet persisted over the semester.
   In addition, several specific coping skills were associated with
   decreases in R anxiety and increases in self-concept and sense of
   control; these differed by gender identity. Our findings can guide
   future work to identify interventions that lessen programming anxiety in
   biology classes, especially for women.},

Title = {Didactic Strategy for the Teaching of Isotope Mixing Models for Stable
   Isotopes Relevant to Biogeochemistry Based on the Analogy with Color
   Composition},

Abstract = {The continuous advances in mass spectrometry techniques have pushed
   forward the frontiers of all branches of the isotope biogeochemistry
   field. In environmental studies, different isotope ratios as determined
   in different reservoirs offer the opportunity, for example, to identify
   pollution sources and to trace metal fluxes within the trophic web and
   in dietary studies. Despite its relevance, trace metal isotope
   biogeochemistry is infrequently taught in undergraduate courses because
   it demands a rather high level of complexity of teaching strategies and
   abstraction capacity from students. Additionally, available didactic
   material for introducing mixing source modeling with stable isotopes
   relevant to biogeochemistry is scarce. In this context, the present
   study applies a visually appealing didactic strategy based on the
   analogy between colors (analog domain) and isotopic compositions (target
   domain), in order to encourage and assist the teaching-learning
   processes of this new subject in environmental science and chemistry
   classes. We demonstrate how familiar and simple concepts can be applied
   for introducing challenging subjects. In a setting that restricts
   inperson academic activities such as during a pandemic, the development
   of appealing visual approaches is imperative to engage students during
   online classes. The didactic strategy proposed herein was put to the
   test during remotely taught classes on the topic of ``Environmental
   Impact Assessment Methodology{''} (winter 2021, 18 students) and
   ``Environmental Contamination{''} (summer 2020, 18 students, and winter
   2021, 20 students) of the Postgraduate Program in Geochemistry at the
   Fluminense Federal University (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Students'
   feedback was very positive; they found our approach stimulating, and it
   helped them to better visualize, understand, and interpret the targeted
   learning outcomes.},

Title = {Assessment of two e-learning methods teaching undergraduate students
   cephalometry in orthodontics},

Abstract = {AimCephalometry is important for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment
   planning and is part of the core curriculum for training dentists.
   Training involves identifying anatomical landmarks. The aim of this
   investigation was to assess whether e-learning improves learning
   efficiency; a programme specifically designed for this purpose was
   compared to commercially available software.
   MethodsThirty undergraduate students underwent traditional training of
   cephalometry consisting of lectures and tutorials. Tracing skills were
   tested immediately afterwards (T0). The students were then randomly
   allocated to three groups: 10 students served as control (CF); they were
   asked to improve their skills using the material provided so far. Ten
   students were given a program specifically designed for this study that
   was based on a power point presentation (PPT). The last group was given
   a commercially available program that included teaching elements (SW).
   The groups were tested at the end the sixweek training (T1). The test
   consisted of tracing 30 points on two radiographs and a point score
   improvement was calculated. The students were interviewed after the
   second test.
   ResultsBoth e-learning groups improved more than the traditional group.
   Improvement scores were four for CF; 8.6 for PPT and 2.8 for SW. For PPT
   all participants improved and the student feedback was the best compared
   to the other groups. For the other groups some candidates worsened.
   ConclusionsBlended learning produced better learning outcomes compared
   to using a traditional teaching method alone. The easy to use Power
   Point based custom software produced better results than the
   commercially available software.},

Title = {Health literacy training program for community healthcare providers
   using hybrid online team-based learning in Taiwan},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Background Health literacy (HL) has proven to be a determining factor
   influencing the health of individuals. Community health providers (CHPs)
   work on the front line of improving public HL. Increasing their
   understanding of HL and their ability to incorporate HL into healthcare
   can reduce obstacles in healthcare services. This study evaluated the
   effectiveness of an HL training program for CHP by using the hybrid
   online team-based learning (TBL) model. Methods A quasi-experimental
   study and focused group interviews were conducted. We developed a six
   weeks HL online course for CHPs. The program included teaching videos
   for pre-class preparation, a 90-min online TBL model, and a case
   discussion in the last two weeks. Team application activities were
   designed for each class to enhance knowledge application. A total of 81
   CHPs from 20 public health centers took the course and provided complete
   data for analysis. Learning effectiveness was evaluated based on the
   familiarity, attitude, and confidence in implementing HL practices,
   course satisfaction, and participants' learning experiences. Results The
   comparison showed that the participants' familiarity with HL (4.29 +/-
   1.76 vs 6.92 +/- 1.52, p < .001), attitude (7.39 +/- 1.88 vs 8.10 +/-
   1.44, p = .004), and confidence in implementing HL practices (6.22 +/-
   1.48 vs 7.61 +/- 1.34, p < .001) increased after the course. The average
   satisfaction with the teaching strategies was 4.06 +/- .53 points, the
   average helpfulness to practice was 4.13 +/- .55 points, and the overall
   feedback on satisfaction with learning was 4.06 +/- .58 points (the full
   score was 5 points). According to the learning experience of the 20
   participants in the focus group discussion, the experiences of teaching
   strategies and the learning experiences of the HL course were summed up
   into two categories, seven themes, and 13 subthemes. The results showed
   a positive experience with the hybrid online TBL program. Conclusion The
   use of hybrid online TBL model is a feasible and valid approach for the

Abstract = {To ensure that the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
   (STEM) workforce of the future is inclusive of diverse peoples and
   ideas, there is a need to ensure that STEM outreach activities that
   encourage students into STEM education and careers are inclusive of and
   provide equity for people from diverse racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and
   academic backgrounds. Since 2004, the National Indigenous Science
   Education Program (NISEP), based at Macquarie University, Sydney, has
   been using best ethical and inclusion strategies to engage with
   Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander school students and
   their communities. This publication discusses the inclusion and equity
   strategies utilized by NISEP, including community consultation, student
   leadership and autonomy, volunteer mentors, and the respectful and best
   practice use of Indigenous knowledge. These factors have all contributed
   to NISEP's success in increasing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
   students' aspiration toward and engagement with secondary and tertiary
   education.},

Abstract = {Members of the Education Committee of the Brazilian Society of
   Physiology have developed multiple outreach models to improve the
   appreciation of science and physiology at the precollege level. The
   members of this committee act in concert with important Brazilian
   governmental strategies to promote training of undergraduate students in
   the teaching environment of secondary and high schools. One of these
   governmental strategies, the Programa Institucional de Bolsas de
   Iniciacao a` Docencia, a Brazilian public policy of teaching enhancement
   implemented by the Coorde-nacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel
   Superior (CAPES) since 2007, represents a well-articulated public policy
   that can promote the partnership between University and Schools (7).
   Furthermore, the Program ``Novos Talentos{''} (New
   Talents)/CAPES/Ministry of Education is another government initiative to
   bring together university and high-level technical training with the
   reality of Brazilian schools. Linked to the New Talents Program, in
   partnership with the British Council/Newton Fund, CAPES recently
   promoted the visit of some university professors that coordinate New
   Talents projects to formal and informal educational science spaces in
   the United Kingdom (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics,
   BrazilUnited King-dom International Cooperation Program) to qualify the
   actions developed in this area in Brazil, and one of us had the
   opportunity to participate with this.},

Title = {Unanticipated Teaching Demands Rise with Simulation Training: Strategies
   for Managing Faculty Workload},

Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Using simulation to teach and assess learners represents a
   powerful approach to training, but one that comes with hidden costs in
   terms of faculty time, even if programs adopt existing curricula. Some
   simulators are built to be used independently by learners, but much of
   the surgical simulation curricula developed for cognitive and
   psychomotor tasks requires active faculty involvement and low
   learner-to-faculty teaching ratios to ensure sufficient practice with
   feedback. The authors hypothesize that the added teaching demands
   related to simulation have resulted in a significant financial burden to
   surgery training programs. To date, the effect of simulation-based
   training on faculty workload has not been estimated objectively and
   reported in the literature.
   METHODS: To test their hypothesis, the authors analyzed data from 2
   sources: (1) changes over time (2006-2014) in formal teaching hours and
   estimated faculty costs at the University of Minnesota, General Surgery
   Department and (2) a 2014 online survey of general surgery program
   directors on their use of simulation for teaching and assessment and
   their perceptions of workload effects.
   RESULTS: At the University of Minnesota, the total number of hours spent
   by department faculty in resident and student simulation events
   increased from 81 in annual year 2006 to 365 in annual year 2013.
   Estimated full-time equivalent faculty costs rose by 350\% during the
   same period. Program directors (n = 48) of Association of Program
   Directors in Surgery reported either a slight (60\%) or a significant
   (33\%) increase in faculty workload with the advent of simulation, and
   moderate difficulty in finding enough instructors to meet this increase.
   Calling upon leadership for support, using diverse instructor types, and
   relying on ``the dedicated few{''} represent the most common strategies.
   CONCLUSION: To avoid faculty burnout and successfully sustain faculty
   investment in simulation-based training over time, programs need to be
   creative in building, sustaining, and managing the instructor workforce.

Abstract = {In this article, a Matlab-based software environment called Guide Silo
   Design (GSD) is proposed to help undergraduate students to better
   understand the complex phenomena involved in the analysis process of
   silo structures. The software is integrated with two commercial finite
   element softwares. These are the Open Application Programming Interface
   (OAPI) code in SAP2000 and the ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL)
   code in ANSYS. GSD allows civil engineering students to create a virtual
   simulation environment in which an effective and appropriate
   teaching-learning process can be experienced. The GSD environment is
   programmed in Matlab using a finite element-based mathematical
   framework. Furthermore, as the analysis of silo structures is highly
   relevant in real engineering projects, students can acquire fundamental
   knowledge for their future works as engineers. The present interactive
   virtual environment has great potential to improve the learning process
   of the analysis of silo structures.},

Abstract = {Although there are different types of software resources-which in many

   effective tool that improves the learning of thermodynamics and the
   understanding of real thermodynamic cycles. In the present paper, an
   original programming procedure to improve the learning process of Marine
   Engineering students at the University of A Coruna (UDC) is shown. In
   particular, to test this learning procedure, an Operator Training
   Simulator is done by 117 students by the fusion of the contents of two
   subjects of the ``Degree in Marine Technologies{''} of the UDC. The main
   advantage that this personalized simulator presents is confronting
   problems derived from equipment operation, thereby proving the necessary
   knowledge in operation based on the thermodynamic phenomena. The results
   showed that students who were trained with simulators showed a better

Title = {Perceptions of the use of intelligent information access systems in
   university level active learning activities among teachers of biomedical
   subjects},

Abstract = {Background: Student participation and the use of active methodologies in
   classroom learning are being increasingly emphasized. The use of
   intelligent systems can be of great help when designing and developing
   these types of activities. Recently, emerging disciplines such as
   `educational data mining' and `learning analytics and knowledge' have
   provided clear examples of the importance of the use of artificial
   intelligence techniques in education.
   Objective: The main objective of this study was to gather expert
   opinions regarding the benefits of using complementary methods that are
   supported by intelligent systems, specifically, by intelligent
   information access systems, when processing texts written in natural
   language and the benefits of using these methods as companion tools to
   the learning activities that are employed by biomedical and health
   sciences teachers.
   Methods: Eleven teachers of degree courses who belonged to the Faculties
   of Biomedical Sciences (BS) and Health Sciences (HS) of a Spanish
   university in Madrid were individually interviewed. These interviews
   were conducted using a mixed methods questionnaire that included 66
   predefined close-ended and open-ended questions. In our study, three
   intelligent information access systems (i.e., BioAnnote, CLEiM and
   MedCMap) were successfully used to evaluate the teacher's perceptions
   regarding the utility of these systems and their different methods in
   learning activities.
   Results: All teachers reported using active learning methods in the
   classroom, most of which were computer programs that were used for
   initially designing and later executing learning activities. All
   teachers used case-based learning methods in the classroom, with a
   specific emphasis on case reports written in Spanish and/or English. In
   general, few or none of the teachers were familiar with the technical
   terms related to the technologies used for these activities such as
   ``intelligent systems{''} or ``concept/mental maps{''}. However, they
   clearly realized the potential applicability of such approaches in both
   the preparation and the effective use of these activities in the
   classroom. Specifically, the themes highlighted by a greater number of
   teachers after analyzing the responses to the open-ended questions were
   the usefulness of BioAnnote system to provide reliable sources of
   medical information and the usefulness of the bilingual nature of CLEiM
   system for learning medical terminology in English.
   Conclusions: Three intelligent information access systems were
   successfully used to evaluate the teacher's perceptions regarding the
   utility of these systems in learning activities. The results of this
   study showed that integration of reliable sources of information,
   bilingualism and selective annotation of concepts were the most valued
   features by the teachers, who also considered the incorporation of these
   systems into learning activities to be potentially very useful. In
   addition, in the context of our experimental conditions, our work
   provides useful insights into the way to appropriately integrate this
   type of intelligent information access systems into learning activities,

Abstract = {Problem: Faculty in the Division of Hospital Medicine provide most of
   the clinical teaching for learners at our institution. The majority of
   these faculty are Assistant Professors with limited formal instruction
   in clinical teaching. Previous Divisional strategies to improve clinical
   teaching ability included discussion of effective teaching behaviors,
   developing written expectations for teaching faculty, and instituting
   seminars on effective clinical teaching. Heretofore, the Division had
   not utilized a direct observation exercise. Intervention: We developed a
   direct observation exercise to encourage discussion of teaching
   techniques and contemplation of change. Using a social learning model,
   we developed a peer-to-peer observation followed by a nonevaluative
   discussion. We created a tool for describing teaching behaviors in 5
   domains that were similar to or different from the usual behavior of the
   observing peer: learner presentations, team leadership, bedside
   teaching, professionalism, and other. After the observation, the
   observing and observed faculty met to discuss observed teaching
   behaviors. Both faculty members discussed and then recorded any teaching
   behaviors that they planned to adopt or change. Context: We implemented
   this intervention in a 22-member Academic Division of Hospital Medicine
   at a tertiary care medical center in the United States. A high
   proportion were junior faculty and graduates of our residency program.
   Outcome: We reviewed records of 28 of 31 observations that were
   completed during the initial 9-month period of implementation and later
   surveyed faculty. The exercise resulted in planned changes in teaching
   behaviors that included instituting new methods to improve teaching team
   leadership, triaging of patients seen on rounds, faculty behaviors
   during oral presentations, giving real-time feedback, use of technology
   and humor, demonstrating physical examination findings, and modeling
   professional behaviors. Faculty later reported adoption of new teaching
   behaviors that were important to them. Lessons Learned: This exercise
   was easily implemented, resulted in planned changes by both observed and
   observing peers, and resulted in widespread adoption of some specific
   teaching behaviors. The most commonly planned change dealt with team
   leadership or organizational issues. When given the freedom to choose,
   junior faculty were more likely to observe senior faculty.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to evaluate a teaching strategy designed to
   teach first-year undergraduate life sciences students at a research
   university how to learn to read authentic research articles. Our
   approach-based on the work done in the field of genre analysis and
   argumentation theory-means that we teach students to read research
   articles by teaching them which rhetorical moves occur in research
   articles and how they can identify these. Because research articles are
   persuasive by their very nature, we focused on the rhetorical moves that
   play an important role in authors' arguments. We designed a teaching
   strategy using cognitive apprenticeship as the pedagogical approach. It
   was implemented in a first-year compulsory course in the life sciences
   undergraduate program. Comparison of the results of a pretest with those
   of the posttest showed that students' ability to identify these moves
   had improved. Moreover, students themselves had also perceived that
   their ability to read and understand a research article had increased.
   The students' evaluations demonstrated that they appreciated the
   pedagogical approach used and experienced the assignments as useful. On
   the basis of our results, we concluded that students had taken a first
   step toward becoming expert readers.},

Title = {The micro revolution: effect of Bite-Sized Teaching (BST) on learner
   engagement and learning in postgraduate medical education},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {ContextBite-sized learning is an instructional method that utilizes
   brief, focused learning units. This approach may be beneficial in
   medical education given demands on learner time and cognitive load. This
   study aims to assess the impact of this approach on knowledge
   acquisition and learner attitudes in postgraduate medical
   education.MethodsAn instructional method, termed Bite-Sized Teaching
   (BST), was implemented within the curriculum at a US Internal Medicine
   postgraduate training program. In BST, content is distilled into
   manageable units focused on relevant schemas and delivered via brief
   peer teaching. A two-fold assessment of BST was performed that included
   cross sectional survey to assess learner attitudes and experiences and a
   controlled study to assess knowledge acquisition with BST and case-based
   teaching control.ResultsOne hundred and six of 171 residents (62\%
   response rate) completed the survey. Most residents (79.8\%) reported
   BST was among the best conference types in the curriculum. Important
   components of BST cited by residents include the distilled content,
   multiple short talk format and peer teaching. Residents report
   incorporating what they learned via BST into their teaching (76.1\%) and
   clinical practice (74.1\%). Resident who had participated as speaker
   were significantly more likely to report incorporating learning from BST
   into their teaching (87.2\% vs 63.0\%, p <0.01, Cramer's V effect size =
   0.37) and clinical practice (89.7\% vs 65.3\%, p = 0.02, Cramer's V
   effect size 0.28).Fifty-one residents participated in the knowledge
   assessment. Residents taught via BST scored significantly higher on
   immediate post-test compared to case-based teaching (score {[}SE] 62.5\%
   {[}1.9] vs 55.2\% {[}2.4], p = 0.03, Hedges g effect size 0.66). While
   both groups improved over pretest, there was no significant difference
   in scores between BST and case-based teaching at two (score {[}SE] 57.1
   {[}2.1] vs 54.8 {[}2.5], p = 0.54) and six weeks (score {[}SD] 55.9
   {[}2.1] vs 53.0 {[}2.9], p = 0.43).ConclusionsTeaching via brief,
   focused learning units delivered by peers is well received by learners
   and appears to have a significantly greater impact on immediate
   knowledge recall than case-based teaching. Further study on long term
   knowledge retention and behaviors is needed. Bite-Sized Teaching may be
   a promising instructional approach in medical education.},

Abstract = {There has been little attention given to teaching beliefs of graduate
   teaching assistants (GTAs), even though they represent the primary
   teaching workforce for undergraduate students in discussion and
   laboratory sections at many research universities. Secondary school
   education studies have shown that teaching beliefs are malleable and can
   be shaped by professional development, particularly for inexperienced
   teachers. This study characterized inexperienced GTAs' teaching beliefs
   about student learning and how they change with a science-specific
   pedagogy course that emphasized student learning. GTA teaching beliefs
   were characterized as traditional (providing information to students),
   instructive (providing activities for students), and transitional
   (focusing on student-teacher relationships). At the start of the course,
   traditional, instructive, and transitional beliefs were emphasized
   comparably in the concept maps and presentations of inexperienced GTAs.
   At the end of the course, although GTAs' beliefs remained mostly teacher
   focused, they were more instructive than traditional or transitional.
   GTAs included teaching strategies and jargon from the course in their
   concept maps but provided minimal explanations about how opportunities
   for active student engagement would impact student learning. These
   results suggest there is a need to provide ongoing discipline-specific
   professional development to inexperienced GTAs as they develop and
   strengthen their teaching beliefs about student learning.},

Abstract = {Flipped classroom is a new blended type of pedagogy. This study attempts
   to examine whether flipped classroom, with reference to self-regulation
   principles, is a good pedagogy for enhancing formative learning outcomes
   for first year university students. A total of 73 students, enrolled on
   a teacher education program, participated in this study. Data were
   collected from different sources in three phases. In the first phase,
   data were collected from pre- and post-tests, and the number of viewings
   of the assigned online videos were logged. Techniques in editing images
   applied by the group and the individual were examined in the second
   phase. Finally, opinions related to flipped classroom were collected
   from focus group interviews in the third phase. The results suggest that
   students are able to apply their self-learned knowledge to editing
   images both together and individually. They were very positive about
   flipped classroom activities and all 7 self-regulated (SR) learning
   principles were achieved. While students embraced the flexibility of
   learning online, they missed the face-to-face interaction with the
   teacher and their learning peers. This was especially the case when they
   did not understand the content of the online videos. This study provides
   an additional lens of SR principles.},

Title = {Frontline learning of medical teaching: ``you pick up as you go through
   work and practice{''}},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {SEP 19},
Abstract = {Background: Few medical teachers have received formal teaching
   education. Along with individual and organizational barriers to
   participation in teacher training programs, increasing numbers and
   altered distribution of physicians away from major teaching centers have
   increased the difficulty of attendance. Furthermore, it is not known if
   traditional faculty development formats are the optimal learning options
   given findings from existing studies document both positive and negative
   outcomes. There is a gap in research that explores how medical teachers
   learn to teach and also limited research regarding how medical teachers
   actually teach. The purpose of this study was to provide insight into
   how physicians describe their teaching of trainees, and the nature of
   their teaching development and improvement to inform faculty development
   programs.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 36 physicians,
   with a broad range of teaching experience, purposefully selected from
   five disciplines: Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, Surgery,
   and Family Medicine. A qualitative, inductive approach was used to
   analyse the data.
   Results: Teaching was described as being centered on the needs of
   individual trainees, but was dependent on patient presentation and
   environmental context. For this group of physicians learning to teach
   was perceived as a dynamic and evolving process influenced by multiple
   life experiences. The physicians had not learnt to teach through formal
   education and then put that learning into practice, but had learnt to
   teach and improve their teaching through their trial and errors
   teaching. Life experiences unconnected with the medical environment
   contributed to their knowledge of teaching along with limited formal
   learning to teach experiences. Teaching practice was influenced by peers
   and trainees, feedback, and observation. The findings suggest these
   medical teachers learn to teach along a continuum largely through their
   teaching practice.
   Conclusion: The findings suggested that the participants' major resource
   for learning how to teach was informal experiential learning, both in
   and out of the workplace. This may have implications for faculty
   development strategies for medical teaching education.},

Title = {Effects of two computer-based interventions on reading comprehension:
   Does strategy instruction matter?},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {196},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Managing text information to answer questions is one of the most
   frequent reading activities. These reading situations, called
   task-oriented reading, are challenging for students since they require
   specific skills that extend beyond basic reading comprehension skills.
   This is especially -pronounced when deep comprehension is required.
   Although many computer-based interventions have focused on teaching
   strategies to foster text comprehension, the role of strategy
   instruction in task-oriented reading has not been examined. In this
   study, we aim to ascertain the efficacy of an intervention based on
   task-oriented reading strategy instruction (TuinLECweb), in both text
   -base and situation model levels of comprehension, comparing it with
   training based on question -answering practice (AutoLEC). Moreover, we
   analyzed students' use of the instructional com-ponents and resources of
   the programs and the relationship to their efficacy. One hundred and
   thirty pupils attending sixth grade participated in this experimental
   pre-post study. The inter-vention comprised eight sessions in which
   students followed the training on their computers in the classroom.
   Results show that participants in both conditions raised their reading
   scores; however, while students in AutoLEC training obtained higher
   textbase scores, students in the TuinLECweb condition improved their
   situation model performance. Besides, gain in reading comprehension was
   not related to either instructional components or resources. These
   findings highlight the key role of strategy instruction in fostering
   deep comprehension when employing computer-based interventions in
   task-oriented reading. Moreover, these results point out the needto
   analyze how students manage the instructional aids offered to them.},

Abstract = {Higher education faces the challenge of high student attrition, which is
   especially disconcerting if associated with low participation rates, as
   is the case in South Africa. Recently, the use of learning analytics has
   increased, enabling institutions to make data-informed decisions to
   improve teaching, learning, and student success. Most of the literature
   thus far has focused on ``at-risk{''} students. The aim of this paper is
   twofold: to use learning analytics to define a different group of
   students, termed the ``murky middle{''} (MM), early enough in the
   academic year to provide scope for targeted interventions; and to
   describe the learning strategies of successful students to guide the
   design of interventions aimed at improving the prospects of success for
   all students, especially those of the MM. We found that it was possible
   to identify the MM using demographic data that are available at the
   start of the academic year. The students in the subgroup were cleanly
   defined by their grade 12 results for physical sciences. We were also
   able to describe the learning strategies that are associated with
   success in first-year biology. This information is useful for curricular
   design, classroom practice, and student advising and should be
   incorporated in professional development programs for lecturers and
   student advisors.},

Title = {Accessing online learning material: Quantitative behavior patterns and
   their effects on motivation and learning performance},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {286-297},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Accessing learning materials, that is, lecture slides, video lectures,
   shared assignments, and forum messages, is the most frequently performed
   online learning activity. However, students with different purposes,
   motivations, and preferences may exhibit different behaviors when
   accessing these materials. These different behaviors may further affect
   their learning performance. This study analyzed system logs recorded by
   a Learning Management System in which 59 computer science students
   participated in a blended learning course to learn mobile phone
   programming. The results revealed several significant findings. First,
   the students viewed the learning materials related to their classroom
   lectures (i.e., lecture slides and video lectures) for longer and more
   often than other learning materials (i.e., shared assignments and posted
   messages). Second, although the students spent a great deal of time
   viewing the online learning materials, most did not use annotation
   tools. Third, students' viewing behaviors showed great variety and were
   clustered into three behavior patterns: ``consistent use students{''}
   who intensively used all of the learning materials, ``slide intensive
   use students{''} who intensively used the lecture slides, and ``less use
   students{''} who infrequently used any learning material. These
   different behavior patterns were also associated with their motivation
   and learning performance. The results are discussed, and several
   suggestions for teachers, researchers, and system designers are
   proposed. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {This exploratory study examines the impact of a collaborative inquiry-
   and design-based afterschool program on urban high school students'
   IT/STEM learning-using information technology (IT) within the context of
   science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The study used
   a mixed methods design, involving 77 participants within two cohort
   groups, each participating in an eighteen-month intervention period.
   Data were collected from the pre- and post-surveys, analysis of the
   participants' IT/STEM projects, external evaluation reports, and
   follow-up interviews. Findings indicate that the program had a
   significant impact on students' technology and IT/STEM skills, frequency
   of technology use, and understanding of IT use in STEM-oriented fields.
   Some degree of impact on attitude changes toward IT/STEM and career
   aspirations in these fields was also in evidence. The study demonstrates
   that IT/STEM experiences supported through technology-enhanced, inquiry-
   and design-based collaborative learning strategies have significant
   impact on urban high school students' IT/STEM learning. Effect of
   afterschool programs on attitude changes and IT/STEM-related career
   aspirations of urban high school students are recommended areas of
   further investigation.},

Abstract = {Should we teach in hybrid mode or fully online? We examine the teaching
   model's role (hybrid versus fully online) in the service-profit chain in
   higher education institutions using survey data from 93 faculty members
   and 366 students from three American universities. We find that faculty
   members' satisfaction and the MBA program expectations improve MBA
   word-of-mouth by enhancing the MBA quality, MBA value, class
   satisfaction, and MBA loyalty. Additionally, we discover that the hybrid
   teaching model more strongly reinforces this chain of effects than the
   fully online model. IT creates the integration of differential value
   into a hybrid teaching style.},

Title = {Integrating interprofessional electronic medical record teaching in
   preregistration healthcare degrees: A case study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS},

Abstract = {Background: Electronic medical record (EMR) adoption across healthcare
   necessitates a purposeful curriculum design to prepare graduates for the
   delivery of safe and effective patient care in digitally-enabled
   environments. Objective: To describe the design and development of an
   Interprofessional Electronic Medical Record (iEMR) subject that
   introduces healthcare students to its utility in clinical settings.
   Methods: A six-stage design-based educational research framework (Focus,
   Formulation, Contextualisation, Definition, Implementation, Evaluation)
   was used to instigate the iEMR design and development in nursing and
   five allied health graduate entry to practice (preregistration) degrees
   at an Australian university. Results: In the Focus process, the concept
   and interdisciplinary partnerships were developed. The Formulation
   process secured grant support for subject design and development,
   including a rapid literature review to accommodate various course and
   curriculum structures. Discipline-specific subject themes were created
   through the Contextualisation process. During the Definition process,
   learning objectives and content resources were built. The Implementation
   process describes the pilot implementation in the nursing program, where
   assessment tasks were refined, and interdisciplinary clinical case
   studies originated. Discussion: The design and development of an iEMR
   subject is underpinned by internal support for educational innovation
   and in alignment with digital health strategies in employer
   organisations. Identified barriers include faculty-level changes in
   strategic support for teaching innovation, managerial expectations of
   workload, the scope of work required by academics and learning
   designers, and the gap between the technology platform required to
   support online learning and the infrastructure needed to support
   simulated EMR use. A key discovery was the difficulty of finding EMR
   software, whether designed for teaching purposes or for clinical use,
   that could be adapted to meet the needs of this project. Conclusion: The
   lessons learned are relevant to educators and learning designers
   attempting a similar process. Issues remain surrounding the
   sustainability of the iEMR subject and maintaining academic
   responsibility for ongoing curriculum management.},

   a Community-Based Approach on an Open Platform},

Abstract = {To face contemporary problems, international engineers must be trained
   in advanced learning environments and with professional skills and
   knowledge. Sponsored by USAID (US Agency for International Development),
   the Build-IT (Building University-Industry Learning and Development
   through Innovation and Technology) program leverages the vast
   capabilities of the implementing partner from Arizona State University
   and plays a key role as an innovative pioneer in converging
   personalities from various fields. A well-educated engineer can
   contribute to the sustainable development of society. With the aim of
   building community-oriented education, an integrated strategy was
   proposed in which a problem-based learning method is investigated to
   apply technical knowledge. In accordance with this strategy, in our
   proposed method, students from Mechatronics Engineering first had to
   work together with other learners in the electronics, software, control
   automation, and mechanics fields, followed by the design of an open
   platform integrated multi-disciplinary approach. By collaborating with
   their peers in developing this hardware, students become better equipped
   with specialized knowledge. This process also allows students to feel
   confident in implementing their innovative thinking while still
   maintaining the core meaning of the instrument. One of the key benefits
   of this approach is that helping students overcome their problems
   concurrently enhances the engineer's function in the community despite
   missing some specialized skill sets. Based on experimental works using
   this open framework, the present approach demonstrates that pupils in
   our program have sufficient ability to contribute to social
   achievements. Lastly, the feasible, low-cost, and visually educational
   instrument made by the participants showcases the value of such a
   multi-disciplinary approach.},

Title = {Day-Ahead Optimal Dispatch Strategy for Active Distribution Network
   Based on Improved Deep Reinforcement Learning},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {9357-9370},
Abstract = {To effectively deal with the challenge of optimal dispatch caused by
   uncertainties such as renewable energy in active distribution network, a
   day-ahead optimal dispatch strategy for active distribution network
   based on improved deep reinforcement learning is proposed. First, the
   day-ahead optimal dispatch problem for the active distribution network
   is modeled as a multistage stochastic programming model. Multistage
   models attempt to capture the dynamics of unfolding uncertainties over
   time, so that the interaction between decision making and uncertainty
   unfolding is represented more accurately and realistically, and the
   decision can be adjusted dynamically and adaptively. Second, with the
   help of deep neural network to approximate the power flow model of the
   active distribution network in a data-driven manner, an improved deep
   reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to solve the corresponding
   multistage stochastic programming problem. The proposed improved deep
   reinforcement learning algorithm effectively solves the problem that
   trial-and-error information acquisition methods are difficult to apply
   to high-cost power systems. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed
   day-ahead optimization dispatch strategy for active distribution network
   based on improved deep reinforcement learning is verified by a modified
   IEEE33 case.},

Abstract = {National calls to improve student academic success in college have
   sparked the development of bridge programs designed to help students
   transition from high school to college. We designed a 2-week Summer
   Bridge program that taught introductory biology content in an
   active-learning way. Through a set of exploratory interviews, we
   unexpectedly identified that Bridge students had developed sophisticated
   views of active learning, even though this was not an explicit goal of
   the program. We conducted an additional set of semistructured interviews
   that focused on active learning and compared the interviews of Bridge
   students with those from non-Bridge students who had been eligible for
   but did not participate in the program. We used the constant comparative
   method to identify themes from the interviews. We found that Bridge
   students perceived that, because they knew how to approach active
   learning and viewed it as important, they benefited more from active
   learning in introductory biology than non-Bridge students. Specifically,
   Bridge students seemed to be more aware of their own learning gains from
   participating in active learning. Compared with the majority of
   non-Bridge students, the majority of Bridge students described using a
   greater variety of strategies to maximize their experiences in active
   learning. Finally, in contrast to non-Bridge students, Bridge students
   indicated that they take an equitable approach to group work. These
   findings suggest that we may be able to prime students to maximize their
   own and other's experiences in active learning.},

Title = {Fingerprints of Teaching Interactions: Capturing and Quantifying How
   Supervisor Regulate Autonomy of Residents in the Operating Room},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Supervisors and residents agree that entrusted autonomy is
   central to learning in the Operating Room (OR), but supervisors and
   residents hold different opinions about entrustment: residents regularly
   experience that they receive insufficient autonomy while supervisors
   feel their guiding is not appreciated as teaching. These opinions are
   commonly grounded on general experiences and perceptions, instead of
   real-time supervisors' regulatory behaviors as procedures unfold. To
   close that gap, we captured and analyzed when and to what level
   supervisors award or restrain autonomy during procedures. Furthermore,
   we constructed fingerprints, an instrument to visualize entrustment of
   autonomy by supervisors in the OR that allows us to reflect on
   regulation of autonomy and discuss teaching interactions.
   DESIGN: All interactions between supervisors and residents were captured
   by video and transcribed. Subsequently a multistage analysis was
   performed: (1) the procedure was broken down into 10 steps, (2) for each
   step, type and frequency of strategies by supervisors to regulate
   autonomy were scored, (3) the scores for each step were plotted into
   fingerprints, and (4) fingerprints were analyzed and compared.
   SETTING: University Medical Centre Groningen (the Netherlands).
   PARTICIPANTS: Six different supervisor-resident dyads.
   RESULTS: No fingerprint was alike . timing, frequency, and type of
   strategy that supervisors used to regulate autonomy varied within and
   between procedures. Comparing fingerprints revealed that supervisors B
   and D displayed more overall control over their program-year 5 residents
   than supervisors C and E over their program-year 4 residents.
   Furthermore, each supervisor restrained autonomy during steps 4 to 6 but
   with different intensities.
   CONCLUSIONS: Fingerprints show a high definition view on the unique
   dynamics of real-time autonomy regulation in the OR. One fingerprint
   functions as a snapshot and serves a purpose in one-off teaching and
   learning. Multiple snapshots of one resident quantify autonomy
   development over time, while multiple snapshots of supervisors may
   capture best teaching practices to feed train-the-trainer programs. (C)

Title = {Hybridizing Cartesian Genetic Programming and Harmony Search for
   adaptive feature construction in supervised learning problems},

Abstract = {The advent of the so-called Big Data paradigm has motivated a flurry of
   research aimed at enhancing machine learning models by following very
   diverse approaches. In this context this work focuses on the automatic
   construction of features in supervised learning problems, which differs
   from the conventional selection of features in that new characteristics
   with enhanced predictive power are inferred from the original dataset.
   In particular this manuscript proposes a new iterative feature
   construction approach based on a self-learning meta-heuristic algorithm
   (Harmony Search) and a solution encoding strategy (correspondingly,
   Cartesian Genetic Programming) suited to represent combinations of
   features by means of constant-length solution vectors. The proposed
   feature construction algorithm, coined as Adaptive Cartesian Harmony
   Search (ACHS), incorporates modifications that allow exploiting the
   estimated predictive importance of intermediate solutions and,
   ultimately, attaining better convergence rate in its iterative learning
   procedure. The performance of the proposed ACHS scheme is assessed and
   compared to that rendered by the state of the art in a toy example and
   three practical use cases from the literature. The excellent performance
   figures obtained in these problems shed light on the widespread
   applicability of the proposed scheme to supervised learning with legacy
   datasets composed by already refined characteristics. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {Background The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health issue and
   has had a major impact on education. Consequently, half way through the
   second semester of the academic year 2019/2020, learning methods were
   delivered through distance learning (DL). We aimed to evaluate the
   student perspective of DL compared to classroom learning (CL) in the
   undergraduate dentistry study program at the Faculty of Dentistry
   Universitas Indonesia. Methods An online questionnaire was sent at the
   end of the semester. A total of 301 students participated in the study.
   Results Duration of study influenced student preference. Higher number
   of first-year students preferred DL compared to their seniors (p <
   0.001). Students preferred CL for group discussion, as DL resulted in
   more difficult communication and gave less learning satisfaction. Only
   44.2\% students preferred DL over CL, although they agreed that DL gave
   a more efficient learning method (52.6\%), it provided more time to
   study (87.9\%) and to review study materials (87.3\%). Challenges during
   DL included external factors such as unstable internet connection, extra
   financial burden for the internet quota and internal factors such as
   time management and difficulty to focus while learning online for a
   longer period of time. Conclusion Despite some challenges, dental
   students could adapt to the new learning methods of full DL and the
   majorities agreed blended learning that combined classroom and distance
   learning can be implemented henceforth. This current COVID-19 pandemic,
   changes not only the utilization of technology in education but the
   pedagogy strategies in the future.},

Title = {The Learning Environment Counts: Longitudinal Qualitative Analysis of
   Study Strategies Adopted by First-Year Medical Students in a
   Competency-Based Educational Program},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {91},
Number = {11, S},
Pages = {S44-S52},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose
   The move toward competency-based education will require medical schools
   and postgraduate training programs to restructure learning environments
   to motivate trainees to take personal ownership for learning. This
   qualitative study explores how medical students select and implement
   study strategies while enrolled in a unique, nontraditional program that
   emphasizes reflection on performance and competence rather than relying
   on high-stakes examinations or grades to motivate students to learn and
   excel.
   Method
   Fourteen first-year medical students volunteered to participate in
   three, 45-minute interviews (42 overall) scheduled three months apart
   during 2013-2014. Two medical educators used structured interview guides
   to solicit students' previous assessment experiences, preferred learning
   strategies, and performance monitoring processes. Interviews were
   digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Participants confirmed
   accuracy of transcripts. Researchers independently read transcripts and
   met regularly to discuss transcripts and judge when themes achieved
   saturation.
   Results
   Medical students can adopt an assessment for learning mind-set with
   faculty guidance and implement appropriate study strategies for
   mastery-learning demands. Though students developed new strategies at
   different rates during the year, they all eventually identified study
   and performance monitoring strategies to meet learning needs. Students
   who had diverse learning experiences in college embraced mastery-based
   study strategies sooner than peers after recognizing that the learning
   environment did not reward performance-based strategies.
   Conclusions
   Medical students can take ownership for their learning and implement
   specific strategies to regulate behavior when learning environments
   contain building blocks emphasized in self-determination theory.
   Findings should generalize to educational programs seeking strategies to
   design learning environments that promote self-regulated learning.},

Title = {The role of feedback and guidance as intervention methods to foster
   computational thinking in educational robotics learning activities for
   primary school},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is considered an emerging competence domain
   linked to 21st -century competences, and educational robotics (ER) is
   increasingly recognised as a tool to develop CT competences. This is why
   researchers recommend developing intervention methods adapted to
   classroom practice and providing explicit guidelines to teachers on
   integrating ER activities.The present study thus addresses this
   challenge. Guidance and feedback were considered as critical
   intervention methods to foster CT competences in ER settings. A
   between-subjects experiment was conducted with 66 students aged 8 to 9
   in the context of a remote collaborative robot programming mission, with
   four experimental conditions. A two-step strategy was employed to report
   students' CT competence (their performance and learning process).
   Firstly, the students' CT learning gains were measured through a
   pre-post-test design. Secondly, video analysis was used to identify the
   creative computational problem-solving patterns involved in the
   experimental condition that had the most favourable impact on the
   students' CT scores.Results show that delayed feedback is an effective
   intervention method for CT development in ER activities. Subject to
   delayed feedback, students are better at formulating the robot behaviour
   to be programmed, and, thus, such a strategy reinforces the anticipation
   process underlying the CT.},

Abstract = {An educational software tool was developed for teaching the real-time
   state simulation of water distribution networks (WDNs) to municipal
   engineering students. The weighted-least-square model and
   Davidon-Fletcher-Powell (DFP) algorithm were used to calculate the state
   variable values with real-time measurements. The software tool was
   composed of three modules, including network loading, state simulation,
   and data management. The program and the relevant graphical user
   interface were coded using Delphi 7.0. The performance of the software
   tool was proved to be effective in teaching and learning by two
   evaluation approaches. Moreover, the positive results also encouraged
   software developers and lecturers to produce or at least use
   computer-aided tools for educational purposes.},

Abstract = {Universities collect information from each customer that contacts them
   through their websites and social media profiles. Customer knowledge
   surveys are the main information-gathering tool used to obtain this
   information about potential students. In this paper, we propose using
   the information gained via surveys along with enrolment databases, to
   group customers into homogeneous clusters in order to identify target
   customers who are more likely to enroll. The use of such a cluster
   strategy will increase the probability of converting contacts into
   customers and will allow the marketing and admission departments to
   focus on those customers with a greater probability of enrolling,
   thereby increasing efficiency. The specific characteristics of each
   cluster and those postgraduate programs that are more likely to be
   selected are identified. In addition, better insight into customers
   regarding their enrolment choices thanks to our cluster strategy, will
   allow universities to personalize their services resulting in greater
   satisfaction and, consequently, in increased future enrolment.},

Title = {Uncovering Cultural Barriers to Quality Improvement Learning in a Trauma
   Program: An Ethnographic Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {76},

Pages = {497-505},
Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Quality improvement (QI) training is an essential component
   of postgraduate surgical education and can occur through formal and
   informal education programs. Informal QI education requires that faculty
   take advantage of learning opportunities in the hospital setting. Trauma
   rotations appear ideal opportunities for informal QI learning given that
   performance improvement is a mandatory component of care at verified
   trauma centers. It is unclear, however, whether QI initiatives within
   trauma programs are well integrated into trainee education. This study
   explored the QI learning environment in a level 1 academic trauma
   center.
   STUDY DESIGN: An ethnographic study using observation and interviews
   methods. The theoretical lens of hidden curriculum was used to interpret
   the data and generate hypotheses around faculty and trainee experiences.
   SETTING: University of Toronto and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center.
   PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven observations involving more than 50 faculty
   and trainees; seventeen interviews with faculty and surgical trainees.
   RESULTS: All faculty and trainees endorsed QI and informal QI learning.
   Discrepant experiences were found regarding opportunities to learn and
   do QI in the clinical setting. Faculty viewed themselves as perpetually
   doing and teaching QI while trainees perceived little to no QI learning.
   Trainees identified Morbidity and Mortality rounds as the main
   opportunity for QI learning; however, traditional teaching style through
   ``pimping{''} and a largely clinical focus acted as barriers to QI
   education. Furthermore, trainees chiefly viewed QI as service to the
   institution, rather than as a form of learning, which contributed to
   their disinterest in taking up informal QI lessons.
   CONCLUSION: Informal QI education is highly valued and desired in
   academic trauma centers but enduring teaching methods, inconsistencies
   in the cultural learning environment and a hidden curriculum devaluing
   QI learning are persistent barriers to change. (C) 2018 Association of

Title = {The challenge of planning learning opportunities for clinical medicine:
   a triangulation study in Iran},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {JUL 31},
Abstract = {BackgroundAn essential characteristics of clinical education is the need
   to learn a large number of practical and communication skills along with
   theoretical knowledge. It is challenging to design learning
   opportunities (LOs) for clinical setting. We aimed to determine optimal
   learning opportunities from the viewpoint of Medical curriculum
   planners, to determine the gap between the current condition and the
   optimal condition in medical schools, and to present feasible tactic for
   clinical learning opportunities.MethodsThis study comprised of three
   sub-studies and was conducted using triangulation. The first sub-study
   was performed using the Modified Delphi method with a view to
   identifying optimal learning opportunities. Data was collected by online
   focus group discussion and a questionnaire. The second sub-study was
   conducted with the aim of comparing the current condition and the
   optimal condition. Data was collected from nine medical schools across
   Iran using a checklist, available documents, observation, and interview.
   The third sub-study was conducted using an expert panel comprising of
   seven curriculum planners of the M.D. program. The goal of this phase
   was to provide feasible tactic to improve clinical education in medical
   schools.ResultsIn the first sub-study, the participants determined all
   items, including student-centered learning, non-threatening learning
   environment, and record and management system of clinical learning
   opportunities as implementable learning opportunities with over 70\%
   consensus. However, in the second sub-study, student-centered teaching
   methods were practiced in 33\% of medical schools and the
   non-threatening learning environment in 67\% of the schools, while the
   record and management system of learning opportunities was not launched
   in any of the schools. From the viewpoint of the expert panel members,
   learning opportunities adapted to clinical contents, specification of
   content-based learning opportunities, and continuous supervision on
   learners to achieve the expected learning outcomes were among clinical
   learning opportunities with over 70\%
   consensus.ConclusionsStudent-centered clinical learning practices,
   together with virtual learning methods, can lead to clinical
   enhancement. Opportunities such as interactive and participatory
   practices should gain further consideration. Also assigning
   responsibility to learners and monitoring them are strategies for
   enhancement.},

Abstract = {Histology is a traditional core basic science component of most medical
   and dental education programs and presents a didactic challenge for many
   students. Identifying students that are likely to struggle with
   histology would allow for early intervention to support and encourage
   their learning success. To identify student characteristics that are
   associated with learning success in histology, three first-year medical
   school classes at the University of Michigan (>440 students) were
   surveyed about their educational background, attitudes toward learning
   histology, and their use of histology learning strategies and resources.
   These characteristics were linked with the students' quiz and
   examination results in histology. Students who reported previous
   experience in histology or pathology and hold science or biomedical
   science college degrees usually did well in histology. Learning success
   in histology was also positively associated with students' perception
   that histology is important for their professional career. Other
   positive indicators were in-person participation in teacher-guided
   learning experiences, specifically lecture and laboratory sessions. In
   contrast, students who relied on watching histology lectures by video
   rather than going to lectures in-person performed significantly worse.
   These characteristics and learning strategies of students who did well
   in this very visual and challenging study subject should be of help for
   identifying and advising students early, who might be at risk of failing
   a histology course or component. Anat Sci Educ 8: 1-11. (c) 2014

Abstract = {The availability of reliable evidence for teaching practices after
   professional development is limited across science, technology,
   engineering, and mathematics disciplines, making the identification of
   professional development ``best practices{''} and effective models for
   change difficult. We aimed to determine the extent to which postdoctoral
   fellows (i.e., future biology faculty) believed in and implemented
   evidence-based pedagogies after completion of a 2-yr professional
   development program, Faculty Institutes for Reforming Science Teaching
   (FIRST IV). Postdocs (PDs) attended a 2-yr training program during which
   they completed self-report assessments of their beliefs about teaching
   and gains in pedagogical knowledge and experience, and they provided
   copies of class assessments and video recordings of their teaching. The
   PDs reported greater use of learner-centered compared with
   teacher-centered strategies. These data were consistent with the results
   of expert reviews of teaching videos. The majority of PDs (86\%)
   received video ratings that documented active engagement of students and
   implementation of learner-centered classrooms. Despite practice of
   higher-level cognition in class sessions, the items used by the PDs on
   their assessments of learning focused on lower-level cognitive skills.
   We attributed the high success of the FIRST IV program to our focus on
   inexperienced teachers, an iterative process of teaching practice and
   reflection, and development of and teaching a full course.},

Title = {A qualitative study of nurses' perceptions of a behavioural strategies
   e-learning program to reduce interruptions during medication
   administration},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},

Abstract = {Objectives: We sought to evaluate the perceptions of nurses of an
   e-learning educational program to encourage the use of behavioural
   strategies blocking, engaging, mediating, multitasking, and preventing
   to reduce the negative effects of interruptions during medication
   administration.
   Design: A qualitative design was used to evaluate the impact of this
   e-learning educational intervention on nurses' behaviour.
   Settings: Two wards (palliative care and aged care) from two different
   hospitals within a large local health service within Sydney Australia,
   were included in the study. These wards were also involved in a cluster
   randomised trial to test the effectiveness of the program.
   Participants: A purposive sample participated comprising nine registered
   and enrolled nurses certified to conduct medication administration, who
   had reviewed the educational modules.
   Methods: Two focus groups were conducted and these sessions were
   digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis
   identified seven themes.
   Results: The major themes identified included: perceptions of
   interruptions, accessing the program, content of the program, impact,
   maintaining good practice and facilitators and barriers to changing
   behaviour.
   Conclusions: The use of embedded authentic images of patient
   interruptions and management strategies increased some nurses' perceived
   use of strategies to manage interruptions. Nurses varied in their
   perception as to whether they could change their behaviour with some
   describing change at the individual and ward team levels, while others
   described patient caseload and other health professionals as a barrier.
   The use of this innovative educational intervention is recommended for
   staff orientation, student nurses, medical officers and allied health
   staff. Further research is required in how this e-learning program can
   be used in combination with other effective interventions to reduce
   interruptions.},

Title = {Facilitating learning of community-based rehabilitation through
   problem-based learning in higher education},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},

Abstract = {Background The quality of community-based rehabilitation (CBR) personnel
   is one of the key factors that contributes to the success of CBR
   programs. Integrating knowledge and practical skills in various stages
   of the learning process is essential in community-based rehabilitation.
   Problem-based learning (PBL) is a pedagogical strategy that uses
   real-world situations as the basis for developing knowledge and
   problem-solving skills. Through PBL, learners are guided and facilitated
   in assuming active problem-solving roles in real-world situations. This
   study developed and tested a framework and a PBL protocol for use in
   teaching community-based rehabilitation (CBR) in higher education.
   Methods Part I of this study focused on the development of a framework
   and a protocol for PBL. An initial framework for the development of this
   protocol was formed based on a review of relevant literature. Concrete
   guidelines were delineated to describe the application, process, and
   delivery of teaching and learning. PBL was implemented in three CBR
   related courses. Students were facilitated to learn CBR in passing
   various stages of PBL through a self-directed learning process. The
   cumulative efforts of each group were compiled, recorded, and displayed
   using e-portfolios. In Part II, the processes and outcomes of using this
   new learning mode were evaluated using a case study approach to examine
   the protocol's efficacy. Focus group interviews, a questionnaire, and a
   detailed examination of the e-portfolios were administered for
   evaluation. Results One hundred thirty-three students from three CBR
   related courses were recruited. PBL was regarded as an effective,
   realistic and practical method that enables critical thinking in CBR.
   Practicality was addressed by covering context-related materials with
   the use of real cases or examples. Participants were actively engaged in
   the learning process and their CBR competence was enhanced. Conclusions
   Through the new protocol, the students were equipped with active
   learning, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills that should
   facilitate success in CBR.},

Abstract = {Problem: Systems-based practice focuses on the organization, financing,
   and delivery of medical services. The American Association of Medical
   Colleges has recommended that systems-based practice be incorporated
   into medical schools' curricula. However, experiential learning in
   systems-based practice, including practical strategies to improve the
   quality and efficiency of clinical care, is often absent from or
   inconsistently included in medical education. Intervention: A
   multidisciplinary clinician and nonclinician faculty team partnered with
   a cardiology outpatient clinic to design a 9-month clerkship for
   1st-year medical students focused on systems-based practice, delivery of
   clinical care, and strategies to improve the quality and efficiency of
   clinical operations. The clerkship was called the Action Research
   Program. In 2013-2014, 8 trainees participated in educational seminars,
   research activities, and 9-week clinic rotations. A qualitative process
   and outcome evaluation drew on interviews with students, clinic staff,
   and supervising physicians, as well as students' detailed field notes.
   Context: The Action Research Program was developed and implemented at
   the University of California, San Francisco, an academic medical center
   in the United States. All educational activities took place at the
   university's medical school and at the medical center's cardiology
   outpatient clinic. Outcome: Students reported and demonstrated increased
   understanding of how care delivery systems work, improved clinical
   skills, growing confidence in interactions with patients, and
   appreciation for patients' experiences. Clinicians reported increased
   efficiency at the clinic level and improved performance and job
   satisfaction among medical assistants as a result of their unprecedented
   mentoring role with students. Some clinicians felt burdened when
   students shadowed them and asked questions during interactions with
   patients. Most student-led improvement projects were not fully
   implemented. Lessons Learned: The Action Research Program is a small
   pilot project that demonstrates an innovative pairing of experiential
   and didactic training in systems-based practice. Lessons learned include
   the need for dedicated time and faculty support for students'
   improvement projects, which were the least successful aspect of the
   program. We recommend that future projects aiming to combine clinical
   training and quality improvement projects designate distinct blocks of
   time for trainees to pursue each of these activities independently. In
   2014-2015, the University of California, San Francisco School of
   Medicine incorporated key features of the Action Research Program into
   the standard curriculum, with plans to build upon this foundation in
   future curricular innovations.},

Title = {Doing what works: A grounded theory case study of technology use by
   teachers of English at a Korean university},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {80},
Pages = {84-94},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Despite considerable effort and expenditure by the Korean government and
   universities to promote technology use in tertiary education, few
   teachers of English in Korea regularly and consistently employ
   technology in their teaching. Moreover, research into the hindrances and
   enablers of technology use in English education in Korea has been
   limited for primary and secondary schools and conspicuously absent on
   the tertiary level. This case study examines what teachers in a general
   English department at a private university in Seoul undergo as they
   consider the use of technology both in and out of classrooms. It
   attempts to provide a holistic look into teacher decision-making in this
   context. It employs a grounded theory of investigation underpinned by a
   close reading of the diffusion of innovations theory by Rogers (2003).
   Data for the study involves three main techniques: semi-structured
   interviews, a survey questionnaire, and classroom observations. Analysis
   follows an iterative, grounded method and includes use of both
   qualitative and quantitative software programs (Atlas.ti 5.0 and SPSS
   16.0 respectively). Results from the study form a substantive theory
   entitled ``what works{''} which helps explain the myriad of decisions
   that teachers make while trying to manage personal (internal) and
   administrative (external) goals and aims. Further, all decisions within
   this system are underpinned by ``what works{''} for teachers in any
   situation both in terms of reliability and consistency. Implications
   suggest that the use of technology in the classroom exacerbates
   preexisting pedagogical and infrastructure issues, leading to
   inconsistencies in representation and application, as well as an overall
   limitation of potential use by teachers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {The influence of occupational therapy students' preferred language on
   academic and clinical performance in a Canadian university program},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 24},
Abstract = {The Occupational Therapy Program at this Canadian university is a French
   program however, students must be bilingual to function in English or
   French clinical fieldwork settings. An understanding of the role of
   language in successful completion of program requirements was needed to
   effectively support students' education. The study objectives were to
   identify the role of linguistic factors in students' academic and
   clinical performance and to provide recommendations for strategies to
   address areas of learning difficulty. A multimethod approach used 4 data
   sources: (1) Multiple Mini Interview (MMI) informal language assessment
   scores, (2) grade point average (GPA), (3) fieldwork evaluation reports,
   and (4) an online survey of program graduates. The GPA on admission and
   MMI scores of 140 students predicted respectively only 20\% and 2\% of
   the variation in GPA on program completion. The areas of poorest
   performance in failed clinical fieldwork reports were in clinical
   reasoning and communication competencies. Among survey respondents (n =
   47), 44.5\% reported that a clinical placement in their second language
   with related charting (51.6\%) and client communication (40.9\%) were
   the most significant difficulties encountered in the program. Clients
   with mental health issues (45.4\%) were the most challenging population
   to work with, attributed to communication barriers in the students'
   second language. Strategies are proposed to support occupational therapy
   students' academic and clinical language proficiency, including
   conversational training courses, problem-based learning activities in
   students' second language, focussed teaching on the clinical reasoning
   process and reflective skills, and language coaching to address early
   signs of difficulty in clinical fieldwork.},

Abstract = {Data indicate that females and ethnic/race minority groups are
   underrepresented in the science and engineering workforce calling for
   innovative strategies to engage and retain them in science education and
   careers. This study reports on the development, delivery, and outcomes
   of a culturally driven science, technology, engineering, mathematics
   (STEM) program, iSTEM, aimed at increasing engagement in STEM learning
   among Native American 3rd-8th grade students. A culturally relevant
   theoretical framework, Funds of Knowledge, informs the iSTEM program, a
   program based on the contention that the synergistic effect of a hybrid
   program combining two strategic approaches (1) in-school mentoring and
   (2) out-of-school informal science education experiences would foster
   engagement and interest in STEM learning. Students are paired with one
   of three types of mentors: Native American community members, university
   students, and STEM professionals. The iSTEM program is theme based with
   all program activities specifically relevant to Native people living in
   southern Arizona. Student mentees and mentors complete interactive flash
   STEM activities at lunch hour and attend approximately six field trips
   per year. Data from the iSTEM program indicate that the program has been
   successful in engaging Native American students in iSTEM as well as
   increasing their interest in STEM and their science beliefs.},

Title = {The effects of Team-Based Learning on learning behaviors in the
   maternal-child nursing course},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-30},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: The Team-Based Learning (TBL) method has been used as a
   teaching strategy in many disciplines. It is instructor-led,
   learner-centered learning with functions similar to those of
   problem-based learning, but it is more cost-effective. However, little
   is known about the application of TBL to nursing education.
   Objectives: The objectives of the study are to employ the TBL approach
   in a Maternal-Child Nursing course and to evaluate its effects on
   learning outcomes.
   Design: We present one-group pretest-posttest research design with the
   intervention of the TBL teaching strategy. Settings: The study was
   conducted in one of the nursing universities in Taiwan.
   Participants: One-hundred-four students in 2011 and 103 students in 2012
   in an RN-to-BSN program who enrolled in the Maternal-Child Nursing
   course participated in this study. These students had graduated from a
   five-year nursing diploma program before enrolling in the RN-BSN
   program.
   Methods: Data were collected before and after the implementation of the
   TB!, which included active learning, in-class activities, and
   application exercises. The Class Engagement Survey (CES), Value of Teams
   (VTs), Self-Directed Learning Instrument (SDLI), and exam scores were
   used to measure students' learning outcomes.
   Results: TBL significantly influenced the students' learning outcomes.
   Students who expressed that TBL increased their learning interests had a
   higher score on VT; and students who had high achievement from the
   current TBL course had higher scores on the CES, VT, and SDLI. The means
   of the group test scores and the final examination score were
   significantly higher than the individual scores from the in-class tests
   in both 2011, 2012, and the combination of 2011 and 2012.
   Conclusion: The TBL design requires out-of-class preparation before all
   classes, which requires active and self-directed learning. TBL provides
   opportunities to foster learner-to-learner interactions, which lead to
   more active engagement and teamwork among learners. It also promotes the
   students' class engagement and teamwork values, and it increases
   academic performance. The TBL is suggested to have a greater effect on
   academically weaker students. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Purpose: The Teaching Personal and Social Responsibility (TPSR) model
   was developed to foster responsibility and teach life skills that
   transfer to various settings. The purpose of this study was to assess
   the implementation fidelity of a school-based TPSR program in physical
   education and other subject areas. Method: Systematic observation was
   used to assess implementation in two elementary schools. Participants
   were seven teachers and 170 students between 8 and 12 years old (87
   girls and 83 boys). Results: Teachers' adherence to the model was deemed
   moderate, with varied application of established responsibility-based
   teaching strategies. Teachers had notably lower scores related to
   promoting life skill transfer. However, the strategies teachers used to
   foster responsibility were significantly correlated with their students'
   demonstration of responsible behaviors. Discussion/Conclusion: Results
   indicate TPSR may provide an effective framework for promoting
   responsibility across the school curriculum. Implications for research
   and strategies for promoting implementation fidelity are discussed.},

Abstract = {Bioscience is a foundational unit (subject) of undergraduate allied
   health degree programs, providing students the scientific basis
   underpinning their clinical practice. However, despite its significance.
   bioscience is a difficult academic hurdle for many students to master.
   The introduction of active learning strategies, including small
   team-based guided-inquiry learning approaches, has been shown to
   significantly reduce this hurdle and improve assessment outcomes for the
   learner. Guided team-based activities can aid in this approach by also
   building broader skills and capabilities, like teamwork and
   communication, as well as subject-specific knowledge and skills, thereby
   positively influencing student assessment outcomes. This paper details
   the redesign and evaluation of two first-year Bioscience for Paramedics
   units with the introduction of guided-inquiry learning, as well as other
   active learning strategies. and assesses their impact on student
   performance. Results indicate that active learning used within a
   classroom and in the large lecture theater setting improved students'
   grades with positive student perception of their learning experience.},

Abstract = {Technology has flourished, and diverse teaching techniques have emerged
   such as eBooks, massive open online courses, and gamification.
   Accordingly, technologies continue to provide a revolutionary
   improvement on traditional learning environments. The pedagogic trend is
   becoming ``student-centered''. Problem-based learning (PBL) is the use
   of problems to motivate learners to apply research concepts and thinking
   strategies. Gamification provides the learners to actively learn through
   gamified mechanisms. This study focuses on PBL and gamification to
   enhance students' engagement in learning computer science. We developed
   a computer science learning system (CSLS) comprising three subjects:
   database management, programming, and data structure. Each subject has
   problem-solving mini games for students to accomplish tasks using
   relevant concepts. Results reveal that learners have a 95\% probability
   of obtaining above-average user satisfaction, which suggests that the
   CSLS can be a good vehicle for cultivating the relevant computer science
   concepts. Participants' technology acceptance and their cognitive load
   when using the system are also determined in the experiment, with the
   aim of examining learners' perception while using the CSLS. Further,
   gamification has indicated a positive effect on students' learning
   performance and cognition for learning computer science.},

Abstract = {IntroductionPerception of one's learning environment is associated with
   academic performance and well-being of medical students. Yet, few
   studies have explored learners' perceptions and their correlates within
   apostgraduate environment. This study examined longitudinal changes in
   learning environment perception, perceived stress and coping for
   psychiatry residents in junior and senior years of training. Based on
   extant social learning theories, we hypothesized that learning
   environment perceptions will improve with seniority, and be accompanied
   by lower stress levels and better coping.MethodsEighty-two out of 101
   psychiatry residents (81.2\%) from our National Psychiatry Residency
   Program rated their perception of learning environment, perceived
   stress, and coping strategies from June 2016 to June 2018. Correlations
   between these variables, and changes across five timepoints were
   examined.ResultsSenior-year residents reported better perception of
   learning environment over time, together with increased use of
   problem-focused coping and lowered perceived stress levels. Junior-year
   residents reported no changes in learning environment perception and
   coping strategies, despite rating greater perceived stress levels over
   time. Perception of learning environment negatively correlated with
   perceived stress levels and specific coping strategies.DiscussionBased
   on these findings, we suggest specific strategies with the emphasis on
   context, participation, and social interaction within acommunity of
   practice to better support residents in training, which are applicable
   to other similar training programs.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the relationships among teachers' motivational
   beliefs, motivational regulation, and their learning engagement in
   online professional learning communities. More importantly, teachers'
   online learning behaviors were collected and used as indicates of
   learning engagement. 520 teachers involved in a training program were
   surveyed. The results of regression analyses showed that teachers'
   perceived task value positively predicted their online learning
   engagement. Moreover, teachers' motivational regulation played a partial
   mediating role in the predicting power of perceived task value to
   learning engagement. In addition, the first half of the mediating path
   among perceived task value, motivational regulation, and learning
   engagement was moderated by teachers' self-efficacy. The moderating
   effect on motivational regulation was higher for teachers with a high
   sense of self-efficacy than those with a low sense of self-efficacy.
   Therefore, it was suggested to assign learning tasks that meet the needs
   of teachers and pay attention to the cultivation of teachers'
   self-efficacy beliefs to increase their learning engagement in online
   professional learning communities. The limitations and the future
   research directions were discussed.},

Abstract = {Contribution: Active classroom programmer (ACP) is a software tool that
   places minimal pressure on resources, and is shown to help improve
   student learning while also encouraging a high degree of engagement both
   during and outside of programming lectures.
   Background: Programming is difficult for students, largely due to the
   myriad of ever-advancing concepts. As students gradually become stronger
   programmers, both within a course and within their degree, they are
   constantly presented with new and challenging programming concepts
   regardless of their expertise. While laboratory sessions provide an
   excellent opportunity for students to independently practice, this does
   not help them in the programming process where expert scaffolding is
   desired.
   Intended outcomes: ACP is intended to engage students with active
   programming exercises and develop an inductive approach to learning,
   focusing on developing problem-solving skills.
   Application design: Students need guidance in the programming strategy
   rather than the syntax and peculiarities of the particular programming
   language. ACP allows students to program alongside instructors as new
   concepts are introduced.
   Findings: Experience from two concept-rich programming courses at
   different levels is presented, demonstrating students engaged with ACP
   both inside and outside lectures to deepen their understanding of the
   programming concepts.},

   Scheduling Problem of Hybrid Flow Shop With Unrelated Parallel Machine},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Abstract = {Efficient scheduling benefits productivity promotion, energy savings and
   the customer's satisfaction. In recent years, with a growing concern
   about the energy saving and environmental impact, energy oriented
   scheduling is going to be a hot issue for sustainable manufacturing. In
   this study, we investigate an energy-oriented scheduling problem
   deriving from the hybrid flow shop with unrelated parallel machine.
   First, we formulate the scheduling problem with a mixed integer linear
   programming (MILP) model, which considers two objectives including
   minimizing the completion time and energy consumption. Second, a hybrid
   multi-objective teaching-learning based optimization (HMOTLBO) algorithm
   based on decomposition is proposed. In the proposed HMOTLBO, a new
   solution presentation and five decoding rules are designed for mining
   the optimal solution. To reduce the standby energy consumption and
   turning on/off energy consumption, a greedy shifting algorithm is
   developed without changing the completion time of a scheduling. To
   improve the converge speed of the algorithm, a weight matching strategy
   is designed to avoid randomly matching weight vectors with students. To
   enhance the exploration and exploitation capacities of the algorithm, A
   teaching operator based on crossover and a self-learning operator based
   on a variable neighborhood search(VNS) are proposed. Finally, fourth
   different experiments are performed on 15 cases, the comparison result
   verified the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed
   algorithm.},

Title = {Does a novel teaching approach work? A Students' perspective},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {85},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background: There is always a call for educational reform and further
   research to improve educational programs. The continuous development of
   new educational approaches is a work in progress. Educational strategies
   like team-based learning, flipped classroom, and lottery-based token
   economy, were used to develop a novel teaching approach.
   Aim: This study had two major goals. The first goal was to introduce a
   novel teaching approach in professional healthcare academies. The second
   goal was to get an in-depth understanding, from the students'
   perspective, about the benefits and limitations of this new teaching
   approach.
   Method: The study was conducted using a qualitative, phenomenological
   research design. Third and fourth-year nursing students completed
   reflective journals to describe their personal experience with the new
   teaching approach at the end of the semester. The students' responses
   were analyzed and coded using Kember's four-category coding schema for
   reflective writing, to extract themes using thematic analysis.
   Findings: Seventy-five students completed and returned their reflective
   journals. The analysis showed various challenges and
   facilitators/benefits of the students' experiences. The themes that
   emerged from the analysis were: lack of exposure vs. a sense of
   achievement; lack of teamwork skills vs. role fulfillment; working with
   new people vs. conflict resolution; variation vs.
   collaboration/creativity; time management vs. constructive competition;
   wasting resources vs. flexibility, and proactivity/active engagement.
   These themes summarized why the new teaching approach worked and what
   barriers students faced with the new assembly.
   Conclusion: Results from the current study demonstrated the great
   potential of the new teaching approach. Recommendations for future
   research were also discussed.},

Abstract = {A four-stage online collaborative learning approach to supporting
   teachers' professional development was proposed and described in this
   paper. This study investigated primary school teachers' interactive
   networks and social knowledge construction behavioral patterns in online
   collaborative learning activities. The subject of this study was 83
   primary school Chinese teachers who were participating in a structured
   online professional development program that was 6 months in duration.
   By combining social network analysis, content analysis and lag
   sequential analysis, results showed that interactive networks generated
   in two rounds of online collaborative learning activities were low
   reciprocal, and loosely connected with a low cohesiveness. There was no
   significant difference of behavior distributions between core and
   peripheral members. Moreover, teachers' social knowledge construction
   behavioral patterns presented different characteristics in different
   rounds of activities. In addition, this study identified certain
   problems in teachers' online learning. Finally, some implications for
   the design of teacher education programs, limitations and further
   research plans are proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Computational thinking, as an essential competency for the future
   development of citizens, is an important goal of computer science
   instruction. Although studies have shown that early exposure to computer
   programming is beneficial for improving computational thinking, current
   programming instruction does not systematically consider the factors
   that influence the development of computational thinking. To promote the
   early development of computational thinking, we analyzed the main
   factors that influence the development of computational thinking in
   terms of learners' cognitive level, instructional content, and
   technological environment. Therefore, this study proposes a teaching
   framework for developing computational thinking based on embodied
   cognitive theory. This teaching framework shows how to choose a suitable
   technological environment, design the appropriate content and apply
   adequate methods to effectively promote students' computational thinking
   development.},

Abstract = {Background: Equipping student midwives with confidence to deliver
   bereavement care to childbearing women is a challenge for midwifery
   lecturers.
   Objective: To explore qualitative data provided by student midwives who
   evaluated the workbook Bereavement care for childbearing women and their
   families (Hollins Martin \& Forrest, 2013) to explore their views of
   potential teaching strategies that could build their confidence to
   deliver real bereavement care.
   Method: An exploratory qualitative thematic analysis was used to
   provide, analyse and report themes identified within data collected in a
   prior study.
   Participants: Participants were student midwives (n = 179) in their
   second/third year of a midwifery degree program at 1 of 3 universities
   in the UK were included in the study.
   Data collection/analysis: Data to evaluate effectiveness of the
   bereavement workbook as a teaching method was collected using a survey
   instrument. It was the comments written under questions by participants
   that were analysed in the present study.
   Findings: Three themes emerged: (1) increasing classroom interaction,
   (2) the importance of reflecting on emotions, and (3) need for
   experience.
   Discussion: Although this study has addressed delivery of education that
   relates to midwives, the findings are cross transferable to other
   healthcare educators, practitioners, and students. Several solutions are
   proposed that could potentially build student confidence to deliver
   bereavement care: lecturers should (1) encourage group discussion in the
   classroom to help build student confidence to emotionally cope during
   real bereavement events; (2) ensure students gain exposure by
   encouraging qualified midwives to include them in real bereavement
   events early on in their training, and (3) develop packages of perinatal
   bereavement scenarios for simulation and rehearsal in the clinical
   skills laboratory. Post-implementation, it is recommended that these
   teaching strategies be evaluated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {A practical algorithm for learning disjunctive abstraction heuristics in
   static program analysis},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {135},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Context: The precision and cost of static analysis are determined by
   abstraction heuristics (e.g., strategies for abstracting calling
   contexts, heap locations, etc.), but manually designing effective
   abstraction heuristics requires a huge amount of engineering effort and
   domain knowledge. Recently, data-driven static analysis has emerged to
   address this challenge by learning such heuristics automatically from a
   set of training programs. Objective: We present a practical algorithm
   for learning disjunctive abstraction heuristics in data-driven static
   analysis. We build on a recently proposed approach that can learn
   nontrivial program properties by disjunctive boolean functions. However,
   the existing approach is practically limited as it assumes that the most
   precise abstraction is cheap for the training programs; the algorithm is
   inapplicable if the most precise abstraction is not scalable. The
   objective of this paper is to mitigate this limitation. Method: Our
   algorithm overcomes the limitation with two new ideas. It systematically
   decomposes the learning problem into feasible subproblems, and it can
   search through the abstraction space from the coarse to fine-grained
   abstractions. With this approach, our algorithm is able to learn
   heuristics when static analysis with the most precise abstraction is not
   scalable over the training programs. Results: We show our approach is
   effective and generally applicable. We applied our approach to a context
   sensitive points-to analysis for Java and a flow-sensitive interval
   analysis for C. Experimental results show that our algorithm is
   efficient. For example, our algorithm can learn heuristics for
   3-object-sensitive analysis for which the existing learning algorithm is
   too expensive to learn any useful heuristics. Conclusion: Our algorithm
   makes a state-of-the-art technique for data-driven static analysis more
   practical.},

Title = {Systems Thinking and Systems-Based Practice Across the Health
   Professions: An Inquiry Into Definitions, Teaching Practices, and
   Assessment},
Journal = {TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {30},

Pages = {242-254},
Abstract = {Phenomenon: Systems thinking is the cornerstone of systems-based
   practice (SBP) and a core competency in medicine and health sciences.
   Literature regarding how to teach or apply systems thinking in practice
   is limited. This study aimed to understand how educators in medicine,
   physical therapy, physician assistant, nursing, and speech-language
   pathology education programs teach and assess systems thinking and SBP.
   Approach: Twenty-six educators from seven different degree programs
   across the five professions were interviewed and program descriptions
   and relevant course syllabi were reviewed. Qualitative analysis was
   iterative and incorporated inductive and deductive methods as well as a
   constant comparison of units of data to identify patterns and themes.
   Findings: Six themes were identified: 1) participants described systems
   thinking as ranging across four major levels of healthcare (i.e.,
   patient, care team, organization, and external environment); 2)
   participants associated systems thinking with a wide range of activities
   across the curriculum including quality improvement, Inter-professional
   education (IPE), error mitigation, and advocacy; 3) the need for
   healthcare professionals to understand systems thinking was primarily
   externally driven; 4) participants perceived that learning systems
   thinking occurred mainly informally and experientially rather than
   through formal didactic instruction; 5) participants characterized
   systems thinking content as interspersed across the curriculum and
   described a variety of strategies for teaching and assessing it; 6)
   participants indicated a structured framework and inter-professional
   approach may enhance teaching and assessment of systems thinking.
   Insights: Systems thinking means different things to different health
   professionals. Teaching and assessing systems thinking across the health
   professions will require further training and practice. Tools,
   techniques, taxonomies and expertise outside of healthcare may be used
   to enhance the teaching, assessment, and application of systems thinking
   and SBP to clinical practice; however, these would need to be adapted
   and refined for use in healthcare.},

Title = {A Hybrid Cloud and Edge Control Strategy for Demand Responses Using Deep
   Reinforcement Learning and Transfer Learning},

Abstract = {A number of electric devices in buildings can be considered as important
   demand response (DR) resources, for instance, the battery energy storage
   system (BESS) and the heat, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)
   systems. The conventional model-based DR methods rely on efficient
   on-demand computing resources. However, the current buildings suffer
   from the high cost of computing resources and lack a cost-effective
   automation system, which becomes the main obstacle to the popularization
   and implementation of the DR program. Therefore, in this paper, we
   present a hybrid cloud and edge control strategy for BESS and HVAC based
   on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). On the cloud infrastructure, the
   agent learns the control strategy online based on the proposed
   continuous dueling deep Q-learning (C-DDQN) algorithm, and the learned
   strategy is distributed to the edge devices for execution. Under this
   framework, the data-intensive application of cloud computing in
   real-time DR shows advantages in high processing speed, unlimited data
   aggregation, fault-tolerant, cost-saving, security, and confidentiality.
   However, if every controller is trained from the beginning, the cloud
   resources are wasted to a large extent. Therefore, we propose a transfer
   deep reinforcement learning methodology to transfer the control
   strategies between BESS and HVAC units. The transfer learning is
   realized based on fine-tuning and the proposed Evolving Domain
   Adaptation Network (EDAN). In case studies, it is verified that the
   proposed transfer deep reinforcement learning algorithm shows better
   convergence and learning capability compared with not applying transfer
   learning technologies. Compared with the conventional model-based
   method, the proposed methodology speeds up the decision-making time by
   10(5) times.},

Abstract = {Cross-aged teaching programs provide leadership experiences to youth who
   aim to influence children to be responsible, caring, and compassionate.
   Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a
   leadership development protocol on relationship development in an
   established cross-aged teaching program. Method: Guided by the
   developmental relationships framework, ``Simple Interactions{''} was
   implemented with a group of nine youth leaders. The intent was to help
   them improve their relationships with children in four categories (a)
   connection, (b) reciprocity, (c) participation, and (d) progression.
   Data were collected through reflection documents and focus group
   interviews. Results: Qualitative results explain how Simple Interactions
   impacted reflection and revealed strategies youth leaders used to build
   relationships with children. Discussion: The findings suggest that the
   Simple Interactions protocol may provide an innovative strategy to
   promote reflective practice and develop positive relationships in a
   cross-aged teaching program.},

Abstract = {Contribution: A technical course in a multidisciplinary university
   program has to provide high-level skills, with limited lecturing hours
   and student background. This article investigates the principles for its
   design and reports about a study case. Background: The overall course
   organization needs to address specific learning targets and teaching
   techniques, different from those used in traditional courses on the
   topic. Research Question: A stepwise strategy assists a principled
   design that allows dynamic, long-term improvements. Methodology: The
   evaluation of its applicability requires a years-long record of
   historical data. The article studies the evolution of a course over six
   years using simple monitoring techniques: surveys and rubric-based
   examinations. Findings: Monitoring emerges as an essential feature for
   course evolution: a focused examination provides the best results, while
   institutional, wide-spectrum surveys appear to be of little help.},

Abstract = {The promotion of academic programs, particularly at graduate levels,
   emerges as a response to market changes. In general, graduate programs
   are not a first order necessity which makes necessary the right
   promotion of such programs guarantee the attraction of prospective
   students, which enroll in some of them, which is essential for the
   financial sustainability of universities. Notably, the last one is a
   crucial problem for private universities. In this paper, we analyze the
   prospective students that enroll in a private to design better promotion
   strategies by using on data gathered by online sources. Specifically, we
   use clustering techniques to define marketing strategies based on
   segments of students. We find that age and city are crucial to promoting
   graduate programs while marital status and sex does not impact the
   decision of students in the university that we analyze.},

Abstract = {Objective. To assess preceptor teaching challenges and development
   programming design preferences through a qualitative needs assessment of
   Doctor of Pharmacy student and resident preceptors.
   Methods. In 2018, 148 experiential education stakeholders across North
   Carolina (eg, preceptors, residency program directors, experiential
   faculty administrators, and practice site administrators) were invited
   to participate in a 60-minute semi-structured interview as part of a
   broad preceptor development needs assessment. Interview questions
   focused on: precepting challenges, positive and negative features of
   development programs, and preferences for program design. Interview
   transcripts were coded using thematic analysis.
   Results. Forty-two participants completed interviews, including
   preceptors from various rotation types, residency program directors,
   experiential faculty administrators, and institution administrators.
   Participants identified numerous teaching challenges related to
   learners, preceptors, and institutional level factors. Participants
   often noted there was inadequate time, resources, and support to
   effectively teach. Desirable preceptor development program features
   included practical strategies, collaboration with preceptors, delivery
   by education and practice experts, and topics specific to precepting
   experience. Participants identified live, on-demand, and webinar formats
   as acceptable if collaboration and engagement were included.
   Participants also desired unique training opportunities such as online
   platforms, coaching programs, and simulated learning environments.
   Conclusion. Preceptors for pharmacy students and residents face numerous
   challenges and require sufficient time, support, and resources to
   develop their skills. Participants requested training that included
   on-demand, frequent sessions delivered through various modalities,
   collaboration opportunities, a choice in topics and delivery formats,
   and sessions from educational and practice experts.},

Abstract = {Purpose To assess use of the combined just-in-time teaching (JiTT) and
   peer instruction (PI) instructional strategy in a residency program's
   core curriculum.
   Method In 2010-2011, JiTT/PI was piloted in 31 core curriculum sessions
   taught by 22 faculty in the Northwestern University Feinberg School of
   Medicine's general surgery residency program. JiTT/PI required
   preliminary and categorical residents (n = 31) to complete Web-based
   study questions before weekly specialty topic sessions. Responses were
   examined by faculty members just in time to tailor session content to
   residents' learning needs. In the sessions, residents answered
   multiple-choice questions (MCQs) using clickers and engaged in PI.
   Participants completed surveys assessing their perceptions of JiTT/PI.
   Videos were coded to assess resident engagement time in JiTT/PI sessions
   versus prior lecture-based sessions. Responses to topic session MCQs
   repeated in review sessions were evaluated to study retention.
   Results More than 70\% of resident survey respondents indicated that
   JiTT/PI aided in the learning of key points. At least 90\% of faculty
   survey respondents reported positive perceptions of aspects of the
   JiTT/PI strategy. Resident engagement time for JiTT/PI sessions was
   significantly greater than for prior lecture-based sessions (z = -2.4, P
   = .016). Significantly more review session MCQ responses were correct
   for residents who had attended corresponding JiTT/PI sessions than for
   residents who had not (chi-square = 13.7; df = 1; P < .001).
   Conclusions JiTT/PI increased learner participation, learner retention,
   and the amount of learner-centered time. JiTT/PI represents an effective
   approach for meaningful and active learning in core curriculum sessions.},

Title = {Project-based learning as a strategy for multi-level training applied to
   undergraduate engineering students},

Abstract = {This study presents a project-based learning methodology whose
   particularity is the inclusion of training at different levels of
   undergraduate engineering programs, which allows for the interaction
   among students from different semesters who work together on a common
   project. To show the applicability of the proposed methodology, a
   project for the industrial production of ethanol from sugar cane was
   considered. Students enrolled in Process Design (9th semester) and
   Computer-Assisted Technical Design (5th semester), courses included in
   the engineering programs offered by the Department of Chemical
   Engineering at Yachay Tech University (Ecuador), jointly developed it.
   The details of the project were presented to the students of the
   Introduction to Engineering course (3rd semester) to boost their
   interest in the engineering as applied science. The activities carried
   out in each of the courses are described in detail together with a
   description of how the learning outcomes were achieved thanks to the
   implementation of a multi-level training strategy. Teamwork and
   collaborative-integrated learning are the elements highlighted by the
   students who participated in the project. Some of the innovative aspects
   of the proposed methodology include professional training and
   multi-level learning, the development of logical thinking typical of
   engineers, the knowledge handover associated with the professional
   activities of process engineers engaged with real-world projects.
   Additionally, this methodology prizes the industrial experience that
   professors at the undergraduate level may have by allowing them to
   contribute with an engineering vision to the training of young people in
   engineering projects. This study was inspired by the principle of
   Constructive Alignment and by goal \# 4 (quality education) of the 2030
   Agenda for Sustainable Development. (C) 2020 Institution of Chemical

Title = {Can In-Home Laboratories Foster Learning, Self-Efficacy, and Motivation
   During the COVID-19 Pandemic?-A Case Study in Two Engineering Programs},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},

Pages = {310-321},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has represented a challenge for higher education
   in terms to provide quality education despite the lockdown periods, the
   transformation of the in-person classes to virtual classes, and the
   demotivation and anxiety that are experimented by the students. Because
   the basis of engineering is the experimentation through hands-on
   activities and learning by doing, the lockdown periods and the temporary
   suspension of the in-person classes and laboratories have meant a
   problem for educators that try to teach and motivate the students
   despite the situation. In this context, this study presents an
   educational methodology based on Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and
   in-home laboratories in engineering. The methodology was carried out in
   two phases during 2020, in the academic programs of Industrial
   Engineering and Technology in Electronics with (n = 44) students. The
   in-home laboratories were sent to the students as part of ``kits{''}with
   the devices needed in each subject. Besides, due to the difficulties in
   monitoring the learning process, the students made videos and blogs as a
   strategy to reinforce their learning and evidence the progress in the
   courses. The outcomes of the methodology show mainly the following
   points: (1) An improvement of the academic performance and learning of
   the students in the courses. (2) A positive influence of the usage of
   in-home laboratories in motivation, self-efficacy, and reduction of
   anxiety. (3) Positive correlations between the usage of in-home
   laboratories, the blogs and videos, and the teacher's feedback for
   learning, motivation, and self-efficacy. Thus, these results evidence
   that other alternatives that gather the cognitive and affective learning
   domains can emerge from engineering to deal with the educational
   problems produced by the crisis periods. Although the methodology and
   the lessons learned in this study are applied to the pandemic period,
   they can be extended in engineering education to the post-pandemic
   period.},

Title = {Learning outcomes of a flipped classroom teaching approach in an
   adult-health nursing course: a quasi-experimental study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 18},
Abstract = {Background New teaching strategies must be developed not only to enhance
   nurse's competence but also to allow nurses to respond to the complex
   health care needs of today's society. The purpose of this study was to
   explore the learning outcomes of a flipped classroom teaching approach
   in an adult-health nursing course for students in a two-year Bachelor of
   Science in Nursing program. Methods The study had a quasi-experimental
   design. An 18-week flipped classroom teaching approach was applied in an
   adult-health nursing course. In total, 485 nursing students enrolled in
   the study, with 287 in the experimental group and 198 in the control
   group. The Self-Evaluated Core Competencies Scale, Metacognitive
   Inventory for Nursing Students, Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale,
   and self-designed learning satisfaction questionnaire were used to
   evaluate the students' learning outcomes. Results The experimental group
   showed a statistically significant increase in the overall scores for
   self-evaluated core competencies, the ``self-modification{''} subscale
   of the Metacognitive Inventory for Nursing Students, and in overall
   self-directed learning readiness; further, they also showed high levels
   of course satisfaction. Conclusions A flipped classroom teaching
   approach had a positive impact on student's learning motivation and
   contributed to better learning outcomes in an adult-health nursing
   course. The flipped classroom combined with hybrid teaching methods is a
   suitable and effective learning strategy for a registered nurse (RN) to
   Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program to tackle today's complex
   revolution in nursing curricula, and may enhance nursing students'
   abilities to address numerous challenges.},

Abstract = {Anatomy has served as a cornerstone in the training of various allied
   and clinical disciplines and has traditionally been based on dissection
   of the human body. Thus, to pursue this method of teaching and learning,
   access to cadavers is of continuing importance. Over a significant
   period of time unclaimed cadavers have performed an essential role in
   the teaching of anatomy in South Africa and in Africa. As recent cadaver
   numbers were declining at the School of Anatomical Sciences, University
   of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg and difficulty in procurement was
   being experienced, the purpose of this study was to critically evaluate
   the composition of our cadaver population over time so as to provide
   possible strategies to arrest the decline. A retrospective, quantitative
   analysis of cadaver records from the School of Anatomical Sciences
   between 1921 and 2013 was undertaken. Analysis included a comparison of
   Poisson counts and Fischer's exact test. A significant decrease in the
   number of cadavers received during the period 2000-2013 and a slow
   bequest program over the same period of time has led to concerns about
   the sustainability of teaching anatomy through dissection. Decreases in
   the numbers of males and cadavers of the black population group occurred
   between 1990 and 2013, and of bequests from 2000 to 2013. An influence
   on the cadaver population from a changing political climate and change
   in socioeconomic status of part of the population was perceived. Changes
   in sex and population group of the cadavers may have a long-term effect
   on teaching and research. Anat Sci Educ 8: 445-451. (c) 2014 American

Abstract = {This paper reviews the current status and focus of Australian
   Architecture programs with respect to Indigenous Knowledge and the
   extent to which these tertiary programs currently address reconciliation
   and respect to Indigenous Australians in relation to their professional
   institutions and accreditation policies. The paper draws upon the
   findings of a recently completed investigation of current teaching:
   Re-Casting terra nullius blindness: Empowering Indigenous Protocols and
   Knowledge in Australian University Built Environment Education. Three
   data sets from this investigation are analysed: a desktop survey of
   Australian Built Environment curricula; workshops with tertiary
   providers and students, professional practitioners and representatives
   of three Built Environment professional institutes; and an online survey
   of Australian Built Environment students (of which their discipline
   could be isolated) ascertaining what is currently being taught and
   learned and what changes would be feasible within the constraints of
   courses from their perspective. Detailed descriptions are also provided
   of pedagogic improvements informed by the project findings. The findings
   suggest minimal current exposure of Architecture students to Indigenous
   Knowledge content beyond voluntary engagement in self-chosen thesis
   projects and elective (including studio) subjects led by passionate but
   largely unsupported teachers championing Indigenous issues; a paucity of
   teaching echoed by practitioners and accreditors who acknowledge lack of
   expertise in this area across the profession. This paper discusses ways
   in which Indigenous Knowledge might be better acknowledged, respected
   and introduced to Australian Architecture students' education. Also
   discussed are teaching strategies with global relevance.},

Title = {A structured reflection-based graphic organizer approach for
   professional training: A technology-supported AQSR approach},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {183},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The mission of professional training is to foster learners' abilities to
   perform analysis and to carry out problem-solving. During the process of
   professional training, how to promote learners' selfefficacy,
   re-organization, and reflection is the key to boosting their
   problem-solving abilities. However, conventional professional training
   programs tend to rely on teachers' elaboration of basic knowledge and
   cases. They also use graphical organizers for knowledge organization.
   The main focus of this learning method aims at promoting learners'
   memory and assisting their comprehension of the overall structure of the
   knowledge. However, learners who use this method often fail to develop a
   deep understanding of the relationship of different cases without
   additional supports. To solve this problem, this study proposed a
   technology-enhanced Annotation, Questioning, Summarization, and
   Reflection (AQSR) training approach which uses a graphic organizer to
   guide trainees to gain knowledge during the process of comprehending and
   organizing learning content. To evaluate the effectiveness of these
   strategies, a quasi-experiment was conducted to compare the performances
   of the AQSR-based graphic organizer approach and the conventional
   graphic organizer-based training. The participants were new nursing
   staff who were enrolled in two classes of a training program. From the
   experimental results, it was found that the nursing staff who used the
   AQSR training approach showed significantly better learning achievements
   and case analysis test scores as well as more positive learning
   attitudes than those who used the conventional graphic organizer-based
   training, showing the potential of the proposed approach for
   professional training.},

Title = {Development of an interprofessional task-based learning program in the
   field of occupational health: a content validity study},

Abstract = {Objective One of the duties of the educational system is to provide
   situations in which students learn the tasks corresponding to their
   future careers in an interprofessional team. This study was designed to
   develop an interprofessional task-based training program. Methods This
   was a curriculum development study conducted by content validity
   methodology in two stages: 1) `framework development' which resulted in
   the creation of the framework items; and 2) `evaluation of the
   framework' (judgment and quantification). The first stage consisted of
   task identification, generation of sub-tasks, and assimilation of items
   into a usable format. The second stage consisted of the judgment
   -quantification of the content validity of items and the framework.
   After that, the framework of the tasks of the occupational health team
   was finalized in the expert panel. After explaining the tasks, a matrix
   for task-expected roles in the occupational health team and a matrix for
   task-required skills to perform each task were developed. The next step
   determined the appropriate teaching and assessment methods for each
   task. Finally, an expert panel reviewed and approved the components of
   the interprofessional task-based training program. Results Integrating
   the interprofessional education strategy with task-based learning was
   considered innovative in occupational health team training. In the
   development stage, 48 items were extracted, and then 35 tasks were
   generated in the step of identification of tasks. In the second step,
   174 sub-tasks were developed. The tasks and sub-tasks were categorized
   into seven areas. After the stage of evaluation of the framework, 33
   tasks were categorized into seven main areas, including ``assessment and
   identification of workplace hazards `` (n = 10), ``control of
   occupational hazards `` (n = 4), ``determining the appropriate job
   position for each person `` (n = 3), ``occupational health examinations
   `` (n = 6), ``management of occupational/work-related diseases `` (n =
   5), ``inter-organizational and inter-disciplinary relations, and legal
   judgment `` (n = 3) and ``education and scholarship in occupational
   health services `` (n = 2). Conclusion The results of the present study
   can be used in developing the use of the interprofessional strategy and
   task-based training as two appropriate strategies for the purposeful
   development of learners' abilities in the fields involved in providing
   occupational health services in their future careers.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on determining the elements of problem solving
   strategies that occur during Project-based Laboratory (PB Lab) teaching
   and learning (T\&L) activities. Problem solving strategies are defined
   as strategies which significantly relate to the elements involved in
   problem solving procedures that guide students to solve problems during
   T\&L activities. Four groups, each of which consists of five students
   and one PB Lab facilitator, were observed. Seven PB Lab facilitators
   were interviewed. The respondents are from the Bachelor of Electrical
   Engineering (Power) (SEE) program in the Faculty of Electrical
   Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. This qualitative research
   employed the thematic analysis technique in determining the themes
   related to the elements of problem solving strategies that occurred
   during the PB Lab activities. The results of the analysis have indicated
   that there are five main processes associated with the problem solving
   elements that took place during the PB Lab course activities, which led
   to enhancing the students' problem solving skills in the laboratory
   context.},

Abstract = {The growing number of students can be a challenge for teaching
   visualization lectures, supervision, evaluation, and grading. Moreover,
   designing visualization courses by matching the different experiences
   and skills of the students is a major goal in order to find a common
   solvable task for all of them. Particularly, the given task is important
   to follow a common project goal, to collaborate in small project groups,
   but also to further experience, learn, or extend programming skills. In
   this article, we survey our experiences from teaching 116 student
   project groups of 6 bachelor courses on information visualization with
   varying topics. Moreover, two teaching strategies were tried: 2 courses
   were held without lectures and assignments but with weekly scrum
   sessions (further denoted by TS1) and 4 courses were guided by weekly
   lectures and assignments (further denoted by TS2). A total number of 687
   students took part in all of these 6 courses. Managing the ever growing
   number of students in computer and data science is a big challenge in
   these days, i.e., the students typically apply a design-based active
   learning scenario while being supported by weekly lectures, assignments,
   or scrum sessions. As a major outcome, we identified a regular
   supervision either by lectures and assignments or by regular scrum
   sessions as important due to the fact that the students were relatively
   unexperienced bachelor students with a wide range of programming skills,
   but nearly no visualization background. In this article, we explain
   different subsequent stages to successfully handle the upcoming problems
   and describe how much supervision was involved in the development of the
   visualization project. The project task description is given in a way
   that it has a minimal number of requirements but can be extended in many
   directions while most of the decisions are up to the students like
   programming languages, visualization approaches, or interaction
   techniques. Finally, we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of both
   teaching strategies.},

Pages = {287-297},
Abstract = {Lifelong learning plays a fundamental role for all engineering
   professionals, including engineering educators, as the working context
   is now international and rapidly changing. The training and professional
   development of engineering educators are hence of vital importance for
   letting universities serve society. In this study, the main challenges
   for the promotion of well-trained and change-oriented engineering
   educators are methodically analyzed, as linked to preparing the future
   generations of engineers. A systematic analysis of such challenges is
   performed and helps with the finding of unsolved or critical aspects,
   which can be grouped into main problems. After studying them, a
   collection of actuations or potential solutions, together with a set of
   tools for checking their progress, are put forward. Key strategies
   directly involve teachers themselves and their teaching methodologies,
   implicate students and the relationships with educators, take advantage
   of available resources and are dependent on the surrounding environment.
   Their effects are discussed, based on authors' experience, and
   considering the information from the studies carried out by numerous
   colleagues worldwide.},

Abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a new dawn of artificial intelligence (AI),
   in which machine learning models are constructed in a distributed manner
   while communicating only model parameters between a centralized
   aggregator and client internet-of-medical-things (IoMT) nodes. The
   performance of such a learning technique can be seriously hampered by
   the activities of a malicious jammer robot. In this paper, we study
   client selection and channel allocation along with the power control
   problem of the uplink FL process in IoMT domain under the presence of a
   jammer from the perspective of long-term learning duration. We map the
   interaction between the FL network and the jammer in each learning
   iteration as a Stackelberg game, in which the jammer acts as the leader
   and the FL network serves as the follower. We consider the client and
   channel selection as well as the power control jointly as the strategy
   of this game. Upon formulating the game, we find the joint best response
   strategy for both types of players by leveraging the difference of
   convex (DC) programming approach and the dual decomposition technique.
   Beside the availability of the complete information to both the players,
   we also study the problem from the perspective that the FL network knows
   the partial information of the other player. Extensive simulations have
   been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in
   the jamming game.},

Abstract = {Students in the natural sciences should be prepared as undergraduates to
   read and apply concepts from the scientific literature. I describe a
   strategy that enforced the necessity to deliver high volumes of content
   while incorporating an active-learning technique. Students were assigned
   to read and discuss articles from the scientific literature that
   complemented content being delivered via traditional lecture. Students
   were encouraged to participate by coming to class prepared with written
   questions, and discussion was directed by instructor-prepared prompts.
   Students were assessed via low-stakes assignments based primarily on
   participation. This teaching method has proved effective, as verbally
   reported by past students who are currently enrolled in graduate
   programs. These students report feeling more prepared than their peers
   to discuss and learn from the scientific literature.},

Title = {Examining the implementation of teaching and learning interactions of
   transition cultural competence through a qualitative study of Taiwan
   mentors untaking the postgraduate nursing program},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {79},
Pages = {74-79},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: Cultural competency has been identified as an essential
   curricular element in undergraduate and graduate nursing programmes.
   Supporting successful transition to practice is essential for retaining
   graduate nurses in the workforce and meeting the demand for cultural
   diversity in health care services.
   Objectives: This study aimed to explore the teaching and learning
   interactions of transition cultural competence from the perspective of
   mentors of newly graduated nurses in a Taiwanese postgraduate nursing
   programme.
   Design: A qualitative design that utilised focus group interviews was
   adopted for this study. A framework approach a content and thematic
   analysis strategy was used to analyse the interviews.
   Setting The study setting consisted of two hospitals in northern Taiwan.
   Participants: The study participants consisted of 24 new graduate nurse
   mentors.
   Methods: Three focus group sessions were conducted (two at a medical
   centre and one at a district hospital), where the participants were
   interviewed.
   Results: Four themes were derived from the data transition process,
   teaching strategies according to the transition stage, learning after
   overcoming clinical stress, and awareness of cultural diversity among
   new graduate nurses. The clinical routine and physical stress of caring
   for patients did not allow the newly graduated nurses to appropriately
   demonstrate cultural competence in the first three months. Mentors were
   only able to provide resources for new graduate nurses when they first
   started to care for patients in cultural groups. The point of catalysis
   was when learners finally gained awareness of cultural differences, and,
   consequently, they could encounter the teaching and learning process.
   Conclusion: The different learning stages and teaching strategies
   illustrated the interactive process between new nurses and educators.
   Facilitating the cultural awareness of learners is a challenge for
   teachers who provide cultural competence training. This model could
   serve as a reference for curriculum and clinical training programmes.},

Title = {Prediction of Online Video Advertising Inventory Based on TV Programs: A
   Deep Learning Approach},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {22516-22527},
Abstract = {With the recent spread of digital content, patterns of media viewing
   have changed. This is especially true for programs formerly watched on
   TV but are now increasingly viewed through online videos. As more and
   more people watch online videos, the market for online video advertising
   is increasing. Including online video advertising, online advertising
   can be effective if advertisers and online service providers attract as
   many viewers as possible. In particular, service providers try to
   maximize their profits by efficiently selling advertising inventory,
   which indicates the volume of space available for advertisements.
   However, most of today's service providers use simple statistical
   applications to predict advertising inventory that leads to relatively
   inaccurate predictions. Therefore, this study aims to develop a model
   capable of accurately predicting advertising inventory and then validate
   the model. This study in predicting online video advertising inventory
   is based on using deep learning to analyze the raw data of online video
   channels and then comparing the results of these predictions with actual
   inventory, other results of machine learning techniques, and work-site
   method results. Using these techniques and approaches, future
   advertising inventory can be more accurately predicted. In addition,
   detailed strategies for the practice of online video advertising are
   suggested.},

Abstract = {Sustainability science has been gaining traction within academic
   research and teaching over the past few decades, and it is now entering
   a phase of greater maturity as a discipline, with links to sectors
   beyond the academy including energy, finance, advocacy, development,
   design, construction, agriculture, and healthcare. Concurrently, the
   growth of the internet has spurred innovation in platform development.
   This convergence has generated technology-enabled opportunities for
   training sustainability scholars and practitioners grounded in active
   learning pedagogies. Case studies are one active learning strategy
   becoming established within the fields of environment and
   sustainability. However, the traditional case study form and mode of
   delivery, which excel at a retroactive analysis of strategic
   decision-making and outcomes, can create challenges for teaching about
   issues involving emergent technologies and rapidly changing scientific
   and social dimensions. This article describes one novel platform, called
   Gala, for teaching and learning about sustainability science through
   case studies that address these challenges. Gala closely integrates text
   and multimedia components, is easily updated, and embraces content
   consumers as content creators and vice versa. We also report here the
   results of one pilot study that investigated differences between
   graduate and undergraduate student interactions with different case
   components. Results indicate that both groups heavily used the case
   narrative, but varied in their use of multimedia components. Such
   insights into patterns of case use are informing decisions about
   improvements to Gala and directions for future case production,
   teaching, and assessment, in order to create better tools for teaching
   and learning about sustainability.},

Title = {A Software Products Line as Educational Tool to Learn Industrial Robots
   Programming with Arduino},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Software reuse has potential for educational purposes since it uses
   decomposition and abstraction, two necessary skills to learn
   programming. Software reuse techniques require abstractions that are not
   obvious to students or even to professionals. Taking advantage of these
   techniques, students can learn computer programming in a productive and
   organized way. This paper proposes to use the Software Product Line
   (SPL) reuse technique as a strategy for learning to program industrial
   robots with the Arduino platform. First, the paper explains SPL
   construction and application with first-year university students. The
   SPL proposes abstractions close to the industrial robots domain with a
   simplified variability. The paper uses the case study method to show the
   feasibility of using the SPL approach in a learning environment. In this
   evaluation, students reused 38\% to 43\% of the total code needed to
   program the robot. It represents an improvement in the time it takes
   students to program industrial robotics solutions facilitating their
   learning. In addition, the paper unveils some limitations related to
   usability, specific knowledge, and some exploitable technologies.},

Title = {Understanding Female Students' Choice of a Construction Management
   Undergraduate Degree Program: Case Study at an Australian University},

Abstract = {The considerably low female student enrollments in construction
   management (CM) undergraduate degree programs have continued to draw
   attention from academia. With a cohort of local and international female
   students in a CM program in an Australian university, this case study
   examined the students' CM degree choice decision, their learning
   experience, the strategies for attracting more female students to CM
   programs, and recommendations were made for CM program recruitment
   efforts based on the findings. The interview results show that, for both
   local and international student groups, their personal interest in
   construction and career opportunities were the most important factors
   that influenced their CM degree choice decision. For the international
   student group, however, there were additional influencing factors
   including immigration opportunities after graduation, financial
   considerations, program entry requirements, and program duration.
   Although the international students would like to have support in
   finding internships, both student groups generally had positive learning
   experiences in their studies. Both student groups identified the need to
   advertise more about CM programs as a part of recruitment strategies. It
   is recommended that information and resources about CM programs be made
   readily accessible to current and future CM students, high school
   counselors, and education service providers in a timely manner via
   social media platforms and the Internet.},

Title = {Time-series event-based prediction: An unsupervised learning framework
   based on genetic programming},
Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {301},
Pages = {99-123},
Month = {APR 20},
Abstract = {In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning framework based on
   Genetic Programming (GP) to predict the position of any particular
   target event (defined by the user) in a time-series. GP is used to
   automatically build a library of candidate temporal features. The
   proposed framework receives a training set S = \{(V-a)vertical bar a = 0
   ... n\}, where each V-a is a time-series vector such that for all V-a is
   an element of S, V-a = \{(x(t))vertical bar t = 0...-t(max)\} where
   t(max) is the size of the time-series. All V-a is an element of S are
   assumed to be generated from the same environment. The proposed
   framework uses a divide-and-conquer strategy for the training phase. The
   training process of the proposed framework works as follow. The user
   specifies the target event that needs to be predicted (e.g., Highest
   value, Second Highest value, ..., etc.). Then, the framework classifies
   the training samples into different Bins, where Bins = \{(b(i))vertical
   bar i = 0... t(max)\}, based on the time-slot t of the target event in
   each V-a training sample. Each b(i) is an element of Bins will contain a
   subset of S. For each b(i), the proposed framework further classifies
   its samples into statistically independent clusters. To achieve this,
   each b(i) is treated as an independent problem where GP is used to
   evolve programs to extract statistical features from each b(i)'s members
   and classify them into different clusters using the K-Means algorithm.
   At the end of the training process, GP is used to build an `event
   detector' that receives an unseen time-series and predicts the time-slot
   where the target event is expected to occur. Empirical evidence on
   artificially generated data and real-world data shows that the proposed
   framework significantly outperforms standard Radial Basis Function
   Networks, standard GP system, Gaussian Process regression, Linear
   regression, and Polynomial Regression. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Changes in Pharmacy Students? Self-Reported Learning Strategies Across a

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},

Abstract = {Objective. Few studies describe changes in students' class preparation,
   note-taking, and examination preparation over the course of professional
   school. This study aims to describe the use of these learning and study
   strategies by pharmacy students and to analyze changes during their
   education.Methods. We performed a prospective, observational cohort
   study of students at a single US pharmacy school from 2016-2019.
   Students completed an online survey on learning and study strategies at
   the beginning of each school year. Quantitative results were analyzed by
   level in pharmacy school during which the survey was completed as the
   primary predictor. Open-ended responses were thematically analyzed using
   an inductive approach.Results. We observed significant changes in
   strategies, including an increased use of audiovisual materials for
   course preparation, preference for electronic over manual notetaking,
   increasing use of lecture capture viewing, and increased use of peer
   materials in studying. Changes were generally largest between students'
   first (P1) and second (P2) years in pharmacy school, representing
   adjustments in student beha-viors during the P1 year. In some cases,
   changes from the surveys in the P1 to P2 years were followed by a
   gradual return toward P1 survey levels. Three themes described students'
   comments: students' preferences shaped their learning strategies, their
   experiences guided changes in learning strategies, and they used
   additional strategies beyond those included in the survey
   items.Conclusions. Significant changes in pharmacy student study
   strategies occurred over the course of their education. This may
   represent an opportunity to promote use of more effective approaches for
   long-term learning.},

Abstract = {Multiagent systems (MASs) courses are nowadays present in most master's
   degrees in Artificial Intelligence. In such courses, students have to
   cope with the gap between some high-level theoretical concepts and
   techniques that allow agents to reach agreements in order successfully
   cooperate (the so-called Agreement Technologies) and their corresponding
   implementations to be used in real programs. If the learning outcomes of
   such courses include the development of actual (although reasonably
   simple) MASs, the incorporation of some strategy to make students
   enhance their initial programming skills becomes crucial for their
   success. In this context, this article presents both a tool called
   SimFleet and a teaching methodology that have been designed together to
   guide students throughout a typical MASs course and, specifically, to
   enhance their programming skills in order learn how to develop actual
   MASs.},

Title = {Break out of the Classroom: The Use of Escape Rooms as an Alternative
   Teaching Strategy in Surgical Education},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To implement and assess the impact of a Vascular
   Surgery-themed Escape Room on medical student motivation, satisfaction,
   and engagement in CandMEDS roles.
   DESIGN: The authors designed an Escape Room combining Vascular Surgery
   objectives, knowledge-based problems and technical skills into Vascular
   Surgery-themed stations. Groups of 3 to 4 medical students participated
   in the activity. Data collected included time to escape, CanMEDS roles
   covered during the activity, debriefing interview session, and
   satisfaction survey.
   SETTING: The Escape Room was installed at the University of Ottawa
   Skills and Simulation Centre at the Ottawa Hospital, a tertiary care
   center.
   PARTICIPANTS: Medical students in their preclerkship years of study were
   invited to participate in the Escape Room. In total, 13 medical students
   completed the experience, divided into 4 groups.
   RESULTS: Thirteen medical students divided into 4 groups participated in
   the Escape Room. Two teams used a collaborative strategy to complete the
   activity and successfully escaped with an average time of 53.6 minutes,
   whereas only 1 of the 2 teams completing the experience employing an
   individualistic strategy successfully escaped. Following the experience,
   83\% of participants stated that the experience motivated them to
   prepare beforehand and believed that the experience consolidated the
   knowledge that they had read. All the participants also reported that
   the experience encouraged the use of the CanMEDS communicator and
   collaborator roles. As well, 76.9\% of students mentioned that they
   enjoyed the practical exercises incorporated into the experience and
   53.8\% stated that they would like to see the Escape Room format
   included in the medical curriculum.
   CONCLUSIONS: By combining knowledge-based problems, key learning
   objectives, technical skills, and CanMEDS themes into the Escape Room,
   the authors have developed a learning platform that may be more
   enjoyable and provide an adjunct to traditional didactic lectures. ((C)

Title = {A comparison of educational strategies for the acquisition of nursing
   student's performance and critical thinking: simulation-based training
   vs. integrated training (simulation and critical thinking strategies)},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Background: There is a need to change the focus of nursing education
   from traditional teacher-centered training programs to student-centered
   active methods. The integration of the two active learning techniques
   will improve the effectiveness of training programs. The objective of
   this study is to compare the effects of the integrated training
   (simulation and critical thinking strategies) and simulation-based
   training on the performance level and critical thinking ability of
   nursing students.
   Methods: The present quasi-experimental study was performed in 2014 on
   40 students who were studying practical nursing principles and skills
   course in the first half of the academic year in Shiraz University of
   Medical Sciences. Students were randomly divided into control (n = 20)
   and experimental (n = 20) groups. After training students through
   simulation and integrated education (simulation and critical thinking
   strategies), the students' critical thinking ability and performance
   were evaluated via the use of California Critical Thinking Ability
   Questionnaire B (CCTST) and Objective Structured Clinical Examination
   (OSCE) comprising 10 stations, respectively. The external reliability of
   the California Critical Thinking questionnaire was reported by Case B.
   to be between 0.78 and 0.80 and the validity of OSCE was approved by 5
   members of the faculty. Furthermore, by using Split Half method (the
   correlation between odd and even stations), the reliability of the test
   was approved with correlation coefficient of 0.66. Data were analyzed
   using t-test and Mann-Whitney test. A significance level of 0.05 was
   considered to be statistically significant.
   Results: The mean scores of the experimental group performance level
   were higher than the mean score of the control group performance level.
   This difference was statistically significant and students in the
   experimental group in OSCE stations had significantly higher performance
   than the control group (P < 0.001). However, the mean scores obtained
   for the critical thinking did not increase before and after the
   intervention.
   Conclusion: The results showed that, the students' performance level was
   increased by the application of integrated training (simulation and
   critical thinking strategies).},

Abstract = {Data gathered from 357 undergraduate and graduate teacher education
   students were analyzed to assess the ability of the Synthesis of
   Qualitative Data (SQD) instrument to measure six teaching strategies
   (role models, reflection, collaboration, feedback, instructional design
   and authentic experiences) important for preparing future teachers to
   use technology in their future teaching. Factor analysis,
   multidimensional scaling, and analysis of variance techniques were
   applied to the 24 SQD items developed through qualitative assessment of
   effective strategies needed to prepare teachers, in order to assess
   reliability and validity for six unique four-item scales. Findings were
   that all scales exhibited acceptable performance characteristics as
   independent measures, implying that future studies could use subsets of
   the items rather than the full 24-item instrument. Recommended areas of
   future research and practical implications for teacher preparation
   programs are discussed.},

Abstract = {It is still controversial whether learning styles are unchangeable
   dispositions or flexible characteristics. Research on the development of
   learning styles is therefore in high demand. We suggest a conceptual
   model that describes both explicit and implicit cognitive processes
   involved in processing instructional material. We also propose an
   implicit association test (learning styles IAT). In a first study (N =
   126), we evaluate the stimulus material for the IAT. In a second study
   (N = 104), we investigate the correlations between the implicit and
   explicit measures used. We further examine interactions between learning
   styles and learning outcomes as well as cognitive load. Two versions of
   a computer-based learning program (verbal vs. visual presentation of
   information) were used. The results reveal that matching learning styles
   and learning materials neither leads to better learning outcomes nor to
   a lower cognitive load. Additionally, neither implicit nor explicit
   measures were able to predict learning outcomes.},

Title = {The Taxonomy of Opportunities to Learn (TxOTL): a tool for understanding
   the learning potential and substance of interactions in faculty (online)
   learning community meetings},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Background While many research-based instructional strategies in STEM
   have been developed, faculty need support in implementing and sustaining
   use of these strategies. A number of STEM faculty professional
   development programs aim to provide such pedagogical support, and it is
   necessary to understand the activity and learning process for faculty in
   these settings. In this paper, a taxonomy for describing the learning
   opportunities in faculty (online) learning community meetings is
   presented. Faculty learning communities, meeting either in-person or
   (increasingly) online, are a common form of professional development.
   They aim to develop the pedagogical and reflective skills of
   participants through regular meetings centered on conversations about
   teaching and learning. Results The tool presented in this paper, the
   Taxonomy of Opportunities to Learn (TxOTL), provides a structured
   approach to making sense of the dynamic interactions that occur during
   faculty learning community meetings. The origins and development of the
   TxOTL are described, followed by a detailed presentation of the
   constructs that make up the TxOTL: communicative approach used in a
   conversation, the concepts developed, and the meeting segment category.
   The TxOTL characterizes the learning opportunities presented by a
   faculty learning community conversation through describing the content
   of the conversation as well as how participants engage in the
   conversation. Examples of the tool in use are provided through an
   application to a faculty online learning community serving instructors
   of a physical science curriculum. A visual representation used to
   compactly display the results of applying the taxonomy to a meeting is
   detailed as well. These examples serve to illustrate the types of claims
   the TxOTL facilitates. Conclusions The TxOTL allows one to examine
   learning opportunities available to a faculty learning community group,
   analyze concept development present in their conversations, track change
   over time in a given group, and identify patterns between meeting
   segment categories and communicative approaches. It is useful for
   researchers as well as facilitators of these STEM faculty professional
   development groups. The taxonomy is most applicable to faculty (online)
   learning communities, with limited use for workshops and K-12
   professional development contexts.},

Title = {Learning English reading in a mobile-assisted extensive reading program},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {78},
Pages = {48-59},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Previous studies on Extensive Reading Programs (ERPs) have reached
   positive conclusions, namely, that an ERP for language learners is
   effective in improving their linguistic abilities related to reading and
   promoting their motivation and attitudes toward reading. Current mobile
   devices, even though suitable for reading, have not yet been applied to
   develop language learners' linguistic proficiency and affective
   abilities in any ERP. The aim of the present study was to address this
   gap in literature by investigating the effects of using mobile tablet
   PCs in an online ERP on adolescent English learners' online activities,
   reading ability and users' perceptions. Two intact classes taught by a
   same English teacher in a senior high school in Taiwan were recruited to
   participate in a ten-week online ERP. One class was assigned to the
   mobile group reading their assignments on their tablet PCs and the
   other, the PC group, reading theirs on desktop PCs. During the online
   ERP, each class dedicated one class period every week for in-class
   reading and the participants in both classes were encouraged to read as
   many as possible after the class period. The results favored the mobile
   group who not only outperformed the PC group in online activities and
   reading achievement but also showed greater appreciation of the online
   ERP than their PC counterparts. The study also proposed two directions
   for future studies on mobile-assisted reading. They included learners'
   studying textbooks and their reading strategies on mobile devices. (C)

Title = {The effectiveness of a mobile application for the development of
   palpation and ultrasound imaging skills to supplement the traditional
   learning of physiotherapy students},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Volume = {16},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {Background: Mobile learning (m-learning) has becoming very popular in
   education due to the rapidly advancing technology in our society. The
   potentials of the mobile applications should be used to enhance the
   education process. Few mobile applications have been designed to
   complement the study of physical therapy skills for physiotherapy
   students. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a mobile
   application, as a supplement to traditional learning, is useful for
   physiotherapy students in the acquisition of palpation and ultrasound
   skills in the shoulder area.
   Methods: Forty-nine students participated in this single-blinded,
   randomized controlled study. They were randomly distributed into two
   groups: experimental, with free access to the mobile application; and
   control, with access to traditional learning materials on the topic.
   Objective structured clinical evaluation (OSCE) and multiple-choice
   questionnaire (MCQ) were used to assess the educational intervention.
   Then, we also assessed the time taken to get a reliable ultrasound image
   and to localize a specific shoulder structure by palpation.
   Results: There was no significant intergroup difference in the
   acquisition of theoretical knowledge (p =.089). Scores were
   significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group
   for the majority items in the ultrasound assessment; positioning of
   patient (p <.001), positioning of ultrasound probe (p = 0.007), handling
   of ultrasound probe (p =.013) and global OSCE (p <.001) and skills in
   palpation of the shoulder; position of patient (p =.009), direction of
   palpation contact (p =.021) and global OSCE (p =.034). There were no
   significant differences in the time required to perform the examination
   between groups in ultrasound (p =.944) and palpation (p =.393). The
   results from the post-program survey assessing the global satisfaction
   with the mobile application were high (8.200 +/-.767), on an 11 numeric
   point rating scale.
   Conclusion: These results suggest the effectiveness of an m-learning
   program as a complement to traditional education for developing skills
   in ultrasound and palpation of the shoulder region in undergraduate
   physiotherapy students.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Maastricht University has been actively exploring blended
   learning approaches to PBL in Health Master Programs. Key principles of
   PBL are, learning should be constructive, self-directed, collaborative,
   and contextual. The purpose is to explore whether these principles are
   applicable in blended learning.Methods: The programs, Master of Health
   Services Innovation (case 1), Master Programme in Global Health (case
   2), and the Master of Health Professions Education (case 3), used a
   Virtual Learning Environment for exchanging material and were
   independently analyzed. Quantitative data were collected for cases 1 and
   2. Simple descriptive analyses such as frequencies were performed.
   Qualitative data for cases 1 and 3 were collected via (focus group)
   interviews.Results: All PBL principles could be recognized in case 1.
   Case 2 seemed to be more project-based. In case 3, collaboration between
   students was not possible because of a difference in time-zones.
   Important educational aspects: agreement on rules for (online) sessions;
   visual contact (student-student and student-teacher), and frequent
   feedback.Conclusion: PBL in a blended learning format is perceived to be
   an effective strategy. The four principles of PBL can be unified in PBL
   with a blended learning format, although the extent to which each
   principle can be implemented can differ.},

Title = {A Hybrid Character Recognition Approach Using Fuzzy Logic and Stroke
   Bayesian Program Learning With Naive Bayes in Industrial Environments},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {124767-124782},
Abstract = {Automated character recognition is critical for reading and tracking
   data in a variety of fields. It is particularly challenging in
   industrial settings since information may be printed on the surface of
   various materials with complex and uneven shapes, causing overlapping,
   obstructing, and distorting characters. We propose a hybrid character
   recognition approach using fuzzy logic and stroke Bayesian program
   learning with naive Bayes. During character segmentation, touching
   characters are separated using support vector machines and a
   three-feature fuzzy segmentation strategy that uses particle swarm
   optimization. This approach includes a new methodology for stroke
   presentation and extraction using a prebuilt primitive-stroke library
   containing prior knowledge. During character recognition, a conceptual
   character model is constructed using stroke Bayesian program learning.
   Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling is used to produce a fitting model for
   each character. This model predicts character classification by
   calculating the probability that a target sample belongs to a training
   set. To this end, naive Bayes effectively discerns extremely similar
   characters. We evaluate our method experimentally using a database of
   industrial images and the NIST dataset. Our method outperforms existing
   state-of-the art methods.},

Abstract = {This study aims to identify Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge
   Model among engineering undergraduates students at the Afyon Kocatepe
   University. The main purpose of this research is to explain suitability
   of educational discipline knowledge model in terms of engineering
   education. This research which is in the quality of case identification
   is designed basing on quantitative research techniques. Likert scale is
   created which consist of forty nine sections which are suitable for
   quantitative researches by researcher. Also, there are five questions
   which define research group in the scale. Research group consist of
   Afyon Kocatepe University Engineering Faculty students. Three hundred
   and ninety eight students joined the research. Views of the students are
   registered with the help of scale and analyzed statistically. According
   to results found in research, activities of education and training in
   engineering faculty are suitable for Technological Pedagogical Content
   Knowledge Model. This study suggests that engineering undergraduate's
   education program need to focus on reinforcing the conceptual
   understanding, teaching strategies for specific topic and technological
   skill among undergraduate students of engineering education.},

Title = {When the school door closes, do teachers open a window? Using diary
   method to investigate teachers? online teaching practices and momentary
   experiences in crisis},

Abstract = {School closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic have had a major impact on
   teaching activities. Adopting a mixed-methods design, this study aims to
   categorize daily instructional practices in the early stages of school
   closure using two-cycle content analysis, present the transition of the
   categories over days, and test the differences between categories using
   ANOVA. A total of 48 high school teachers with varying levels of
   teaching readiness (measured by online professional development
   experience and distance teaching TPCK) kept teaching logs where they
   recorded daily teaching practices and assessed teaching satisfaction and
   perceived student engagement. They also submitted diary entries to
   report episodic optimal experience. Four salient emergency online
   teaching patterns emerged, which were further interpreted based on the
   Community of Inquiry framework (Garrison et al., 1999) as four presence
   orientations: 1) low social low cognitive, 2) low social high cognitive,
   3) high social low cognitive, and 4) high social high cognitive. Daily
   transition of these orientations revealed slight to medium changes.
   Teachers adopting different orientations were found to differ in terms
   of teaching readiness, teaching satisfaction, and perceived student
   engagement. No difference was shown in optimal experience. The results
   inform future professional development programs how to prepare high
   school teachers for the next emergency crisis.},

Title = {Faculty's experience in developing and implementing concept-based
   teaching of baccalaureate nursing education in the Chinese context: A
   descriptive qualitative research study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Background: Nursing education faces daunting challenges in preparing
   graduates to think critically in the context of the complex healthcare
   system of practice. Concept-based teaching (CBT) is an effective
   approach used in curriculum reform to cultivate critical thinking and
   active learning abilities in nursing students. Objectives: This research
   aims to investigate faculty's experiences while developing and
   implementing CBT, and clarify barriers to and facilitators of CBT reform
   in China. Design: A descriptive qualitative study. Setting: A university
   in middle China. Participants: Full-time teachers teaching in a
   four-year undergraduate nursing program that offers CBT. Methods: This
   study used a purposive sampling method and collected data through
   semi-structured interviews. The researchers digitally recorded and
   transcribed each interview verbatim. The conventional content analysis
   method was used to examine the faculty's experiences while developing
   and implementing CBT. Theoretical saturation was achieved using ten
   educators due to the group's high homogeneity. Results: Through the data
   analysis process, five themes emerged from the participants'
   descriptions: questioning themselves, taking responsibility, struggling
   with conflict and stress, recognizing support, and feeling worthwhile.
   Thirteen subthemes were also identified. The overarching themes
   extracted from the participants' experiences were struggling with
   conflict and stress and feeling worthwhile. Conclusion: The faculty's
   CBT experiences ranged from curiosity and expectation at the initial
   stage to confusion in the face of challenges at the middle stage. The
   faculty ultimately believed that their time and energy were
   well-invested. Faculty faced significant challenges due to students'
   resistance, peer maladjustment, and inner conflict during the reform
   process, but the administrators supported their transition and helped
   them overcome difficulties through change theory-based workshop
   training. Developing effective strategies was indispensable to reduce
   both faculty's and students' resistance and negative reactions.},

Abstract = {The Federal University of SAo Paulo, Baixada Santista Campus was founded
   in 2006 with five degree-granting programs in physical education,
   physiotherapy, nutrition, psychology, and occupational therapy. The
   guiding principle behind the programs' educational mission was centered
   on the development of health care professionals capable of working in
   interdisciplinary teams with an emphasis on holistic patient care. This
   pedagogical structure required peer-mentoring programs in order to
   integrate different areas of knowledge and to improve learning
   strategies among new generations of students. The authors' objective in
   the present report is to discuss the strategies and activities of the
   peer-mentoring program in histophysiology and gross anatomy in an
   interdisciplinary and interprofessional curriculum. Evaluations by
   students, mentors and professors are presented, along with a statistical
   analysis of variance comparing student performance in the module
   assessments according to their participation in the peer-mentoring
   activities. The results demonstrated that students who participated in
   peer-mentoring activities enjoyed a higher rate of academic success than
   those who did not participate. In addition, student and mentor
   evaluations of the peer mentoring program were highly positive. The
   program enabled mentors to gain a deeper knowledge of the subjects
   addressed in the learning modules, as well as to develop intrinsic
   teaching skills during their time as mentors. In short, the authors
   believe that the peer-mentoring program has been validated for its
   effectiveness in raising student academic performance. Anat Sci Educ 8:

Abstract = {Background Although person-centered care (PCC) ensures high-quality care
   for patients, studies have shown that it is unevenly applied in clinical
   practice. The extent to which future health care providers are currently
   offered education in PCC at their universities is unclear. We aimed to
   clarify the PCC content offered to students as a basis for their
   understanding by exploring the PCC content of Swedish national study
   programs in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, and physiotherapy.
   Methods Using a qualitative document analysis design, we sampled the
   steering documents from all higher education institutions (n = 48) with
   accreditation in medicine (n = 7), nursing (n = 25), occupational
   therapy (n = 8), or physiotherapy (n = 8) at a single time point. All
   national study programs (n = 4), local program syllabuses (n = 48), and
   local course syllabuses (n = 799) were reviewed using a 10-item
   protocol. Results We found no content related to PCC in the steering
   documents at the national level. At the local level, however, signs of
   PCC were identified in local program syllabuses and local course
   syllabuses. Seven of the 48 local program syllabuses (15\%) included PCC
   in their intended learning outcomes. Eight of the 799 local course
   syllabuses (1\%) contained course titles that included the phrase
   `person-centered care,' and another 101 listed 142 intended learning
   outcomes referring to PCC. A total of 21 terms connected to PCC were
   found, and the term `person-centered care' was most commonly used in the
   nursing programs and least commonly in the medical programs. Conclusions
   There is a broad range in how the national study programs in Sweden have
   incorporated PCC. The implementation has been driven by a bottom-up
   strategy. A deliberate and standardized strategy is needed to ensure
   full implementation of PCC into clinical curricula in higher education.},

Abstract = {Contribution: This paper examined student effort and performance in an
   introductory programming course with respect to student-held implicit
   theories and self-efficacy.
   Background: Implicit theories and self-efficacy help in understanding
   academic success, which must be considered when developing effective
   learning strategies for programming.
   Research Questions: Are implicit theories of intelligence and
   programming, and programming-efficacy, related to each other and to
   student success in programming? Is it possible to predict student
   performance in a course using these constructs?
   Methodology: Two consecutive surveys (N = 100 and N = 81) were
   administered to non-CS engineering students in Isik University, Turkey.
   Findings: Implicit theories of programming-aptitude and
   programming-efficacy are interrelated and positively correlated with
   effort, performance, and previous failures in the course. Although it
   was not possible to predict student course grade the data confirms that
   students who believe in improvable programming aptitude have
   significantly higher programming efficacy, report more effort, and get
   higher course grades. In addition, failed students tend to associate the
   failure with fixed programming aptitude; repeating students favor fixed
   programming aptitude theory and have lower programming-efficacy, which
   increases the possibility of further failure.},

Title = {Teaching health science students foundation motivational interviewing
   skills: use of motivational interviewing treatment integrity and
   self-reflection to approach transformative learning},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},

Abstract = {Background: Many undergraduate and graduate-entry health science
   curricula have incorporated training in motivational interviewing (MI).
   However, to effectively teach skills that will remain with students
   after they graduate is challenging. The aims of this study were to find
   out self-assessed MI skills of health students and whether reflecting on
   the results can promote transformative learning.
   Methods: Thirty-six Australian occupational therapy and physiotherapy
   students were taught the principles of MI, asked to conduct a
   motivational interview, transcribe it, self-rate it using the
   Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) tool and reflect on
   the experience. Student MI skills were measured using the reported MITI
   subscores. Student assignments and a focus group discussion were
   analysed to explore the student experience using the MITI tool and
   self-reflection to improve their understanding of MI principles.
   Results: Students found MI challenging, although identified the MITI
   tool as useful for promoting self-reflection and to isolate MI skills.
   Students self-assessed their MI skills as competent and higher than
   scores expected from beginners.
   Conclusions: The results inform educational programs on how MI skills
   can be developed for health professional students and can result in
   transformative learning. Students may over-state their MI skills and
   strategies to reduce this, including peer review, are discussed.
   Structured self-reflection, using tools such as the MITI can promote
   awareness of MI skills and compliment didactic teaching methods.},

Title = {Undergraduate nursing students' learning experiences of a telehealth
   clinical practice program during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative
   study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {111},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, nurse
   education institutions are required to create innovative and diverse
   educational methods to ensure the continued learning of undergraduate
   nursing students. We developed a telehealth clinical practice program to
   address this challenge.
   Objectives: We explored the students' learning experiences of our
   telehealth clinical practice program by qualitatively analyzing student
   reports.
   Methods: The participants were fourth-year undergraduate students who
   had taken the telehealth clinical practice program at Hiroshima
   University. Data were collected as reports from the participants during
   clinical practice and analyzed using thematic analysis.
   Results: Of the 59 students who completed the practical training, 26
   agreed to participate in the study (consent rate: 44.1\%). Sixteen
   themes emerged from the analysis as the students' learning experiences,
   and were classified into four thematic categories: (1) recognition of
   continued self-improvement required to become a nurse and development of
   a sense of ethics, (2) improvement of knowledge and practical skills in
   chronic care nursing, (3) acquisition of telehealth skills, and (4)
   learning through modeling and teamwork, and improvement of
   self-efficacy. Interacting with persons through telehealth provided an
   opportunity to learn directly about persons' lives and their experiences
   of illness, and helped participants develop a sense of responsibility
   and ethical nursing.
   Conclusions: Our study findings indicate that undergraduate nursing
   students perceived that their attitude, knowledge and skill acquisition
   improved through this program. We believe that telehealth can have a
   place as a teaching strategy and this telehealth clinical practice
   program can be further enhanced the learning effects by combining it
   with face-to-face training and multidisciplinary education in the
   future.},

Title = {Learning fuzzy measures from data: Simplifications and optimisation
   strategies},
Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {494},
Pages = {100-113},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Fuzzy measures model interactions between the inputs in aggregation
   problems. Their complexity grows exponentially with the dimensionality
   of the problem, and elicitation of fuzzy measure coefficients either
   from domain experts or from empirical data is a significant challenge.
   The notions of k-additivity and k-maxitivity simplify the fuzzy measures
   by limiting interactions to subsets of up to k elements, but neither
   reduces the complexity of monotonicity constraints. In this paper we
   explore various approaches to further reduce the complexity of learning
   fuzzy measures. We introduce the concept of k-interactivity, which
   reduces both the number of variables and constraints, and also the
   complexity of each constraint. The learning problem is set as a linear
   programming problem, and its numerical efficiency is illustrated on
   numerical experiments. The proposed methods allow efficient learning of
   fuzzy measures in up to 30 variables, which is significantly higher than
   using k-additive and k-maxitive fuzzy measures. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {With the mounting empirical evidence of the benefits of mindfulness, the
   researchers of the present study incorporated mindful learning in
   digital game-based learning of creativity. A two-phase study was
   conducted to (1) develop the Inventory of Mindful Learning Experience in
   Digital Games (IMLE-DG); and (2) develop a training program of the
   Digital Game-based Learning of Creativity (DGLC), by which the
   relationship among achievement goal, self-determination, mindful
   learning, and mastery experience during digital game-based learning of
   creativity were investigated through experimental instruction. One
   hundred and eighty-one 3rd to 6th graders were used in the development
   of IMLE-DG, and 95 3rd and 4th graders were included in the six-week
   experimental instruction through the DGLC. The results suggest that the
   IMLE-DG has good reliability and validity. The Cronbach's a coefficient
   was 0.974 and exploratory factor analysis yielded three factors:
   curiosity and open-mindedness, attention and grit, and emotion
   regulation. Confirmatory factor analysis also showed that the
   three-factor structure was a good-fit model (Goodness-fit-index =
   0.913). Moreover, analytical results showed that achievement goal and
   self-determination influenced mastery experience through mindful
   learning experience, suggesting that mindful learning is a crucial
   mediator of mastery experience in digital game-based learning of
   creativity. With key features of story-based, interdisciplinary, and 3-D
   design, The DGLC provides an original and valuable vehicle for
   creativity learning. In addition, the incorporated mechanisms (rewards,
   free choices, immediate feedback, and peer-evaluation) for enhancing
   goal achievement, self-determination, and mindful learning shed light on
   the design of game-based learning and creativity instruction.},

Title = {An anatomy workshop for improving anatomy self-efficacy and competency

Abstract = {First-year Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) students entering a
   problem-based learning (PBL) program are faced with a number of
   pedagogical challenges, including the development of self-directed
   learning skills, resource unfamiliarity, and group dynamics. These
   challenges can make learning anatomy in a self-directed manner less
   efficient. Prematriculation introduction of strategies to improve
   anatomy learning may help prepare students for a rigorous DPT program
   and improve anatomy learning efficiency. The present study describes a
   2-day anatomy workshop offered to incoming students before a 1)n program
   was initiated. Knowledge acquired during both days of the workshop
   resulted in statistically significant improvements in anatomy postquiz
   scores for each corresponding prequiz (P < 0.001 for lower and upper
   limb quizzes). Workshop participants survey responses demonstrated that
   anatomy confidence and NI, preparedness increased at distinct intervals
   following the workshop and was significantly higher than controls after
   the first semester (P < 0.01 for anatomy confidence and PBL
   preparedness). Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated
   statistically significant relationships between semester anatomy
   practical scores and workshop participation (P = 0.03 for practical 1
   and P = 0.049 for practical 2) and undergraduate grade point average (P
   < 0.001 for practical 1 and P = 0.03 for practical 2). First-year DPT
   students reported the anatomy workshop to be a valuable experience for
   learning strategies to improve anatomy self-efficacy. An introductory
   anatomy workshop is an effective strategy to improve self-directed
   anatomy learning efficiency before the start of a rigorous DPT program.},

Title = {Measuring medical students' reflection on their learning: modification
   and validation of the motivated strategies for learning questionnaire
   (MSLQ)},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {NOV 22},
Abstract = {BackgroundReflection on learning is an essential component of effective
   learning. Deconstructing the components of reflection on learning using
   a self-regulated learning (SRL) framework, allows the assessment of
   students' ability to reflect on their learning. The aim of this study
   was to validate an instrument to measure medical students' reflection on
   their learning.MethodsA systematic search was conducted to identify the
   most suitable instrument to measure students' reflection on their
   learning based on the theoretical framework of SRL. The search
   identified the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ)
   which contained five subscales: internal goal orientation,
   self-efficacy, critical thinking, metacognitive/self-regulation, help
   seeking and peer learning. Using the original MSLQ as the foundation, we
   carried out three phases of a research program to develop a useful set
   of items: an expert panel's review of items, a substantial pilot study,
   and a factor analysis of ratings of a modified set of items by
   preclinical and final year medical students.ResultsThe factor analysis
   of the Modified MSLQ extracted four subscales with reasonable internal
   consistency: self-orientation, critical thinking, self-regulation and
   feedback-seeking. Each subscale correlates highly with the Modified MSLQ
   score, with modest inter-correlations between the subscales suggesting
   that they are measuring different components of the total
   score.ConclusionMedical students and their educators need to be able to
   monitor their learning in their complex academic and clinical
   environments. The Modified MSLQ provides a means of investigating and
   tracking individual medical students' reflections on their learning.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Physical education teacher education programs prepare
   preservice teachers to lead Comprehensive School Physical Activity
   Programs. Through the coordination of a university's physical education
   teacher education program and an elementary school, the purpose of this
   study was to examine preservice and in-service teachers' perspectives in
   implementing a 6-week movement integration program. Method: A total of
   12 preservice teachers participated in a weekly online discussion forum
   as part of a community of practice. In addition, the preservice teachers
   and three in-service teachers participated in an interview. Data were
   analyzed for themes. Results: The themes were facilitating
   implementation through support, sharing ideas for common practice, and
   overcoming challenges in implementation. Support received by the
   preservice teachers facilitated the implementation of the program. They
   also shared strategies to overcome implementation challenges through the
   weekly online discussions. Discussion/Conclusion: Fostering communities
   of practice among preservice teachers prepares them for collaboration
   and movement integration implementation in the future.},

Abstract = {There is a growing demand in the US for more engineers, yet attrition
   rates from university engineering programs are high and diversity in
   engineering is low. Few resources have been dedicated to the improvement
   of freshman engineering courses even though freshman students have the
   highest rates of attrition. Through a synthesis of the literature on
   inclusive instructional strategies and participant structures in
   educational settings, we developed, implemented, and researched a
   freshman mechanical engineering design course that incorporated elements
   of project-based learning, collaboration, service-learning, and
   customer-oriented design through a partnership with a local elementary
   school. Our research was grounded in the value and competence belief
   constructs defined by expectancy-value theory. Engineering values
   include enjoying engineering tasks, viewing engineering as useful, and
   identifying as an engineer and engineering competence beliefs encompass
   beliefs in one's engineering abilities in the present, as well
   expectancies for success in the future. Rich qualitative data collected
   from 72 undergraduate participants suggested that this course was both
   highly valued and helpful for increasing engineering competence beliefs.
   Further, these positive impacts were consistent across gender. From our
   results, we provide recommendations for strategies to help grow and
   diversify engineering.},

Title = {A strategy transfer approach for intelligent human-robot collaborative
   assembly},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {168},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In small batch and customized production, human-robot collaborative
   assembly (HRCA) is an important method to deal with the production
   demand of new-energy vehicles, which have the characteristics of rapid
   change and growth of personal needs. However, due to the difficulty of
   reusing historical assembly knowledge, it can not be used to effectively
   guide new tasks. Aiming at the transfer problem of collaborative
   strategy, this paper first defines the robot participating in the
   cooperation as an agent with reinforcement learning (RL) and proposes a
   framework of HRCA based on transfer learning (TL-HRCA). It consists of
   three modules: HRCA strategy generation, similarity evaluation, and
   strategy transfer for realizing rapid design and verification of product
   assembly strategy. The strategy generation module aims to establish an
   intelligent mapping from task to collaboration strategy based on part
   features. Based on the evaluation of task similarity, the mobility
   evaluation model divides subtasks into similar and dissimilar
   categories. For similar subtasks, the adversarial discriminative domain
   adaption is constructed to quickly design the HRCA strategy in the
   target domain. However, for dissimilar subtasks, the RL agent is trained
   continuously to obtain a new HRCA strategy. Finally, an assembly case
   study of power lithium batteries is conducted, of which the results have
   shown that TL-HRCA can improve the assembly efficiency by 25.846\%
   compared to the traditional pre-programming assembly.},

Title = {Simulation strategies to increase nursing student clinical competence in
   safe medication administration practices: A quasi-experimental study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {96},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: Nursing student medication errors often result from deficits
   in knowledge and application of fundamental safe administration
   practices. Factors such as high faculty-student ratios and legal
   restrictions have decreased clinical learning opportunities for nursing
   students to practice safe medication administration in the clinical
   setting. Evidence suggests that use of a structured medication safety
   enhancement (MSE) simulation program can significantly improve student
   knowledge and competency in safe medication administration.
   Purpose: To examine the effects of an educational strategy using a MSE
   simulation program with integrated technology on the medication
   administration knowledge, competency, and confidence levels of
   undergraduate nursing students.
   Methods: This quasi-experimental replication study designed and
   implemented medication simulations enhanced by integrated information
   technologies in an undergraduate-nursing curriculum. Third-year BSN
   students (n = 83) were randomized into intervention or control groups.
   Control groups participated in standard training while the intervention
   group received additional clinical simulation experience and debriefing
   sessions focused on medication safety practices. Participant knowledge
   was measured using pre/post Medication Safety Knowledge Assessment
   (MSKA) and competency was evaluated using the Medication Safety Critical
   Element Checklist (MSCEC).
   Results: The MSKA and MSCEC were analyzed using two-sided independent
   t-tests. Post-test knowledge scores increased in both groups but results
   were not statistically significant (alpha = 0. 05). Students who
   received the medication safetfy enhancement intervention performed
   significantly better in a subsequent simulation than students who did
   not have prior simulation experience (p < .001).
   Conclusion: Findings suggest that educators should consider high
   fidelity simulation as an evidence-based teaching strategy to engage
   students in understanding and implementing medication safety practices
   in the clinical setting.},

Title = {Exploiting Arduino Features to Develop Programming Competencies},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {20602-20615},
Abstract = {Developing programming competencies is essential for systems,
   information science, computer science, and electrical engineering
   students. Engineering students usually face the complexity of working
   with programming languages that demand compliance with syntactic and
   semantic rules, which typically represent a daunting task for novice
   students. Watching textual messages on the screen only, like the classic
   ``hello world,{''} is no longer attractive in the current information
   society, a missing motivation and possible obstacle to developing
   programming competencies. Students would like to interact with hardware
   and appreciate environmental reactions. Arduino board permits developing
   solutions like that. This article presents the academic experience of
   first-year students of Ingenieria de Sistemas e Informatica at the
   Universidad Continental (ISI-UC) of Huancayo, Peru, using the Arduino
   microcontroller board for the teaching-learning process to develop
   programming competencies. The results obtained show a positive impact
   regarding the experience of previous using traditional text-based
   programming languages. Using Arduino, students create digital circuits
   and computational electronics competencies, another significant benefit.
   This experience used an online simulator, and the results obtained
   permit us to plan future online education strategies for this major. The
   next step will be the application of Arduino and the online simulator to
   deepen programming skills, including recursivity, real-time constraints,
   multitasking features, data structure, data-oriented programming, and
   object-oriented programming. The primary limitations encountered in this
   experiment were the students' lack of experience with electronics
   concepts to build circuits and, in some cases, the low internet speeds
   to assist in the programming process of online education. Realizing
   simulated experiences in classroom experiences was not a significant
   challenge for teachers and most students. However, problems could arise
   when students perform practical experiences using real Arduino boards in
   traditional classes for the availability requirement of Arduino and
   other electronic components.},

Title = {Improving the communication skills of medical students --A survey of
   simulated patient-based learning in Chinese medical universities},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 13},
Abstract = {Background It is useful to advance simulated patient (SP) participation
   in teaching to improve the communication skills of medical students, so
   this study aims to explore the current state of Chinese mainland SP
   education. Methods A cross sectional survey was designed utilizing well
   defined quantitative research methods and descriptive statistics. The
   questionnaire sought information which elucidated the current status of
   SP-based education, the origin of SP-based learning, SP training,
   challenges of this learning strategy and future developments.
   Questionnaires were distributed to 79 medical colleges in mainland
   China, and 68 were returned. Of these, 64 constituted valid responses
   (81\%). Results The number of SP-based education activities in medical
   colleges offering 5-year?7-year and 8-year clinical medicine programs
   was significantly higher than that in medical colleges which offered
   only a single 5-year program (p < 0.01). Communication skills training
   accounted for 73\% of the content of SP-based learning activities, and
   was expected to rise in the future to 90\%, in response to a need to
   improve doctor-patient relationships. Persons recruited as `simulated
   patients' included students (21\% of the total), residents (49\%),
   medical staff (15\%) and teaching staff (14\%). Colleges, planning a
   SP-based education program, preferred teachers (80\%) and students
   (55\%) to assume `simulated patient' roles. In objective structured
   clinical education (OSCE) scenarios, co-scoring by both SPs and teachers
   featured more highly in the `consultation' station and `doctor-patient
   communication' station. A number of factors were identified as hindering
   future development and implementation of SP-based learning including
   budget restraints, SP selection and training. Conclusions SP-based
   learning programs offer clear benefits for improving the clinical
   education of medical students and their communication skills. The main
   obstacles to achieving more widespread and higher quality SP-based
   education are insufficient funding and the lack of standardized training
   and performance evaluation processes for simulated patients. Medical
   colleges should consider reducing the proportion of students and
   teachers acting as SPs, and attract more citizens to participate in
   SP-based learning activities. Formalised training and evaluation of SPs
   performance are necessary to establish a `standard simulated patient'
   for a particular medical discipline, thus improving SP-based activities
   and student learning.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we explore how to apply Problem-Based Learning (PBL) to
   enrich the design of interdisciplinary education programs and facilitate
   the integration of big data engineering education into business
   contexts. Theoretically, we take social constructivism as the
   theoretical root of PBL, which highlights principles of student-centered
   learning, active learning, learning by doing, group learning, teachers'
   facilitation of the learning process, etc. In designing an education
   program, it is necessary to align diverse elements of PBL, including (1)
   objectives and outcomes; (2) types of problems, projects, and lectures;
   (3) progression, size, and duration; (4) students' learning; (5)
   academic staff and facilitation; (6) space and organization; and (7)
   assessment and evaluation. This leads to a discussion of a case on
   developing a new Bachelor of Education program of ``Big Data + Business
   Administration{''} at Northeastern University (NEU), China. The case
   shows how PBL is applied in practice for the development of
   interdisciplinary engineering education and reflects how NEU managed
   institutional and cultural challenges in the process of changes. This
   paper provides implications for better developing interdisciplinary
   engineering education in the future.},

Abstract = {A World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Veterinary Education
   Twinning Project was established between the veterinary schools at Nong
   Lam University (NLU) in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and the University of
   Queensland, Gatton, Australia, as part of the scheme established to
   promote high-quality veterinary services through improved veterinary
   education. Included in the partnership's primary aims were building the
   capacity of veterinary teaching staff with respect to general teaching
   practice and also in response to identified deficiency areas, and to
   develop outcome assessment processes. One challenge facing the project
   was the different approaches and experiences of teaching and learning
   for the faculty and students between the two widely different historical
   and cultural contexts of Australia and Vietnam. The project enhanced the
   pedagogy capability in NLU faculty and introduced student-focused
   approaches to teaching. The NLU staff involved in the project strongly
   embraced a student-centered approach to learning and case-based teaching
   in particular, adopting these strategies in their own teaching. An
   analysis of students' approach to learning demonstrates that the
   majority preferred a deep approach to learning and that these students
   valued case studies, problem-solving exercises, and working in small
   groups during teaching sessions more than students who took a surface
   approach to learning. An improved recognition of the ways the Vietnamese
   students approach their learning in their home country will guide future
   teaching design, as well as give insight into the approaches to teaching
   for Southeast Asian students within the Australian veterinary science
   programs.},

Abstract = {A data-driven approximation formulation for the state reconstruction
   problem of dynamical systems is presented in this paper. Without the
   assumption of an explicit mathematical model, the
   Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) based approach of a data-driven state
   reconstruction design method for monitoring and output-feedback control
   of dynamical systems is presented. The proposed state reconstruction
   design is based on a dynamic programming approach. To evaluate the
   proposed state reconstruction, computational experiments are conducted
   using only dynamical system model output data. The sensitivity of the
   algorithm parameters is also analyzed and discussed. The performance
   evaluation is analyzed in terms of the error metrics of the discrete
   linear quadratic regulator with output feedback under the value
   iteration algorithm through a reinforcement learning strategy.},

Abstract = {Educational process mining is now a promising method to provide
   decision-support information for the teaching-learning process via
   finding useful educational guidance from the event logs recorded in the
   learning management system. Existing studies mainly focus on mining
   students' problem-solving skills or behavior patterns and intervening in
   students' learning processes according to this information in the late
   course. However, educators often expect to improve the learning outcome
   in a proactive manner through dynamically designing instructional
   strategies prior to a course that are more appropriate to students'
   average ability. Therefore, in this article, we propose a two-stage
   problem-solving ability modeling approach to obtain students' ability in
   different learning stages, including the pre-problem-solving ability
   model and the post-problem-solving ability model. The models are trained
   with Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) on the historical event logs
   of the prerequisite course and the target course, respectively. With the
   premodel, we establish the students' pre-problem-solving ability
   profiles that reflect their average knowledge level before starting a
   course. Then, the instructional design is dynamically chosen according
   to the profiles. After a course completes, the post-problem-solving
   ability profiles are generated by the postmodel to analyze the learning
   outcome and prompt the learning feedback, in order to complete the
   closed-loop teaching process. We study the modeling of coding ability in
   computer programming education to show our teaching strategy. The
   experimental results show that the generalizable problem-solving ability
   models yield high classification precision, while most students'
   abilities have been significantly improved by the proposed approach at
   the end of the course.},

Abstract = {Mobile games can foster the early mathematics skills of children in
   poverty at home. This ran-domized controlled trial examines the efficacy
   of Escribo Play, an evidence-based, game-enhanced early mathematics
   program with an initial pool of 2980 first-grade students from 267
   classrooms in 132 schools located in Brazil. The intervention reached
   47\% of the children who installed and used the application. Students
   from 56 classrooms (20\%) did not use the application. The intervention
   retained 51\% of those who installed the application. Children of the
   experi-mental group who played Escribo Play advanced 2.27 times more
   than the increase of the control group for number identification, 2.78
   times more in count-sequence, 1.73 times more in geo-metric shape, and
   1.41 times more in spatial sense. The overall reduction in disparities
   between participants from pretest to posttest of the experimental group
   was 9.1 times higher than the control group, indicating that the
   intervention reduced learning inequality for those that played the
   games. The higher gains observed among those children who used Escribo
   Play may be attributed to its interactive nature, employing
   evidence-based instructional strategies with engaging and interactive
   content (i.e., animation and games). The cost per pupil is much lower
   than reported in 90\% of other educational interventions. The
   application is easy to scale and provides learning gains for first-grade
   students.},

Abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) can be considered a 21st century core skill
   and, accordingly, it should be taught to students at an early age.
   Nevertheless, the implementation of CT in school curricula is still in
   an experimental stage, given that different performance metrics remain
   unclear, including the appropriate age for learning each skill, the
   significant and achievable computational concepts for each school year,
   teaching strategies, learning effectiveness, and strategies for
   assessing development. Based upon constructivist problem-solving
   learning strategies and supported by a three-dimensional framework, a
   game-based environment with both individual and collaborative playing
   modes has been developed as a learning and an assessment tool via
   learning analytics. Moreover, an exploratory case study has been carried
   out involving 176 primary school students. Results suggest that this
   environment is suitable as a learning and assessment tool for CT skills
   in primary school, providing enduring learning, particularly when it
   engages the collaborative playing mode. It seems to be better adapted to
   early primary school stage students, who showed greater improvements and
   who were able to assimilate more computational concepts than expected.
   Likewise, special needs or low percentile students benefit even more
   greatly from the learning tool and especially from the collaborative
   playing mode. The combination of different assessment
   methodologies-including CT pre- and posttests, data-driven analytics,
   direct observation, and questionnaires-provides assessment for each of
   the framework computational dimensions.},

Abstract = {As the data becomes bigger and more complex, people tend to process it
   in a distributed system implemented on clusters. Due to the power
   consumption, cost, and differentiated price-performance, the clusters
   are evolving into the system with heterogeneous hardware leading to the
   performance difference among the nodes. Even in a homogeneous cluster,
   the performance of the nodes is different due to the resource
   competition and the communication cost. Some nodes with poor performance
   will drag down the efficiency of the whole system. Existing parallel
   computing strategies such as bulk synchronous parallel strategy and
   stale synchronous parallel strategy are not well suited to this problem.
   To address it, we proposed a free stale synchronous parallel (FSSP)
   strategy to free the system from the negative impact of those nodes.
   FSSP is improved from stale synchronous parallel (SSP) strategy, which
   can effectively and accurately figure out the slow nodes and eliminate
   the negative effects of those nodes. We validated the performance of the
   FSSP strategy by using some classical machine learning algorithms and
   datasets. Our experimental results demonstrated that FSSP was 1.5-12x
   faster than the bulk synchronous parallel strategy and stale synchronous
   parallel strategy, and it used 4x fewer iterations than the asynchronous
   parallel strategy to converge.},

Abstract = {Multiclass classification is one of the most fundamental tasks in data
   mining. However, traditional data mining methods rely on the model
   assumption, they generally can suffer from the overfitting problem on
   high dimension and low sample size (HDLSS) data. Trying to address
   multiclass classification problems on HDLSS data from another
   perspective, we utilize Genetic Programming (GP), an intrinsic
   evolutionary classification algorithm that can implement feature
   construction automatically without model assumption. This article
   develops an ensemble-based genetic programming classification framework,
   the Sigmoid-based Ensemble Gene Expression Programming (SE-GEP). To
   relieve the problem of output conflict in GP-based multiclass
   classifiers, the proposed method employs a flexible probability
   representation with continuous relaxation to better integrate the output
   of all the binary classifiers, an effective data division strategy to
   further enhance the ensemble performance, and a novel sampling strategy
   to refine the existing GP-based binary classifier. The experiment
   results indicate that SE-GEP can attain better classification accuracy
   compared to other GP methods. Moreover, the comparison with other
   representative machine learning methods indicates that SE-GEP is a
   competitive method for multiclass classification in HDLSS data.},

Title = {Effectiveness of a self-directed learning program using blended coaching
   among nursing students in clinical practice: a quasi-experimental
   research design},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {JUN 24},
Abstract = {BackgroundNew educational approaches may be necessary to enhance
   competency in the new generation of students. Self-directed learning and
   blended coaching have been effective strategies to meet this challenge.
   However, there has been little research on self-directed learning
   programs using blended coaching (SDL\_BC) in clinical practice. This
   study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-directed learning
   program using blended coaching among nursing students in clinical
   practice.MethodsA non-equivalent control group pretest-posttest
   non-synchronized intervention design was used. The participants were 91
   students, comprising an experimental group (n=44) and a control group
   (n=47). The experimental group was trained using a self-directed
   learning program with blended coaching. The Self-Directed Learning
   Competency Questionnaire, Clinical Competency Questionnaire, and Numeric
   Rating Score for clinical practice satisfaction via a self-report were
   all used in the assessment. Descriptive statistics, independent t-tests
   and ANCOVA were used to evaluate self-directed learning competency,
   clinical competency, and clinical practice satisfaction.ResultsStudents
   in the experimental group showed a significantly higher improvement in
   competency in the implementation of self-directed learning (F
   (1,89)=4.27, p=0.039) and higher satisfaction with clinical practice (t
   (89)=3.10, p=0.003) compared with those in the control
   group.ConclusionsThese results provide evidence that a self-directed
   learning program using blended coaching is an effective educational
   approach to improve the implementation part of self-directed learning
   competency and clinical practice satisfaction among nursing students in
   clinical practice. Further research is required to investigate whether
   other variables are associated with clinical competency, competency in
   planning and evaluation of self-directed learning, or their long-term
   effects.},

Abstract = {Probabilistic inductive logic programming (PILP) is a statistical
   relational learning technique which extends inductive logic programming
   by considering probabilistic data. The ability to use probabilities to
   represent uncertainty comes at the cost of an exponential evaluation
   time when composing theories to model the given problem. For this
   reason, PILP systems rely on various pruning strategies in order to
   reduce the search space. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge,
   there has been no systematic analysis of the different pruning
   strategies, how they impact the search space and how they interact with
   one another. This work presents a unified representation for PILP
   pruning strategies which enables end-users to understand how these
   strategies work both individually and combined and to make an informed
   decision on which pruning strategies to select so as to best achieve
   their goals. The performance of pruning strategies is evaluated both
   time and quality-wise in two state-of-the-art PILP systems with datasets
   from three different domains. Besides analysing the performance of the
   pruning strategies, we also illustrate the utility of PILP in one of the
   application domains, which is a real-world application.},

Abstract = {Existing tools aimto detect university studentswith early diagnosis of
   dyslexia or reading difficulties, but there are not developed tools that
   let those students better understand some aspects of their difficulties.
   In this paper, a dashboard for visualizing and inspecting early detected
   reading difficulties and their characteristics, called PADA (acronymfor
   the Spanish name Panel de Analiticas de Aprendizaje deDislexia en
   Adultos), is presented. PADA is a web-based tool designed to facilitate
   the creation of descriptive visualizations required for a better
   understanding by students about their learnermodel. Through information
   visualization techniques, PADA shows students the knowledge in their
   learner models in order to help themto increase their awareness and to
   support reflection and self-regulation about their difficulties in
   reading. PADA provides different learning analytics on reading
   performance of students, so that they can self-identify their strengths
   and weaknesses and self-regulate their learning. This paper describes
   examples that cover a variety of visualizations (bar-charts,
   line-charts, and pie-charts) to show user model fragments as personal
   details, reading profiles, learning styles, and cognitive traits of the
   students. We tested PADA with 26 students (aged 21-53 years) of
   different academic programs and levels, dyslexic and non-dyslexic. The
   results show that PADA can assist students in creating awareness, and
   help themto understand their difficulties associated with the reading
   tasks, aswell as facilitate reflection and self-regulation in the
   learning process. Implications for the design of learning analytics are
   discussed and directions for future work are outlined.},

Title = {Final-Year Veterinary Students' Perceptions of Their Communication
   Competencies and a Communication Skills Training Program Delivered in a
   Primary Care Setting and Based on Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Veterinary graduates require effective communication skills training to
   successfully transition from university into practice. Although the
   literature has supported the need for veterinary student communication
   skills training programs, there is minimal research using learning
   theory to design programs and explore students' perceptions of such
   programs. This study investigated veterinary students' perceptions of
   (1) their communication skills and (2) the usefulness of a communication
   skills training program designed with Kolb's Experiential Learning
   Theory (ELT) as a framework and implemented in a primary care setting.
   Twenty-nine final-year veterinary students from the Ontario Veterinary
   College attended a 3-week communication skills training rotation. Pre-
   and post-training surveys explored their communication objectives,
   confidence in their communication skills, and the usefulness of specific
   communication training strategies. The results indicated that both
   before and after training, students were most confident in building
   rapport, displaying empathy, recognizing how bonded a client is with his
   or her pet, and listening. They were least confident in managing clients
   who were angry or not happy with the charges and who monopolized the
   appointment. Emotionally laden topics, such as breaking bad news and
   managing euthanasia discussions, were also identified as challenging and
   in need of improvement. Interactive small-group discussions and review
   of video-recorded authentic client appointments were most valuable for
   their learning and informed students' self-awareness of their non-verbal
   communication. These findings support the use of Kolb's ELT as a
   theoretical framework and of video review and reflection to guide
   veterinary students' learning of communication skills in a primary care
   setting.},

Abstract = {This paper provides details of a study in which multimedia Learning
   Objects (LOs) have been designed and built for the field of Graphic
   Expression and then have been used by 54 students into the subject
   Graphic Expression Applied to Building Design of Building Engineering
   Program as a teaching aid for the purpose of analysing the affect of
   motivation on students' approaches to learning following LO use. They
   were used the instrument ``Motivated Strategies for Learning
   Questionnaire (MSLQ){''} for measuring motivation and the ``Revised
   Two-Factor Study Process Questionnaire (R-SPQ-2F){''} was used to
   measure the approaches to learning, Findings show that following the use
   of LOs in Graphic expression motivation is linked to approaches to
   learning, independently of their intensity, producing a significant
   difference between the variables for Approaches to Learning and the
   variables for Motivation that correspond to Intrinsic Goal Orientation,
   Task Value, and Control of Learning Beliefs.},

Abstract = {AimThis study aimed to evaluate the effect of a digital learning tool on
   undergraduate dental students' performance in detecting dental caries
   using ICDAS.
   MethodsAn experimental digital learning tool (DLT) was created using
   digital photographs of sound and carious teeth. Thirty-nine students
   were divided into three groups (n=13) and each assessed 12 randomly
   allocated patients before and after learning strategies: G1, ICDAS
   e-learning program; G2, ICDAS e-learning program plus DLT; G3, no
   learning strategy. Students (n=32) reassessed patients 2weeks after
   training.
   ResultsComparing before and after the learning strategies, any
   difference in the values of specificity and area under the ROC curve for
   all groups was found. Sensitivity was statistically significantly higher
   for G1 and G2. Comparing the groups, G2 showed a significant increase in
   sensitivity at the D-2 and D-3 thresholds. Spearman's correlations with
   the gold standard before and after the learning strategy were 0.60 and
   0.61 for G1, 0.57 and 0.63 for G2, and 0.54 and 0.54 for G3,
   respectively. The Wilcoxon test showed a statistically significant
   difference between the values obtained before and after learning
   strategies for G1 and G2.
   ConclusionsUse of the DLT after the ICDAS e-learning program tended to
   increase the sensitivity of ICDAS used by undergraduate dental students.
   The DLT appeared to improve dental students' ability to use ICDAS.},

Title = {The effects of web-based inquiry learning mode with the support of
   collaborative digital reading annotation system on information literacy
   instruction},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {179},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Past studies have indicated that primary schools' students have
   difficulty in filtering out incorrect or unreliable information from the
   Internet when facing a large amount of information due to the lack of
   basic digital literacy and sensitivity. Therefore, the establishment of
   a mechanism for information judgment and evaluation to promote primary
   schools' students digital reading skills and information literacy has
   become a more and more important research issue in recent years. This
   study thus developed a web-based inquiry learning mode with
   collaborative digital reading annotation system support (WILMCDRASS)
   aiming to provide innovative teaching mode of effectively enhancing
   information evaluation abilities of primary schools' students. A
   quasi-experimental design was conducted in this study to examine the
   learning effectiveness and technology acceptance of using WILM-CDRASS to
   enhance information evaluation abilities of primary schools' students
   compared to a web-based inquiry learning mode with general discussion
   board support (WILM-GDBS). A total of 50 Grade 5 students from two
   classes of an elementary school in New Taipei City of Taiwan
   participated in a collaborative inquiry-based learning course,
   ``Internet information judgment and evaluation,{''} in this study. A
   total of 25 students from a class was assigned as the experimental group
   using WILM-CDRASS to enhance their information evaluation abilities, and
   a total of 25 students from the remaining class was assigned as the
   control group using WILM-GDBS. The learning outcomes of WILM-CDRASS and
   WILM-GDBS in the learning effectiveness and technology acceptance were
   also compared between students with different prior knowledge levels and
   cognitive styles from both groups. The analytical results revealed that
   the learning effectiveness and technology acceptance of learners in the
   experimental group using WILM-CDRASS for an information literacy course
   are significantly superior to those of learners in the control group
   using WILM-GDBS. The research findings also showed that the use of
   WILM-CDRASS was more beneficial to the students with low prior knowledge
   and field-independent cognitive style than those of using WILMGDBS. As
   for technology acceptance, students with low prior knowledge perceived
   the use of WILMCDRASS more helpful than WILM-GDBS for their learning.
   Based on the research results, several suggestions for the
   implementation of WILM-CDRASS to support information literacy courses
   were proposed. Besides, it is suggested to investigate students'
   effective learning behaviors and the relationship between the learning
   behaviors and learning performance in inquiry-based information literacy
   courses with WILM-CDRASS support in future study.},

Title = {Can Individualized Learning Plans in an advanced clinical experience
   course for fourth year medical students foster Self-Directed Learning?},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Background: Residency programs have utilized Individualized Learning
   Plans (ILPs) to customize resident education while undergraduate medical
   education has not done so in a meaningful way. We discuss the use of
   ILPs within a fourth year medical school course to facilitate
   self-directed learning (SDL).
   Methods: At Stony Brook University School of Medicine, an ILP component
   was added to the Advanced Clinical Experience (ACE) course for fourth
   year students. Each completed an ILP outlining personal learning goals
   and strategies to achieve them. An adaptation of the Motivated
   Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) (Duncan T and McKeachie W,
   Educ Psych 40(2): 117-128, 2005 and Cook DA et al., Med Ed 45:
   1230-1240, 2011) was used to measure success of ILPs in improving SDL.
   Qualitative data analysis was conducted on the ILPs and
   self-reflections.
   Results: Forty-eight students participated. Two of the four SDL
   sub-domains identified on the MSLQ showed improvement; self-efficacy (p
   = .001) and self-regulation (p = .002). `Medical Knowledge' was the
   competency most frequently identified as an area of concentration (90
   \%) and professionalism was selected least frequently (4 \%). A higher
   percentage (83 \%) of students who reported complete achievement of
   their ILP goals also reported feeling better prepared for entering
   residency.
   Conclusions: ILPs improve SDL strategies among medical students and may
   serve as useful tools to help shape future learning goals as they
   transition to residency training.},

Abstract = {The freshman academic year is one of the most difficult years that a
   medical student experiences in his/her academic life at a medical
   school. Freshmen are frequently faced with several challenges, such as
   adaptation to a new academic environment and its associated different
   methods of teaching, learning, skills, and assessment. The aim of this
   study was to describe a 4-wk innovative summer premedical program
   developed by senior medical students at the College of Medicine,
   Alfaisal University, in an attempt to improve/smooth the experience(s)
   of prospective freshmen. This report describes the
   objectives/strategies/methodologies used to tackle the top three
   identified freshman challenges, namely, 1) advancement of the
   academic/scholastic/educational background, 2) the development of
   college-required skills to succeed and excel in the freshman year, and
   3) adaption to the college environment. At the end of the program, a
   survey was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the summer
   premedical program. Seventy-two students attended this program over the
   past three summers from 2010 to 2012, and twenty-nine students answered
   the survey with a response rate of 74.7\%. Overall, >90\% of the survey
   respondents reported an improvement in their understanding of basic
   medical science, integration, presentation skills, medical terminology,
   and junior-senior relationships. Furthermore, the survey highlighted the
   need for more focus on skills such as time management, participation in
   large-group discussions, and use of electronic resources, as >50\% of
   respondents reported no improvement in these areas. In conclusion, this
   is the first report, to our knowledge, that describes a program
   developed by senior medical students to improve the experience of
   freshmen.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, global engineers need to be equipped with professional skills
   and knowledge to solve 21st century problems. The educational program,
   created in digital learning rooms of the Higher Engineering Education
   Alliance Program (HEEAP) program supported by Arizona State University,
   became a pioneer in teaching learners to work within the community.
   First, the combination of a novel instructional strategy and an
   integrated education in which project-based approach is employed to
   apply the technical knowledge. During this, students in mechatronics,
   computer science, and mechanics must collaborate with peers from
   industrial systems engineering. Second, in this paper, the design of an
   open structure connecting multi-disciplinary major is illustrated with a
   new teaching approach. It is proved to be better by combining
   specialized understandings of various types in a wide range of
   applications. From this basis support, participants could implement
   additional components quickly while keeping the cost low, making the
   products feasible and user-friendly. Last but not least, students are
   facilitated with a free library that helps to control simply despite
   lacking experience in robotics or automation. Several examples show that
   students are capable of developing things by themselves on open design.
   In brief, this platform might be an excellent tool to teach and
   visualize the practical scenario in a multi-disciplinary field.},

Abstract = {Nearly half of all college students and the majority of college students
   of color begin their studies at 2-year colleges. The educational quality
   that these students experience will affect future success, but little
   research to date has focused on the professional development (PD) of
   their instructors. We offer an exploratory study on PD needs and
   preferences of ten 2-year college biology instructors who have
   experience with evidence-based instructional practices. Using a
   literature review and interview data, we address four research
   questions. We contextualize the interview results by describing
   interviewee teaching styles and their teaching and inclusion strategies,
   drawing on categorizations from education research literatures in and
   beyond biology. We then summarize interviewee experiences, preferences,
   and recommendations for PD. Most interviewees preferred PD that could be
   readily applied to their courses and included follow-up community
   support. While our purposive sample is limited, we note high levels of
   interest in PD supporting inclusive pedagogy and non-biology learning
   goals, such as study skills, metacognition, and quantitative skills. We
   describe implications for inclusive design of biology instructor PD.},

Abstract = {Most novice teachers and even some experienced teachers can lack
   appropriate tools for designing teaching strategies that ensure the
   quality of education. The ability of working in teams is crucial in
   educating professionals. The literature proves that social relations
   influence the performance of teams. For instance, the team cohesion is
   directly related with its performance. In this paper, we have developed
   an agent-based tool for assisting teachers in simulating their teaching
   strategies to estimate their influence on the group sociometrics like
   cohesion, coherence of reciprocal relations, dissociation, and density
   of relations. The experiments with nine scenarios in disciplines of
   computer science, electronic, psychology, business, tourism, and renewal
   energies with 239 students and 6 teachers including experienced and
   novice ones show that its underlying agent-based framework can adapt to
   different disciplines obtaining similar outcomes to the real ones. We
   learned that the tool was especially reliable in predicting the density
   of relations and the cohesion, being the latter one probably the most
   relevant due to its known relation with academic performance. In
   addition, we also learned that it was difficult to assess the prediction
   quality of the dissociation in higher education, due to the usual low
   amounts or absence of reciprocal rejections in the students' groups in
   this educational stage. The presented agent-based tool is publicly
   distributed as open source for facilitating other researchers in
   following this research line.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an innovative course designed to teach parallel
   computing to undergraduate students with significant hands-on
   experience. This course represents an introduction to the main topics of
   parallel, distributed and high-performance computing (HPC). The course
   introduces main concepts and architectures used in parallel computing
   today, and improve students' skills to develop parallel programs using
   major parallel programming paradigms: MPI (Message Passing Interface),
   OpenMP (Open-Multiprocessing). The main objective of the course is to
   teach practical parallel programming tools and techniques for MIMD with
   shared memory, MIMD with distributed memory and SIMD. Each of these
   software tools can be used to give students experience with
   parallelization strategies, and ability to rate the quality and
   effectiveness of parallel programs. We evaluate the success of our
   approach through the use of testing and survey and provide directions
   for further improvements in teaching parallel programming.},

Title = {Learning at distance: Effects of interaction traces on academic
   achievement},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {87},
Pages = {204-217},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Contemporary literature on online and distance education almost
   unequivocally argues for the importance of interactions in online
   learning settings. Nevertheless, the relationship between different
   types of interactions and learning outcomes is rather complex. Analyzing
   204 offerings of 29 courses, over the period of six years, this study
   aimed at expanding the current understanding of the nature of this
   relationship. Specifically, with the use of trace data about
   interactions and utilizing the multilevel linear mixed modeling
   techniques, the study examined whether frequency and duration of student
   student, student instructor, student system, and student content
   interactions had an effect of learning outcomes, measured as final
   course grades. The findings show that the time spent on student system
   interactions had a consistent and positive effect on the learning
   outcome, while the quantity of student content interactions was
   negatively associated with the final course grades. The study also
   showed the importance of the educational level and the context of
   individual courses for the interaction types supported. Our findings
   further confirmed the potential of the use of trace data and learning
   analytics for studying learning and teaching in online settings.
   However, further research should account for various qualitative aspects
   of the interactions used while learning, different pedagogical/media
   features, as well as for the course design and delivery conditions in
   order to better explain the association between interaction types and
   the learning achievement. Finally, the results might imply the need for
   the development of the institutional and program-level strategies for
   learning and teaching that would promote effective pedagogical
   approaches to designing and guiding interactions in online and distance
   learning settings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Objective. To evaluate the introduction of 10 Visual Thinking Strategies
   (VTS) sessions into year 2 of a Bachelor of Pharmacy (BPharm) program
   with the aim of assisting students in developing the skills and
   attitudes required for inclusive practice. Methods. The evaluation used
   a cross-sectional study design. All members of the first two successive
   student cohorts to complete multiple VTS sessions completed a 38-item
   online reflective questionnaire exploring student perceptions of
   competency development, transference, and session acceptability.
   Students were asked for their consent to include their responses in a
   research study. Closed-question responses were analyzed to produce
   descriptive statistics. Free-text responses were categorized and
   quantified using an inductive approach and manifest content analysis.
   Results. Fifty-six percent of the students (98 of 174) allowed their
   responses to be included in the study. Students generally believed the
   sessions had supported their development of person-centred
   communication, cultural competence, and critical thinking skills. The
   minimum level of agreement that improvement in an area occurred was
   74.5\%. Free-text responses revealed the perception of additional skill
   and attitude development. Sixty percent of participants had thought
   about the VTS questions or used what they had learned in the VTS
   sessions in other settings. Eighty-six percent of students agreed that
   content on VTS should remain in the BPharm curriculum. Conclusion.
   Incorporating regular VTS sessions into the second year of a BPharm
   program was acceptable to students. Data suggest that inclusion of
   multiple VTS sessions is a valuable addition to the pharmacy curriculum,
   offering affective learning experiences which support development and
   transference of key skills and attitudes relating to the provision of
   inclusive person-centred care.},

Title = {Process-oriented evaluation of an international faculty development
   program for Asian developing countries: a qualitative study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {DEC 21},
Abstract = {Background: Non-English-speaking developing countries in Southeast Asia
   have been provided only limited opportunities for faculty development in
   the education of health professions. Although there exist a few programs
   that have been shown to be effective, they are frequently presented with
   few explanations on how and why the programs work due to their
   outcome-oriented nature. This study explores the process of the Lee
   Jong-Wook Fellowship for Health Professional Education, an international
   faculty development program designed for capacity building of educators
   of health professions in Southeast Asian developing countries.
   Methods: Fellows were from Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos. Qualitative data
   were collected from two types of semi-structured interviews - group and
   individual. Thematic analysis was conducted to explore the factors
   related to the effectiveness of the program, framed by four components
   of faculty development, which included context, facilitators, program,
   and participants.
   Results: From the thematic analysis, the authors identified a total of
   12 themes in the four components of faculty development. In the context
   domain, the resource-poor setting, a culture that puts emphasis on
   hierarchy and seniority, and educational environment depending on
   individual commitment rather than broad consensus emerged as key
   factors. In the facilitators domain, their teaching methods and
   materials, mutual understanding between teacher and learner, and
   collaboration between facilitators mainly influenced the learning during
   the fellowship. In the program domain, the key advantages of the
   fellowship program were its applicability to the workplace of the
   fellows and enough allowed time for practice and reflection. Finally, in
   the participants domain, Fellows valued their heterogeneity of
   composition and recognized cognitive as well as non-cognitive attributes
   of the participants as essential.
   Conclusions: This process-oriented evaluation reveals the diverse
   factors that contributed to achieving the intended outcomes of the
   fellowship. Although much evidence from best practices in faculty
   development are still valid, the findings suggest that the selection
   strategies, learning environment, and English communication should be
   given more consideration when organizing a program targeting these
   people and cultures. A comprehensive understanding of the process would
   contribute to developing tailored strategies for educators of health
   professions in developing countries in similar settings.},

Abstract = {The emerging trend of teaching computer programming to more and younger
   people has led to the development of game-based learning and teaching
   approaches. In this context, educational games are considered as a
   promising learning platform. However, research in the field of
   programming games has mainly focused on what is being taught in these
   games. Less is known, however, about how programming games afford
   learning and playing by design. To address this, we performed a
   qualitative, comparative analysis of 19 programming games from an
   instructional and game attributes perspective. The findings showed that
   a majority of programming games presents only a moderate alignment with
   established instructional principles. Furthermore, significant
   differences in the presence and prevalence of their game attributes were
   found. Our analysis resulted in a systematic classification of
   programming games according to their alignment with instructional
   principles and their positioning on a playing-versus-programming
   spectrum. Informed by this twofold classification, we explored whether
   particular programming games can still be conceptualized as games, as
   opposed to learning or programming environments. Accordingly, we
   formulated opportunities and restrictions towards their potential
   context-of-use.},

Abstract = {Aim: Many factors affect learning outcomes, however studies comparing
   the effectiveness of different clinical teaching methods are limited. We
   utilize the list of influences on educational achievement compiled by
   John Hattie to inform a meta-analysis of learning effect sizes (ESs)
   associated with teaching-learning factors (TLFs) in clinical education.
   Methods: A literature search was conducted in PubMed to identify
   articles examining clinically relevant TLFs. Selection criteria were
   applied to identify learner-focused studies, with subsequent
   categorization by study design (pretest-posttest or controlled group).
   The Cohen's ES (d) for each TLF was extracted and a pooled ES
   determined. Results: From 3454 studies, 132 suitable articles enabled
   analysis of 16 TLFs' ESs. In general, ESs derived from pretest-posttest
   data were larger than those from controlled group designs, probably due
   to learner maturation effect. The TLFs of mastery learning, small group
   learning and goal settings possessed the largest ESs (d >= 0.8), while
   worked examples, play programs, questioning, concept mapping,
   meta-cognitive strategies, visual-perception programs and teaching
   strategies demonstrated ESs between 0.4 and 0.8. Conclusions: This is
   the first study to provide a rigorous and comprehensive overview of the
   effectiveness of TLFs in clinical education. We discuss the practical
   traits shared by effective TLFs which may assist teaching design.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an experience in developing technical skills and
   personal competences by an approach that integrates a group of teaching
   methodological tools and assessment coherently. It has been implemented
   for students of Engineering Project Management subject in the Industrial
   Technologies degree program of the Technical University of Madrid. The
   study shows how the authors face the new challenges that are caused by
   the adverse economic context by adopting effective countermeasures in
   the classroom. The results show that the specific teaching-learning
   strategy that we introduce enables the reinforcement of four competences
   simultaneously and the acquisition of subject knowledge at a high level,
   eventually guaranteeing the inclusive engineering educational system of
   the institution.},

Abstract = {The advent of the high-throughput next-generation sequencing produced a
   large number of biological data. Knowledge discovery from the huge
   amount of available biological data requires researchers to develop
   solid skills in biology and computer science. As the majority of the
   Bioinformatics professionals are either computer science or life
   sciences graduates, to teach biology skills to computer science students
   and computational skills to life science students has become usual. In
   this article, we reported the experience of teaching programming for
   life science students. Our strategy is composed by explaining basic
   concepts of algorithms, abstraction of biological problems, and script
   programming using Python language. Based on the student's answers to an
   assessment questionnaire, we conclude that the course achieved positive
   results. They reported an improvement in their skills in programming and
   bioinformatics. Furthermore, the students approved the didactic adopted
   in the classes and evaluation methods (programming exercises and final
   presentation). This article is useful for other professors who want to
   implement an initial bioinformatics training for undergraduate or
   graduate students in life sciences. We believe that the strategies here
   demonstrated could be reproduced, which could help in the formation of a
   new generation of bioinformaticians with hybrid abilities in computation
   and biology. (c) 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular

   A Pilot Study at the Universidad del Norte in Barranquilla, Colombia},

Abstract = {As part of an institutional program sponsored by the Centre for Teaching
   Excellence at the Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, we
   developed an educational research study on two sessions of human anatomy
   in which we combined team-based learning (TBL) and the use of iPads.
   Study data included the TBL, assessments applied during the course,
   student's grades on mid-term examinations and students' perceptions of
   their experiences. Students reported a positive attitude toward the use
   of the TBL sessions, and the results showed a significant improvement in
   their learning between the first and second sessions. Significantly
   positive correlations (P < 0.05) were obtained between (a) the
   individual students' readiness test performance 1 and mid-term
   examination 1, (b) the individual readiness test performances from
   Session 1 to Session 2, and (c) the group readiness test performances
   from the first and second sessions. These results point to positive
   learning experiences for these students. Analyses of the students'
   reflections on their activities also pointed toward future challenges.

Title = {A Strategy Based on Genetic Algorithms for Forming Optimal Collaborative
   Learning Groups: An Empirical Study},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Considering that group formation is key when developing activities in
   collaborative learning scenarios, this paper aims to propose a strategy
   based on a genetic algorithm approach for achieving optimal
   collaborative learning groups, considering the students' personality
   traits as grouping criteria. A controlled experiment was designed with
   238 students, quantifying their personality traits through the ``big
   five inventory{''} (BFI), forming working groups and developing a
   collaborative activity in programming and related courses. The
   experiment results allowed validation, not only from a computational
   point of view evaluating the algorithm performance but also from a
   pedagogical point of view, confronting the results obtained by students
   applying the proposed approach with those obtained through other group
   formation strategies. The highlight of the study is that those groups
   whose formation was pre-established by the teachers through the proposed
   strategy have generally had a better collaborative performance than the
   groups with traditional formation, except in the case of heterogeneous
   formation, at the time of developing a collaborative activity. In
   addition, through the experiment, it was found that not considering
   criteria related to personality traits before the group formation
   generally led to lower results.},

Title = {``We've Never Studied Bullying at University: Bullying-Related Beliefs,
   Training, and Strategies Among Physical Education Preservice Teachers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 21},
Abstract = {Purpose: To examine beliefs about bullying in physical education (PE)
   among PE preservice teachers and to examine opinions about training
   received in this area and the strategies they would use to deal with
   this phenomenon. Method: We interviewed 44 PE-PSTs (M-age = 23.91; SD =
   2.96) from six Spanish universities in semistructured focus groups. The
   data collected were analyzed using hierarchical content analysis.
   Results: PE preservice teachers believed that while PE may favor the
   occurrence of bullying, with proper management, it could also be used to
   educate students and create a positive climate that could help prevent
   this behavior. The trainee teachers stated that they had not received
   any training on bullying at university. Overall, they lacked confidence
   to deal with this problem, and their proposed strategies lacked depth.
   Conclusions: Our findings highlight the need for universities to include
   bullying in their PE teacher training programs.},

Abstract = {Rather than pursue questions related to learning in biology from
   separate camps, recent calls highlight the necessity of
   interdisciplinary research agendas. Interdisciplinary collaborations
   allow for a complicated and expanded approach to questions about
   learning within specific science domains, such as biology. Despite its
   benefits, interdisciplinary work inevitably involves challenges. Some
   such challenges originate from differences in theoretical and
   methodological approaches across lines of work. Thus, aims at developing
   successful interdisciplinary research programs raise important
   considerations regarding methodologies for studying biology learning,
   strategies for approaching collaborations, and training of early-career
   scientists. Our goal here is to describe two fields important to
   understanding learning in biology, discipline-based education research
   and the learning sciences. We discuss differences between each
   discipline's approach to biology education research and the benefits and
   challenges associated with incorporating these perspectives in a single
   research program. We then propose strategies for building productive
   interdisciplinary collaboration.},

Abstract = {Many students transitioning from high school to college are faced with
   challenges of getting acclimated to college life and managing their time
   and heavy course load that is cognitively demanding. Students planning
   to major in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
   programs in the United States are mostly required to enroll in general
   chemistry courses as prerequisites. Unfortunately, these courses are
   among the STEM gateway courses in which many first-year students
   struggle to get through, or are weeded out. This is partly due to the
   use of ineffective study strategies that require more than rote
   memorization, a common learning approach in high schools. One way to
   prepare first-year college students for STEM trajectories is by teaching
   them metacognitive strategies early in their study programs to enable
   early adoption and sustainability of metacognition knowledge and
   metacognition regulation skills as they progress to the advanced
   courses. While a handful of studies have investigated study strategies
   among students in the general chemistry courses as well as the impact of
   metacognitive activities on student performance in chemistry, very few
   in-depth qualitative studies investigating the influence of explicit
   teaching of metacognition on students' study strategies have been
   reported. Using open-ended questionnaires, this unique study
   investigated general chemistry students' study strategies that they
   employed prior to a 50 minute metacognition lesson; strategies they
   reported to have gained from the instruction; and the influence of the
   metacognition instruction on students' study strategies and performance
   in the final exam. Findings indicated more reported use of rote
   memorization over higher-order study strategies prior to the
   metacognition instruction, but more reported gains on higher-order study
   strategies and fewer strategies related to rote memorization immediately
   after the metacognition instruction. Furthermore, 67\% reported a
   positive influence of the metacognition instruction on study strategies,
   with 7\% lower DFs in the final exam compared to those who reported `no
   influence'. Findings revealed that most general chemistry students were
   unaware of effective study strategies; thus, there is a critical need to
   explicitly teach students in general chemistry courses metacognitive
   strategies.},

Title = {Social-Driven Propagation of Active Learning and Associated Scholarship
   Activity in Engineering: A Case Study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {36},

Pages = {1667-1680},
Abstract = {This research describes a pilot program for propagating active learning
   within engineering education starting with a group of nine interested
   instructors from two departments. The first and second authors served as
   the discipline-based coaches for these instructors, and the propagation
   program involved community discussions, one-on-one coaching, classroom
   observation, assessment of student perspectives, and feedback to and
   follow-up with the instructors. This approach aligned with the
   professional development and coaching literature as well as emergent
   change strategies identified by Henderson and colleagues. This work is
   important because STEM education has not generally taken a
   research-based approach to dissemination of pedagogical innovations, and
   research on sustained change is only in its early stages. Using a case
   study approach involving instructor interviews, documentary data (i.e.,
   discussion notes), and classroom observation, the program was assessed
   based upon instructor participation and accomplishments (including
   scholarship of teaching and learning activities), plans for continued
   active-learning use, and valuation. Of the nine initial instructors,
   seven participated in the one-year program until the end, including
   three who also engaged in scholarship of teaching and learning. All
   seven used active learning, as confirmed by observation or interview.
   Based on their interviews, instructors identified the program's
   ``people{''} focus, in particular one-on-one coaching and community
   discussions, as strengths of the program, as supported by the coaching
   literature. A finding of this research is that benefits were achieved
   despite non-ideal levels of instructor participation in all program
   aspects. The goal is to share an implementation and assessment approach
   with other educators considering relationship-driven, emergent
   strategies for adoption or expansion of active learning.},

Title = {Enhancing reflection on medical and surgical nursing among nursing
   students: A participatory action research study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {102},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Medical and Surgical Nursing (MSN) is a core course in
   baccalaureate nursing programs that requires active and effective
   teaching and learning strategies to enhance students' engagement.
   Objective: To develop and implement an effective learning process for
   students undertaking the MSN course.
   Design: This participatory action research study used reflection as the
   center of action in the cycle of planning, acting, observing and
   reflecting and re-planning.
   Setting: The study was conducted at a University in southern Taiwan.
   Participants: Thirty nursing students in their second year of a bachelor
   program in nursing, aged 19 to 20 years, were recruited via email and
   completed the study.
   Methods: The data were collected from February to June 2019 through
   reflective workshops, group discussions, individual interviews, and
   field notes. A qualitative content analysis was performed. Four criteria
   were considered to ensure the trustworthiness of the study process:
   reliability, validity, transferability, and authentic citations.
   Results: Four key themes-two challenges and two adaptive strategies -
   emerged in relation to the spiral process of improving teaching and
   learning in the MSN course. Participants experienced two main
   challenges: the large amount of multidisciplinary knowledge expected,
   and the rapid pace of the course. The two adaptive strategies were:
   recognizing their own unique way of learning and becoming an active
   learner and achiever.
   Conclusions: The project helped students to identify their own learning
   challenges, recognize the need to modify their attitudes and approaches
   to learning, improve teaching and learning in the MSN course, and
   identify the characteristics relevant to becoming an active learner and
   achiever.},

Abstract = {Background Simulation has been widely used in the teaching of
   pre-licensed nursing students and has shown positive results. However,
   there is limited evidence regarding the application of a comprehensive
   nursing course with simulation for Associated Degree in Nursing
   (ADN)-prepared nurses with different work experience times. Therefore,
   this study aimed to evaluate the satisfaction, self-confidence, and
   perceptions of scenario simulation among Chinese nurses in a
   comprehensive nursing skills course in an RN-BSN program. Methods A
   single-group post-test approach was used in the current study.
   Participants that completed a comprehensive nursing skills course with
   simulation in an RN-BSN program were enrolled. Results The mean
   satisfaction, self-confidence, educational practice, and simulation
   designs scores were rated highly. Self-confidence (p = 0.002), active
   learning (p = 0.020), collaboration (p = 0.030), support (p = 0.008),
   and problem-solving (p = 0.007) were significantly higher among students
   with more work experience compared to those with less experience. Then,
   four themes were analyzed: enthusiasm for learning, ability to
   experience different feelings during role-play, hybrid teaching format,
   and simulation fidelity. Conclusions Results demonstrated that a
   comprehensive nursing skills course with simulation might improve
   Chinese ADN-prepared nurses' satisfaction and self-confidence in
   learning. Nurses with work experience gave a high rate to the scenario
   simulation, demonstrating that simulation can be widely applicable for
   students with different characteristics. Finally, the teaching strategy
   in the present study can be applied to more RN-BSN programs.},

Title = {Using an ACTIVE teaching format versus a standard lecture format for
   increasing resident interaction and knowledge achievement during noon
   conference: a prospective, controlled study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Background: The traditional lecture is used by many residency programs
   to fulfill the mandate for regular didactic sessions, despite limited
   evidence to demonstrate its effectiveness. Active teaching strategies
   have shown promise in improving medical knowledge but have been
   challenging to implement within the constraints of residency training.
   We developed and evaluated an innovative structured format for
   interactive teaching within the residency noon conference.
   Methods: We developed an ACTIVE teaching format structured around the
   following steps: assemble (A) into groups, convey (C) learning
   objectives, teach (T) background information, inquire (I) through cases
   and questions, verify (V) understanding, and explain (E) answer choices
   and educate on the learning points. We conducted a prospective,
   controlled study of the ACTIVE teaching format versus the standard
   lecture format, comparing resident satisfaction, immediate knowledge
   achievement and long-term knowledge retention. We qualitatively assessed
   participating faculty members' perspectives on the faculty development
   efforts and the feasibility of teaching using the ACTIVE format.
   Results: Sixty-nine internal medicine residents participated in the
   study. Overall, there was an improvement in perceived engagement using
   the ACTIVE teaching format (4.78 vs. 3.80, P < 0.01), with no increase
   in stress or decrement in break time. There was an improvement in
   initial knowledge achievement with the ACTIVE teaching format (overall
   absolute score increase of 11\%, P = 0.04) and a trend toward
   improvement in long-term knowledge retention. Faculty members felt
   adequately prepared to use the ACTIVE teaching format, and enjoyed
   teaching with the ACTIVE teaching format more than the standard lecture.
   Conclusions: A structured ACTIVE teaching format improved resident
   engagement and initial knowledge, and required minimal resources. The
   ACTIVE teaching format offers an exciting alternative to the standard
   lecture for resident noon conference and is easy to implement.},

Title = {Demand Response Strategy Based on Reinforcement Learning and Fuzzy
   Reasoning for Home Energy Management},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {39310-39321},
Abstract = {As energy demand continues to increase, demand response (DR) programs in
   the electricity distribution grid are gaining momentum and their
   adoption is set to grow gradually over the years ahead. Demand response
   schemes seek to incentivise consumers to use green energy and reduce
   their electricity usage during peak periods which helps support grid
   balancing of supply-demand and generate revenue by selling surplus of
   energy back to the grid. This paper proposes an effective energy
   management system for residential demand response using Reinforcement
   Learning (RL) and Fuzzy Reasoning (FR). RL is considered as a model-free
   control strategy which learns from the interaction with its environment
   by performing actions and evaluating the results. The proposed algorithm
   considers human preference by directly integrating user feedback into
   its control logic using fuzzy reasoning as reward functions. Q-learning,
   a RL strategy based on a reward mechanism, is used to make optimal
   decisions to schedule the operation of smart home appliances by shifting
   controllable appliances from peak periods, when electricity prices are
   high, to off-peak hours, when electricity prices are lower without
   affecting the customer\& x2019;s preferences. The proposed approach
   works with a single agent to control 14 household appliances and uses a
   reduced number of state-action pairs and fuzzy logic for rewards
   functions to evaluate an action taken for a certain state. The
   simulation results show that the proposed appliances scheduling approach
   can smooth the power consumption profile and minimise the electricity
   cost while considering user\& x2019;s preferences, user\& x2019;s
   feedbacks on each action taken and his/her preference settings. A
   user-interface is developed in MATLAB/Simulink for the Home Energy
   Management System (HEMS) to demonstrate the proposed DR scheme. The
   simulation tool includes features such as smart appliances, electricity
   pricing signals, smart meters, solar photovoltaic generation, battery
   energy storage, electric vehicle and grid supply.},

Abstract = {This study explores students' cognitive processes while debugging
   programs by using an eye tracker. Students' eye movements during
   debugging were recorded by an eye tracker to investigate whether and how
   high- and low-performance students act differently during debugging.
   Thirty-eight computer science undergraduates were asked to debug two C
   programs. The path of students' gaze while following program codes was
   subjected to sequential analysis to reveal significant sequences of
   areas examined. These significant gaze path sequences were then compared
   to those of students with different debugging performances. The results
   show that, when debugging, high-performance students traced programs in
   a more logical manner, whereas low-performance students tended to stick
   to a line-by-line sequence and were unable to quickly derive the
   program's higher-level logic. Low-performance students also often jumped
   directly to certain suspected statements to find bugs, without following
   the program's logic. They also often needed to trace back to prior
   statements to recall information, and spent more time on manual
   computation. Based on the research results, adaptive instructional
   strategies and materials can be developed for students of different
   performance levels, to improve associated cognitive activities during
   debugging, which can foster learning during debugging and programming.},

Title = {Developing an understanding of research-based nursing pedagogy among
   clinical instructors: A qualitative study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {34},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1352-1356},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Effective instruction is imperative to the learning process
   of clinical nursing instructors. Faculty members are required to provide
   high-quality teaching and training by using new ways of teaching
   pedagogical methods to clinical instructors, which have transformed
   pedagogies from an exclusive clinical model to a holistic model.
   Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore clinical instructors'
   use of planning, implementation, feedback loops, and reflection
   frameworks to apply research-based teaching and to examine the pedagogy
   used during field experience.
   Method: Data for the qualitative study were obtained from twenty
   purposefully sampled clinical teachers (n = 20) via lists of questioned
   instructional practices and discussions, semi-structured interviews,
   observational notes, field notes, and written reflections. Data were
   analyzed by using a triangulation method to ensure trustworthiness,
   credibility, and reliability.
   Findings: Three main themes emerged regarding the use of research-based
   teaching strategies: the need for learning about research-based
   pedagogy, support mechanisms to implement innovative teaching
   strategies, and transitioning from nursing student to nursing clinical
   instructors.
   Conclusion: It has been well documented that the nursing profession
   faces a serious shortage of nursing faculty, impacting the quality of
   clinical teaching. Developing clinical instructor programs to give
   students opportunities to select instructor pathways, focusing on
   knowledge promoting critical thinking and life-long professional
   development, is essential. Nursing colleges must collaborate by using a
   partnership model to achieve competency in planning, implementation,
   feedback loops, and reflection. Applying research-based clinical
   teaching requires the development of programs that integrate
   low-fidelity simulation and assisted instruction through the use of
   computers in Nursing Colleges. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& DECISION MAKING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 29},
Abstract = {This paper presents a method for identifying causal relationships
   between strategic objectives within a strategy map of a Balanced
   Scorecard. Strategy maps are modeled as a network of strategic
   objectives (nodes) and causal relationships (directed arcs). The nodes
   are also grouped into clusters that represent the perspectives of a
   Balanced Scorecard: (a) Finances, Clients, Internal Processes and Growth
   and Learning. The method uses the Analytic Network Process (ANP) to
   establish the importance of every relationship and uses a
   multi-objective integer linear programming model to select the
   relationships to be included within a strategy map of a company. The
   method provides a method that optimizes the selection of the
   relationships to be included in a strategy map. An illustration of the
   application of the method in a manufacturing company is presented.},

Title = {The influence of a web-based learning environment on low achievers'
   science argumentation},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {151},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The present study developed a web-based argumentation program (WAP) to
   support the science concept and argumentation learning of low achievers
   (LAs) in socio-scientific issue (SSI) contexts. A quasi-experimental
   design was applied in the present study. A total of 63 eighth-grade LAs
   were defined as the experimental group, while 62 of their peers who were
   medium achievers (MAs) were defined as the control group. The WAP was
   developed based on three principles to address the specific needs of the
   LAs: visualizability, interactivity, and multiplicity. The statistical
   results showed that both the MAs and LAs exhibited significant
   improvements in both conceptual learning and argumentation learning.
   However, the LAs acquired better and more balanced improvement in their
   science argumentation learning. They even outperformed their peers in
   the MA group in terms of using level 1 claims and qualifiers in the WAP.
   Meanwhile, the qualitative analysis showed that both the LAs and MAs had
   no problems with using claims, warrants, or rebuttals. Most of the LAs
   basically saw the SSI argumentation as a competition and understood that
   they could potentially strengthen their arguments by citing evidence.
   However, they found it difficult to construct higher level qualifiers
   because they had difficulty perceiving the limitations of their own
   arguments. The co-constructions in the WAP were a main factor
   influencing the degree and sequence of the LAs' improvements in using
   claims, warrants, and rebuttals. We subdivided their co-constructions
   into two types: opposed and supportive. The two types of coconstructions
   provided the students with various paths through which they can reflect
   on and evaluate their knowledge. This indicates that there is much
   potential for the further development of web-based scaffolding in order
   to facilitate argumentation learning for LAs.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we report on the implementation of a novel
   compute-to-learn pedagogy, which is based upon the theories of situated
   cognition and meaningful learning. The compute-to-learn pedagogy is
   designed to simulate an authentic research experience as part of the
   undergraduate curriculum, including project development, teamwork, peer
   review, and publication. The compute-to-learn pedagogy was piloted
   during the Fall 2015 semester within a one-semester, peer-led honors
   studio environment that uses active learning strategies to encourage
   cooperation and collaboration among students as they learn how to
   program. The rationale behind the pedagogy, lessons learned, and
   adjustments made based on three iterations of its execution, and its
   initial assessment through end-of-semester interviews are discussed.},

Abstract = {Wave phenomena are fundamental for many branches of physics, not only
   for mechanics. Thus, students at university level should become familiar
   with the underlying theory, and especially with solutions of the wave
   equation. This paper refers to a multimedia program for PCs, tablets or
   smartphones, and introduces and discusses several animated
   illustrations. The introduced program can illustrate the power of the
   wave equation. Basic wave phenomena can be computed with numerical
   methods. The finite difference method which is used can be lead back to
   fundamental assumptions of physics. Yet, this numerical method is
   capable of calculating a great variety of wave phenomena. Several
   examples can demonstrate the power of this numerical procedure.
   Phenomena like the propagation of circular waves diverging from a point
   source, Huygens's elementary waves, superposition of waves, reflexion,
   refraction and transmission at the interface between different media,
   scattering, interference phenomena, as well as dispersion and the
   Doppler effect can be studied in animated visualisations. This opens up
   a variety of teaching and learning strategies, e.g. the single concept
   principle and the inverted classroom concept, and the modelling of
   partial differential equations (the wave equation as well as the heat
   equation) can be supported. The conceptual approach is described here;
   an empirical study about learning will be a next step.},

Title = {Bridging the Gap: A Framework and Strategies for Integrating the Quality
   and Safety Mission of Teaching Hospitals and Graduate Medical Education},

Abstract = {Integrating the quality and safety mission of teaching hospitals and
   graduate medical education (GME) is a necessary step to provide the next
   generation of physicians with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes they
   need to participate in health system improvement. Although many teaching
   hospital and health system leaders have made substantial efforts to
   improve the quality of patient care, few have fully included residents
   and fellows, who deliver a large portion of that care, in their efforts.
   Despite expectations related to the engagement of these trainees in
   health care quality improvement and patient safety outlined by the
   Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in the Clinical
   Learning Environment Review program, a structure for approaching this
   integration has not been described.
   In this article, the authors present a framework that they hope will
   assist teaching hospitals in integrating residents and fellows into
   their quality and safety efforts and in fostering a positive clinical
   learning environment for education and patient care. The authors define
   the six essential elements of this framework-organizational culture,
   teaching hospital-GME alignment, infrastructure, curricular resources,
   faculty development, and interprofessional collaboration. They then
   describe the organizational characteristics required for each element
   and offer concrete strategies to achieve integration. This framework is
   meant to be a starting point for the development of robust national
   models of infrastructure, alignment, and collaboration between GME and
   health care quality and safety leaders at teaching hospitals.},

Title = {Autonomous Vehicle Fuel Economy Optimization with Deep Reinforcement

Abstract = {The ever-increasing number of vehicles on the road puts pressure on car
   manufacturers to make their car fuel-efficient. With autonomous
   vehicles, we can find new strategies to optimize fuels. We propose a
   reinforcement learning algorithm that trains deep neural networks to
   generate a fuel-efficient velocity profile for autonomous vehicles given
   road altitude information for the planned trip. Using a highly accurate
   industry-accepted fuel economy simulation program, we train our deep
   neural network model. We developed a technique for adapting the
   heterogeneous simulation program on top of an open-source deep learning
   framework, and reduced dimension of the problem output with suitable
   parameterization to train the neural network much faster. The learned
   model combined with reinforcement learning-based strategy generation
   effectively generated the velocity profile so that autonomous vehicles
   can follow to control itself in a fuel efficient way. We evaluate our
   algorithm's performance using the fuel economy simulation program for
   various altitude profiles. We also demonstrate that our method can teach
   neural networks to generate useful strategies to increase fuel economy
   even on unseen roads. Our method improved fuel economy by 8\% compared
   to a simple grid search approach.},

Title = {WLAN Fingerprint Indoor Positioning Strategy Based on Implicit
   Crowdsourcing and Semi-Supervised Learning},
Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {Wireless local area network (WLAN) fingerprint positioning is an indoor
   localization technique with high accuracy and low hardware requirements.
   However, collecting received signal strength (RSS) samples for the
   fingerprint database is time-consuming and labor-intensive, hindering
   the use of this technique. The popular crowdsourcing sampling technique
   has been introduced to reduce the workload of sample collection, but has
   two challenges: one is the heterogeneity of devices, which can
   significantly affect the positioning accuracy; the other is the
   requirement of users' intervention in traditional crowdsourcing, which
   reduces the practicality of the system. In response to these challenges,
   we have proposed a new WLAN indoor positioning strategy, which
   incorporates a new preprocessing method for RSS samples, the implicit
   crowdsourcing sampling technique, and a semi-supervised learning
   algorithm. First, implicit crowdsourcing does not require users'
   intervention. The acquisition program silently collects unlabeled
   samples, the RSS samples, without information about the position.
   Secondly, to cope with the heterogeneity of devices, the preprocessing
   method maps all the RSS values of samples to a uniform range and
   discretizes them. Finally, by using a large number of unlabeled samples
   with some labeled samples, Co-Forest, the introduced semi-supervised
   learning algorithm, creates and repeatedly refines a random forest
   ensemble classifier that performs well for location estimation. The
   results of experiments conducted in a real indoor environment show that
   the proposed strategy reduces the demand for large quantities of labeled
   samples and achieves good positioning accuracy.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the effects of instruction offered via
   different learning environments Second Life (SL) as a 3D world versus
   Enocta learning management system (LMS)/Adobe Connect Pro as a web-based
   environment on distance education students' academic achievement related
   to structured query language (SQL) and attitudes toward web-based
   instruction. The study used the embedded experimental model. A total of
   60 distance education students participated in the study. Based on their
   pretest academic achievement scores, 30 students were assigned to the
   experimental group who took the SL class while 30 were assigned to the
   control group who took the Enocta LMS/Adobe Connect Pro class. The same
   instructor taught the same course, Database 211, using the same
   instructional methods and materials but different learning environments
   (SL for the experimental group and Enocta LMS/Adobe Connect Pro for the
   control group). The data were collected using the web-based instruction
   attitude scale, an academic achievement test on database and SQL, in
   addition to an open-ended questionnaire. The results showed that there
   was no statistically significant difference between the experimental and
   control groups in terms of academic achievement. However, in terms of
   attitudes toward web-based instruction, a statistically significant
   difference was found between the experimental and control groups in
   favor of the experimental group.},

Abstract = {Rapid methodological and technological progresses motivate the
   implementation of continuing education programs. In this scenario,
   collaboration between universities and industries plays an important
   role. Universities can offer the theoretical knowledge and the best
   teaching practices while industries can provide equipment, use cases,
   and other key resources. In this paper, we present a cooperative
   university-industry approach to satisfy the continuing education needs
   of a Research and Development department that operates in the Heating,
   Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) sector. In particular,
   strategies and guidelines for continuing education in modeling and
   simulation practices are presented, with particular emphasis on HVAC
   systems. In the paper, the learning needs, learning outcomes definition,
   course contents design, instructional methods, participants performance
   assessment, and course evaluation are discussed.},

Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},

Abstract = {Introduction: Educational environment (EE) in a health educational
   institute can bring about an enduring impact on the students'
   motivation, knowledge, critical thinking along with their social life.
   Therefore, identifying strengths and the need for change in the
   education environment is vital for the enhancement of the students'
   learning.
   Objective: This study aimed to compare the perceptions of nursing and
   medical students about their EE in a private university, Karachi
   Pakistan.
   Methodology: Data from two cross-sectional studies of 884 students from
   both medical and nursing schools of Aga Khan University was acquired and
   analyzed. EE was measured by a well-known inventory i.e. `Dundee'
   Reading Educational Environment Measure (DREEM). The scores were
   constructed using standardized guidelines. Mann-Whitney U test and two
   way ANOVA were used in statistical analysis.
   Results: With 84.1\% average response rate, the mean + SD DREEM score
   was measured as 126 +/- 20.3. Nursing students regarded more positive
   perception about their EE (127.3 +/- 19.3) as compared to medical
   students (124.6 +/- 21.3) and was found to be statistically significant
   (P = 0.027). Medical students scored higher in the domain of Perception
   of Atmosphere (PoA); whereas, nursing students scored higher in Academic
   Self Perception (ASP). Both of the groups have rated lower scores on the
   domain of Perception of Teaching (PoT).
   Conclusion: Both medical and nursing students appreciated the EE
   pertaining to Perception of Learning (PoA), Academic Self-Perception
   (ASP), Perception of learning (PoL) and Social Self-perception (SSP).
   The study showed that nursing students' perception on their EE was
   relatively more satisfactory than medical students. However, both
   medical and nursing students identified areas of improvement in the
   domain of Perception of Teaching (PoT). This finding indicates dire need
   to devise innovative teaching strategies both for medical \& nursing
   education.},

Abstract = {Over 1.7 billion students around the world have had their education
   disrupted by the spread of the Coronavirus disease worldwide. Schools
   and universities have not faced this level of disruption since World War
   II. The COVID-19 pandemic presented a colossal challenge for teachers to
   urgently and massively adapt all their classes to distance learning in
   order to maintain educational continuity with the same quality. Even if
   some teachers and certain classes were ready to face the situation, a
   large majority had to adapt their teaching and learning in a very short
   time without training, with insufficient bandwidth, and with little
   preparation. This unexpected and rapid transition to online learning has
   led to a multiplication of teachers' strategies for distance learning in
   lectures, tutorials, project groups, lab works, and assessments. The
   purpose of this paper is to present the feedback from students and
   teachers who participated in the lockdown semester of two different
   groups of a 5-year program in Chemistry, Environment and Chemical
   Engineering (100 students) at INSA Toulouse (France). The analysis has
   highlighted some great successes and some failures in the solutions
   proposed. Consequently, some guidelines can be given to help us all to
   learn the lessons of such a singular experience in order to face the
   unexpected future with more knowledge and more successful distance
   learning. Teachers have shown very strong resilience during this crisis,
   at the cost of significant personal commitment. They admit that they
   have learned more about distance education in two months than in the
   last 10 years.},

Title = {Learning relationships in community-based service-learning: a social
   network analysis},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {BackgroundLittle is known about the social learning of students within
   community-based clinical placements and ways in which it can be
   supported. In an allied health service-learning program, we analysed
   students' learning relationships to quantify what, and from whom
   students learnt.MethodsWe conducted a social learning network survey in
   four domains of learning (clinical knowledge, procedural skills,
   professional development, and complex determinants of health) to explore
   learning relationships (ties) with other people (alters) that students
   (egos) formed during their placement. We quantified how different roles
   (supervisors, health professionals, administrators, peers,
   schoolteachers, and clients) contributed to the students' learning in
   each of the four domains. We used exponential random graph models
   (ERGMs) to test which relational processes contributed to the structure
   of the observed learning networks.ResultsData was available from a
   complete cohort of 10 students on placement in a network of 69 members,
   thus providing information on 680 potential learning relations. Students
   engaged in similar ways in the domains of clinical knowledge, procedural
   skills, and professional development. Learning relations with academic
   supervisors were significantly more likely. Also students reported
   reciprocal learning relations with peers - i.e. they formed learning
   pairs. This effect was absent in learning networks about complex
   determinants of health (including socio-economic and cultural factors).
   Instead, local administrative staff were significantly more often the
   source of learning about the local contextual
   factors.ConclusionsUnderstanding the structure of student learning
   networks through social network analysis helps identify targeted
   strategies to enhance learning in community-based service-learning
   programs. Our findings suggest students recognised important learning
   from each other and from administrative personnel that is unrelated to
   the content of their placement. Based on this insight clinical educators
   could prepare students to become agentic learners, learning with each
   other and from sources outside their program.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates permutation flow shop scheduling (PFSS) problems
   under the effects of position-dependent learning and linear
   deterioration. In a PFSS problem, there arenjobs andmmachines in series.
   Jobs are separated into operations onm different machines in series, and
   jobs have to follow the same machine order with the same sequence. The
   PFSS problem under the effects of learning and deterioration is
   introduced with a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model. The time
   requirement for solving large-scale problems type of PFSS problem is
   exceedingly high. Therefore, well-known metaheuristic methods for the
   PFSS problem without learning and deterioration effects such as iterated
   greedy algorithms and discrete differential evolution algorithm are
   adapted for the problem with learning and deterioration effects in order
   to find a faster and near-optimal or optimal solution for the problem.
   Furthermore, this paper proposes a hybrid solution algorithm that is
   called population-based Tabu search algorithm (TSPOP) with evolutionary
   strategies such as crossover and mutation. The search algorithm is built
   on the basic structure of Tabu search and it searches for the best
   candidate from a solution population instead of improving the current
   best candidate at each iteration. Furthermore, the performances of these
   methods in view of solution quality are discussed in this paper by using
   test problems for 20, 50, and 100 jobs with 5, 10, 20 machines.
   Experimental results show that the proposed TS(POP)algorithm outperforms
   the other existing algorithms in view of solution quality.},

Abstract = {How can students in a large classroom benefit from virtual reality
   (VR)-based instruction despite limited equipment? Group debriefing based
   on observed VR experiences provides a potential solution. This study
   employed a two-by-two factorial design to empirically investigate the
   feasibility and effectiveness of debriefing and types of VR experiences
   on enhancing VR learning outcomes. Second and third graders (n = 150)
   were randomly assigned to one of the four VR learning conditions: (1)
   performing individually with individual debriefing, (2) performing
   individually with no debriefing, (3) observing in a group with group
   debriefing, and (4) observing in a group with no debriefing. Study
   results reported moderate effect sizes of debriefing on increasing
   knowledge test as well as performance scores of the VR learners but
   revealed no significant difference between direct and observed VR
   learning experiences. The findings reveal that students can benefit from
   vicarious VR learning experiences if an instructional component of
   debriefing is provided in educational practice.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Abstract = {A critical challenge in the energy management of hybrid electric
   vehicles is how to intelligently distribute the power between engine and
   electric motor with a significant reduction in fuel consumption and
   emissions. In this paper, iterative dynamic programming (IDP) and
   adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (ANFIS)-based energy management
   strategy was proposed for a parallel hybrid electric bus. First, IDP was
   used to obtain the optimal control trajectories for a specific driving
   cycle. During the iterative process, a modified gear-shifting strategy
   was introduced to achieve a good tradeoff between the fuel economy and
   the drivability performance. Next, multi-ANFIS networks were designed
   and trained to learn the control law from the available optimal
   trajectories. Finally, the real-time energy management controller based
   on the IDP-ANFIS was built to coordinate the output of the two power
   sources, which reduces the fuel consumption and emissions. The
   simulation and experimental results reveal that the IDP-ANFIS is
   feasible, and the performance is superior to that of the equivalent
   consumption minimization strategy and rule-based method.},

Title = {Moodle and Socrative quizzes as formative aids on theory teaching in a
   chemical engineering subject},
Journal = {EDUCATION FOR CHEMICAL ENGINEERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {36},
Pages = {54-64},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {There is a majority opinion on the positive influence of using
   technologies in teaching. However, few studies account for their effect
   on students' final grades. Traditional theory teaching often shows a
   lack of students' motivation, engagement and self-efficacy. A way to
   improve these is to include quizzes, which may allow students to gain in
   skills acquisition feedback and self-regulation, and to control their
   own way to construct knowledge. The suggested methodology embeds quizzes
   and tests through two ICT, each one with a different strategy. One is
   the use of quick and real-time quizzes with Socrative, focused in
   promoting motivation and engagement in the classroom. The second is the
   use of tests with Moodle for a longer time scale (blocks of lessons).
   Both tests and quizzes were designed as formative activities: the
   students are able to gain feed-back, weaknesses identification and
   better programming of their work. Three `tools' (one Moodle test; three
   Socrative quizzes; no tool/only traditional teaching) were rotated among
   three different cohorts and blocks in a Chemical Engineering subject
   (n=49 students). Effects on the students' learning outcomes (grades) at
   the final theory exam were evaluated by blocks. A paired-data one-factor
   ANOVA test showed no significant statistical differences in using Moodle
   tests or Socrative quizzes or not. Some possible negative influences
   over data were identified and improvements for further study have been
   suggested. An intensification of quizzes and tests could be relevant.
   Although no significant improvement over grades was obtained, the use of
   both tools was positively valued for students and instructors. Surveys'
   results showed that the proposed methodology may create a more
   attractive and self-regulated educational environment. However, this
   study supports that students' previous perceptions about the tools may
   condition their final perceptions over the ICTs real aid for learning
   and their future academic outcomes. (c) 2021 Institution of Chemical

Title = {Formal Reachability Analysis for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
   Systems},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {45812-45821},
Abstract = {Reachability analysis is one of the most basic and challenging problems
   in verification. We investigate this problem in multi-agent
   reinforcement learning (MARL) system by transforming the reachability
   analysis to decision-making problem tackled by mixed integer linear
   programming (MILP) solver Gurobi. We define syntax and semantics for
   multi-role strategy logic (mrSL) which is used to describe the
   reachability specification. The logic mrSL is a variant of SL to express
   properties, which provide a holistic perspective to describe
   reachability properties instead of specifying a specific agent reaches a
   certain state in the MARL system. And the algorithms to translate
   reachability property into MILP constraints are provided. A tool called
   MAReachAnalysis is introduced, which uses Gurobi to solve the
   corresponding reachability problem and evaluate it on the predator-prey
   task of multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) example,
   discussion of the experimental results obtained on a range of test
   cases.},

   Strategies to Change Knowledge and Attitudes Towards Sharks},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {50},
Number = {3},
Pages = {345-357},
Abstract = {This study was designed to exemplify how hands-on based teaching
   strategies enhanced students' knowledge and positive attitudes towards
   sharks. Hands-on activities for sharks' biological and morphological
   features were carried out. Eleven elementary school students from a
   remote area in Taiwan were recruited and assigned to the hands-on
   condition. They were encouraged to draw pictures of sharks before and
   after the instruction as the main data for pre- and post-test
   comparison. Two years later, the retention test and attitude inventory
   towards sharks were implemented. The results revealed that large effect
   size emerged for both the post-test and retention test. In regards to
   attitude inventory, students involved in hands-on activities also
   significantly outperformed the baseline group. Many of them have taken
   notice of television programs and books about sharks or marine ecology
   since the hands-on activities, indicating the instruction had a
   beneficial impact on their extracurricular lives. Empirical findings of
   this study suggest hands-on instruction is a powerful strategy for
   learning, both for immediate and prolonged effects on improving
   students' knowledge and attitudes toward sharks.},

Title = {Teaching efficacy of nurses in clinical practice education: A
   cross-sectional study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Clinical nurses play a vital role in clinical practice
   education; thus, it is necessary to help clinical nurses have teaching
   efficacy through the development and application of systematic education
   programs.
   Objectives: To identify nurses' teaching efficacy for clinical education
   and analyze the influencing factors of teaching efficacy.
   Design and Methods: The study used a cross-sectional design. We used a
   convenience sample of 263 nurses from two hospitals. Teaching efficacy,
   general characteristics, and perception of clinical practice education
   were collected via self-reported questionnaires. Teaching efficacy was
   measured using Hwang's (2006) questionnaire, while perception of
   clinical practice education was measured using the Clinical Nurse
   Teacher Survey developed by Nishioka et al. (2014). Participants
   completed the questionnaire directly. The collected data were then
   analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-tests, ANOVAs, and multiple
   regression analysis with PASW Statistics 18.0.
   Results: The mean total score of teaching efficacy was 72.5 (range
   21-105). The leadership for students subscale had the highest score
   (3.56 +/- 0.59). The factors influencing teaching efficacy were length
   of clinical career (beta = 0.26, p < 0.001) and perceptions of work
   satisfaction (beta = 0.20, p = .005), clinical supervisory relationship
   (beta = 0.18, p = .010), and nursing at the hospital ward (beta = 0.13,
   p = .029). Altogether, these variables explained 28\% of the variance in
   teaching efficacy in nurses.
   Conclusion: Based on these results, nursing educators might need to
   develop greater confidence in their knowledge and enhance control of
   their teaching strategies. Nursing schools and hospitals might need to
   provide greater support and educational opportunities to nurse clinical
   practice instructors. Furthermore, constructing a system of cooperation
   between these colleges and educational hospitals, developing programs to
   enhance teaching efficacy, and identifying the clinical instructor's
   role are all necessary to promote clinical practice education.},

Abstract = {By engaging in construction-based robotics activities, children as young
   as four can play to learn a range of concepts. The TangibleK Robotics
   Program paired developmentally appropriate computer programming and
   robotics tools with a constructionist curriculum designed to engage
   kindergarten children in learning computational thinking, robotics,
   programming, and problem-solving. This paper documents three
   kindergarten classrooms' exposure to computer programming concepts and
   explores learning outcomes. Results point to strengths of the curriculum
   and areas where further redesign of the curriculum and technologies
   would be appropriate. Overall, the study demonstrates that
   kindergartners were both interested in and able to learn many aspects of
   robotics, programming, and computational thinking with the TangibleK
   curriculum design. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a Multitree Genetic Programming-based method is developed
   to learn an INTerpretable and ACcurate Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy
   rule based sYstem (MGP-INTACTSKY) for dynamic portfolio trading. The
   MGP-INTACTSKY utilizes a TSK model with a new structure to develop a
   more interpretable and accurate system for dynamic portfolio trading. In
   the new structure of TSK, disjunctive normal form rules with variable
   structured consequent parts are developed in which the absence of some
   input variables is allowed. Input variables are the most influential
   technical indices which are selected by stepwise regression analysis.
   The technical indices are computed using wavelet transformed stock price
   series to eliminate the noise. The proposed system directly induces the
   preferred portfolio weights from the stock's technical indices through
   time. Here, genetic programming with the multitree structure is applied
   to learn the TSK fuzzy rule bases with the Pittsburgh approach. With
   this approach, the correlation of different stocks is properly
   considered during the evolutionary process. To evaluate the performance
   of the MGP-INTACTSKY for portfolio trading, the proposed model is
   implemented on the Tehran Stock Exchange as an emerging market as well
   as Toronto and Frankfurt Stock Exchanges as two mature markets. The
   experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms other
   methods such as the momentum strategy, the multitree genetic
   programming-based crisp system, the genetic algorithm-based first order
   TSK system, the buy and hold approach and the market's main index in
   terms of accuracy and interpretability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Improving Transfer of Learning: An Innovative Comentoring Program to
   Enhance Workplace Implementation After an Occupational Therapy Course on
   Autism Spectrum Disorders},

Abstract = {Introduction: Research suggests that learning gained through training is
   infrequently implemented in the workplace. A short-term postcourse
   comentoring program was developed with the aim of facilitating workplace
   implementation of learning after a 3-day course for occupational
   therapists. The program was evaluated for usefulness, successes,
   challenges, recommended improvements, and associations with changes in
   self-rated knowledge and confidence.
   Method: Two months after the course, 42 participants completed an
   evaluation of the comentoring program with closed-and open-ended
   questions addressing usefulness, successes, challenges, pairing
   preferences, and recommendations. They also completed a record on
   whether or not they had worked on goals nominated in their comentoring
   contract. Before and 2 months after the course, they completed a
   self-rated questionnaire on knowledge and confidence.
   Results: The comentoring program was recommended by 80\% of
   participants. Benefits included opportunities for information and
   resource sharing, debriefing, problem solving, reassurance, and
   implementation of ideas. Ninety-five percent of participants worked on
   some or all their comentoring goals. Although there were significant
   improvements in knowledge (P < 0.001) and confidence (P < 0.001), the
   total comentoring evaluation score was not significantly associated with
   these changes. It is therefore possible that these improvements related
   to the course itself rather than the comentoring program. Challenges
   related to time, scheduling, distance, and pairing of comentors.
   Conclusion: Reported benefits of the program included enhanced
   psychosocial support and prompting to trial newly learned strategies.
   Effectiveness may be improved by setting aside time for comentoring in
   the workplace and better matching of comentors.},

Title = {The effectiveness of the virtual patient-based social learning approach
   in undergraduate nursing education: A quasi-experimental study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {108},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: In nursing education, knowledge and competence in conducting
   physical assessments are crucial. Therefore, physical assessment
   knowledge has become a fundamental and essential education program for
   nursing students. However, most of the current nursing courses are
   taught via a didactic teaching approach, making it difficult for
   students to think deeply about relevant issues due to the lack of
   interaction and context. This may, in turn, have an impact on learning
   effectiveness and clinical judgment. Objective: A virtual patient
   (VP)-based social learning approach is proposed to enhance nursing
   students' performance and clinical judgment in education programs.
   Design: A quasi-experiment method was adopted to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach. Participants: A total of 40
   senior nursing students participated in the study (VP-based social
   learning approach group = 20, control group = 20). Methods: The study
   involved a pre- and post-test to examine students' learning
   achievements, self-efficacy, and communication skills. The experimental
   group adopted the VP-based learning approach, while the control group
   adopted the conventional didactic learning approach. ANCOVA was employed
   to compare the performances of the two groups. Results: The experimental
   results indicate that using a VP for learning can enhance students'
   learning achievements, self-efficacy, and communication skills. In
   addition, based on the analysis of the results, students generally
   believed that learning with a VP makes learning more enjoyable.
   Conclusion: The VP-based social learning approach would be an effective
   strategy to train nursing students who have limited opportunities to
   experience real clinical situations, in particular during the COVID-19
   pandemic.},

Abstract = {Background Developing self-directed learning (SDL) skills in engineering
   students is critical to support life-long learning. This research was
   conducted at Iron Range Engineering (IRE), an innovative, problem-based
   learning (PBL) engineering program, which has suffused the concept of
   metacognition throughout its curriculum. Purpose/Hypotheses Using
   measures of metacognition obtained from think-aloud problem-solving
   activities, to what extent do students change their use of SDL
   strategies from the beginning of their junior year to the end of their
   senior year of the 2-year PBL engineering program? Using evidence
   obtained from interview data, how do students' conceptualizations of
   metacognition and use of SDL strategies change from the beginning of
   their junior year to the end of their senior year of the 2-year PBL
   engineering program? What is the relationship between think-aloud and
   interview measures of metacognition, and how could the two types of
   measures better inform us about the potential impact of the IRE program
   on students' use of SDL strategies? Design/Method Twelve students
   participated in both think-aloud problem-solving tasks and interviews.
   Results Data from think-aloud problem-solving activities showed that
   nearly one-half of students' verbalizations were metacognitive and that
   they talked more about strategies and made more use of domain knowledge
   by the end of their program. Interview data showed that one-half of the
   students showed an increase in the complexity of their understanding of
   SDL. Conclusions Our data show an increased use of strategies during
   problem-solving at the end of the program. The results are promising,
   but further research is needed to understand the development of SDL in
   engineering students.},

Title = {Applying the Computing Professional Skills Assessment Method to ESL

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Professional skills, also known as non-technical, transferable or 21st
   century skills are recognized worldwide as very important for university
   graduates. These skills include communication, problem-solving and the
   ability to function successfully on a multi-disciplinary team. While
   academic programs worldwide strive to develop a solid professional
   skills base in students, these skills are notoriously challenging to
   teach and assess. This paper presents the Computing Professional Skills
   Assessment (CPSA), a performance assessment of the professional skills
   learning outcomes identified by the Accreditation Board for Engineering
   and Technology (ABET), for the computing discipline. The assessment
   consists of a performance task, a rubric and an implementation method.
   The CPSA has been developed in an iterative manner and results suggest
   that it can accurately and consistently elicit and measure the targeted
   professional skills in computing students within appropriate contexts.
   Considering two components of the Communities of Inquiry model,
   cognitive and social presence, specific reliability and validity
   protocols were developed for the CPSA. These involved a pilot study,
   iterative development and assessment of the rubric, establishment of
   interrater reliability, the production of computing specific scenarios
   which are suitable for non-native English language speakers, and an
   implementation strategy using asynchronous discussion boards. Based on
   our findings through more than 50 CPSA implementations over a sevenyear
   period, we have found that the instrument can be used reliably and
   validly as a measure of the professional skills learning outcomes for
   English as a second language learners in a computing program.},

Abstract = {Didactic lessons are only one part of the multimodal teaching strategies
   used in gross anatomy courses today. Increased emphasis is placed on
   providing more opportunities for students to develop lifelong learning
   and critical thinking skills during medical training. In a pilot program
   designed to promote more engaged and independent learning in anatomy,
   self-study modules were introduced to supplement human gross anatomy
   instruction at Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine at Marshall
   University. Modules use three-dimensional constructs to help students
   understand complex anatomical regions. Resources are self-contained in
   portable bins and are accessible at any time. Students use modules
   individually or in groups in a structured self-study format that
   augments material presented in lecture and laboratory. Pilot outcome
   data, measured by feedback surveys and examination performance
   statistics, suggest that the activity may be improving learning in gross
   anatomy. Positive feedback on both pre- and post-examination surveys
   showed that students felt the activity helped to increase their
   understanding of the topic. In concordance with student perception,
   average examination scores on module-related laboratory and lecture
   questions were higher in the two years of the pilot program compared
   with the year before its initiation. Modules can be fabricated on a
   modest budget using minimal resources, making implementation practical
   for smaller institutions. Upper level medical students assist in module
   design and upkeep, enabling continuous opportunities for vertical
   integration across the curriculum. This resource offers a feasible
   mechanism for enhancing independent and lifelong learning competencies,
   which could be a valuable complement to any gross anatomy curriculum.

Abstract = {The potent combination of a global pandemic, crises involving human and
   civil rights, economic shortfalls, and public policy challenges has
   import for the field of physical education. The time has arrived for
   physical education professionals to engage in planning for a more
   desirable future. One aim of this paper is to provide a theoretical
   analysis of systems thinking and planning dynamics, which focus on
   whole-part relationships because changes in one component in the
   physical education system influence and are influenced by others. These
   systems dynamics recommend a dual strategy: (a) collective action
   focused on malleable systems components (e.g., teacher education, school
   programs); and (b) a long-term plan launched with short-term, achievable
   goals that enable ``small wins{''} in one part of the system on the way
   to big systems change gains. A second aim to this analysis is to
   consider how professional learning communities (PLCs) provide a
   collective action strategy for improvements in school programs, some of
   which qualify as ``small wins{''} with the potential for big, systems
   changes. This potential for PLCs is explored in the ensuing theoretical
   paper (Part II), which concludes with practical suggestions, while
   inviting companion research and development initiatives with the
   potential for systems improvements.},

Title = {Student-Valued Measurable Teaching Behaviors of Award-Winning Pharmacy
   Preceptors},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {79},
Number = {10},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objective. To identify specific preceptor teaching-coaching, role
   modeling, and facilitating behaviors valued by pharmacy students and to
   develop measures of those behaviors that can be used for an experiential
   education quality assurance program.
   Methods. Using a qualitative research approach, we conducted a thematic
   analysis of student comments about excellent preceptors to identify
   behaviors exhibited by those preceptors. Identified behaviors were
   sorted according to the preceptor's role as role model, teacher/coach,
   or learning facilitator; measurable descriptors for each behavior were
   then developed.
   Results. Data analysis resulted in identification of 15 measurable
   behavior themes, the most frequent being: having an interest in student
   learning and success, making time for students, and displaying a
   positive preceptor attitude. Measureable descriptors were developed for
   5 role-modeling behaviors, 6 teaching-coaching behaviors, and 4
   facilitating behaviors.
   Conclusion. Preceptors may need to be evaluated in their separate roles
   as teacher-coach, role model, and learning facilitator. The developed
   measures in this report could be used in site quality evaluation.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We investigate conditions in which novices make some reference errors
   when programming. We asked students from introductory programming
   courses to perform a simple code-writing task that required constructing
   references to objects and their attributes. By experimentally
   manipulating the nature of the attributes in the tasks, from identifying
   attributes (e.g., title or label) to descriptive attributes (e.g.,
   calories or texture), the study revealed the relative frequencies with
   which students mistakenly omit the name of an identifying attribute
   while attempting to reference its value. We explain how these
   reference-point shifts are consistent with the use of metonymy, a form
   of figurative expression in human communication. Our analysis also
   reveals how the presentation of examples can affect the construction of
   the reference in the student's solution. We discuss plausible accounts
   of the reference-point errors and how they may inform a model of
   reference construction. We suggest that reference-point errors may be
   the result of well-practiced habits of communication rather than
   misconceptions of the task or what the computer can do.},

Title = {Mento's change model in teaching competency-based medical education},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 27},
Abstract = {Background Resistance to change is customary and is expected in any
   organization. However, most of the downsides of change can be avoided if
   the organization/individual prepares for the change by acknowledging
   guided strategies. In healthcare, change is the state of nature, which
   has also translated to medical education (ME). ME in the current era has
   undergone a shift from a traditional content-based curriculum to a
   competency-based curriculum. Recently, however, the broader
   social-accountability movement has accelerated this rate of
   transformation. One of the key challenges to educators harbingering this
   transformation to competency-based medical education (CBME) is to
   redesign the processes of teaching. Aim Here we define a framework
   designed using Mento's model of change that will totally agree with
   introducing positive change in teaching in an institution undergoing
   transformation from a traditional content-based curriculum to a
   competency-based curriculum. Methodology Using Schein's ``unfreezing{''}
   as a guide term we critically reflected on the popular change-management
   models, to home in on Kotter's model of change to transform
   organizations. However, Kotter's change-model draws from Situational and
   Contingency Leadership Theories, which may not agree with academic
   organizations involved in ME. As such organizations adhere to
   Transactional and Transformational Leadership archetypes, where
   Leadership is constructively executed by ``The Leader Team{''}, we
   decided to adopt Mento's change-model for our study. Mento's model not
   only draws from the precepts of Kotter's model, but also incorporates
   axioms of Jick's and GE's change-models. Results Using Mento's model a
   framework was blueprinted to implement active learning (AL) strategies
   in CBME. Here we have elaborated on the framework using the exemplar of
   flipped teaching. The development of this framework required the design
   and execution of a faculty development program, and a step by step
   guidance plan to chaperon, instruct and implement change in teaching to
   harbinger CBME. Further, we have also reflected on the change process
   using Gravin's framework. Conclusion To our knowledge this is the first
   report of the use of Mento's model of change in medical education. Also,
   the blueprinted framework is supported by acknowledged leadership
   theories and can be translated to implement any curricular change in
   CBME.},

Abstract = {Many undergraduates who wish to pursue degrees in science, particularly
   students from underrepresented groups, drop out of science majors before
   realizing their goal. This study examines the effectiveness of a
   mentoring program - called Biomentors - aimed at promoting success in
   biology courses for undergraduates beginning their coursework toward a
   bachelor's degree in the biological sciences. Students enrolled in the
   Biomentors program met twice a week in a small group with an advanced
   biology major under the supervision of a faculty member to explore
   effective learning strategies for success in an introductory-level
   biology course they were taking. Students who participated in the
   Biomentors program scored significantly higher (based on total points
   earned) than other students enrolled in the course across two cohorts (d
   = 0.36 in the fall quarter of 2014; d = 0.34 in the winter quarter of
   2015). The biomentors group significantly outscored the control group
   even when the effects of gender, parent income level, parent education
   level, total SAT score, and cumulative GPA were statistically controlled
   using a stepwise regression. Overall, the results encourage further
   investigation of the effectiveness of peer-mentoring programs that
   emphasize domain-specific learning strategies for college students
   beginning as science majors.},

Abstract = {{[}This paper is part of the Focused Collection on Curriculum
   Development: Theory into Design.] We argue that teaching learning
   sequence (TLS) design needs to be further developed through the explicit
   articulation of methodology, which comprises the theoretical commitments
   regarding research and how those give rise to methods for design,
   implementation and assessment. In this study we propose design based
   research (DBR) as a methodology to conduct systematic and iterative
   studies of the design and assessment of educational interventions (such
   as materials and strategies) as solutions to complex problems in
   educational practice. This methodology does not specify theoretical
   commitments regarding the nature of learning and how those give rise to
   teaching strategies, but the articulation of those commitments is
   expected as part of the justification for decision making in the design
   process. In order to demonstrate the framework, we present an example of
   TLS development in the context of introductory electrostatics and dc
   circuits. We describe the evaluation of the TLS over three years of
   implementation, addressing both the capacity of the TLS for involving
   students in learning the topic and the students' learning itself.},

Abstract = {This study aims to advocate that a visual programming environment
   offering graphical items and states of a computational problem could be
   helpful in supporting programming learning with computational
   problem-solving. A visual problem-solving environment for programming
   learning was developed, and 158 college students were conducted in a
   computational problem-solving activity. The students' activities of
   designing, composing, and testing solutions were recorded by log data
   for later analysis. To initially unveil the students' practice and
   strategies exhibited in the visual problem-solving environment, this
   study proposed several indicators to quantitatively represent students'
   computational practice (Sequence, Selection, Simple iteration, Nested
   iteration, and Testing), computational design (Problem decomposition,
   Abutment composition, and Nesting composition), and computational
   performance (Goal attainment and Program size). By the method of cluster
   analysis, some empirical patterns regarding the students' programming
   learning with computational problem-solving were identified.
   Furthermore, comparisons of computational design and computational
   performance among the different patterns of computational practice were
   conducted. Considering the relations of students' computational practice
   to computational design and performance, evidence-based suggestions on
   the design of supportive programming environments for novice programmers
   are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {While many studies describe the use of technology in the mathematics
   classroom, few explore the factors that influence teacher decisions
   around its use. The participants in this study were 21 early career
   secondary mathematics teachers who had completed an undergraduate
   mathematics teacher preparation program in the USA with a strong
   emphasis on the use of technology to teach mathematics. In this
   qualitative study, interview data were collected and analyzed with
   attention toward why teachers choose to use technology to teach
   mathematics, what tools they chose to use and why, as well as the
   general factors they consider when selecting particular technology
   tools. Findings indicate that one of the most important factors when
   deciding whether to use technology was how well it aligned with the
   goals of a lesson. The range of technology used spanned mathematical
   action tools, collaboration tools, assessment tools, and communication
   tools. When selecting particular tools teachers most heavily considered
   ease of use for both themselves and their students. These findings
   suggest that when considering how to infuse technology into teacher
   education programs we suggest that it is important to focus more broadly
   on types of tools, ways teachers can position them, and how particular
   activities align with specific mathematics learning objectives.},

Abstract = {SEED is a software tool designed for Java consisting of a class library
   and a set of simulators to facilitate learning of the main data
   structures. The educational component is based on an active case-solving
   methodology accompanied by a pedagogical strategy. This strategy allows
   for the development of a multilayer-model-programming work for the
   construction of basic and advanced applications in real domains and for
   integration of its use, development and operation assessment with data
   structures. The evaluation results of SEED as a pedagogical mediator in
   the issue of binary trees is presented. The evaluation indicates that
   students prefer to use SEED due to its simplicity and attractive GUIs
   which facilitate data structures learning.},

Abstract = {This work describes the implementation of a hierarchical team model, the
   Integrated Peer Leadership Program (IPLP), in a calculus-based college
   introductory physics classroom. Using this model, in which students in
   the course engage with their peers throughout the semester, we observe a
   significant increase in the students' likelihood of successfully
   completing the course. The model also reduces the gap between
   underrepresented minority (URM) and non-URM students. Learning gains
   using the IPLP format are improved as compared to previous data for
   traditional classes. The model transforms a traditional lecture style
   class into a student-centered class without additional time requirement
   or cost to the instructor or institution, and we anticipate that it will
   be portable to other large section introductory college science courses.},

Abstract = {The 2017 reform of the Swedish national curriculum requires that all
   compulsory school mathematics and technology teachers integrate
   programming into their teaching. The new programming policy poses a
   particular challenge since a majority of the affected teachers have
   little or no previous programming experience. This paper reports on a
   study of teachers preparing to implement the new policy. Insight into
   the preparation process was made possible through recorded group
   conversations and data were collected in March 2018, less than 4 months
   before the formal enactment of the new curriculum. The results,
   conceptualised by using a framework for intrinsic and extrinsic
   challenges, reveal several challenges that can potentially affect the
   uptake of the programming policy and the quality of implementation such
   as uncertainty about the subject content, unequal professional
   development opportunities, lack of teaching materials and recurring
   problems with school IT infrastructure. This study seeks to provide
   knowledge about teachers' concerns and expressed needs while negotiating
   programming as new curriculum content and thus aims to contribute to the
   understanding of teachers' strategies to approach the 2017 Swedish
   educational reform that introduces programming. Such knowledge is
   valuable for the possibilities to better understand under what
   circumstances programming is included in school mathematics and
   technology. The results illustrate the complexity of curriculum reform
   implementation and may be of value for decision makers at all levels of
   school policy and also for providers of both in-service and preservice
   teacher training.},

Abstract = {Background: E-learning is a flexible strategy to improve nurses'
   knowledge of case management, but there are methodological limitations
   in previous research into the effectiveness of such programs.
   Purpose: To describe the development and effectiveness of an
   evidence-integrated e-learning program in case management continuing
   education for Taiwanese psychiatric nurses.
   Design: Multiple methods were adopted to develop the program and a
   randomised controlled trial with repeated measures was employed to
   evaluate it
   Methods: The e-learning program was developed in four stages: (1)
   systematic review of literature; (2) needs assessment through a national
   survey and focus group; (3) development of learning materials; and (4)
   pilot test. Following program development, psychiatric nurses were
   recruited and randomly allocated into an experimental or comparison
   group. The experimental group participated in an e-learning continuing
   education program. The case management knowledge index with sufficient
   reliability and validity and a satisfaction survey were used to
   determine the outcomes. A generalised estimating equation was used to
   assess the difference between the 2 groups before, after, and at 3
   months follow-up.
   Results: The learning material comprised 5 simulated learning modules,
   self-assessment questions, learning cases, sharing experiences, and
   learning resources. A total of 200 participants completed the 3
   measurements. Knowledge scores in the experimental group significantly
   exceeded those in the comparison group after the program and at the
   3-month follow-up. Participants reported positive learning perceptions.
   Conclusion: The program provides an evidence-based educational resource
   for nursing continuing education in case management. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {This paper describes the change in software design strategies used by
   novice programmers over the course of one semester by using verbal
   protocol analysis. Our participants were nine first-year undergraduate
   students (novices), and two experts. Overall, we observed that two types
   of strategy were used by the novice programmers. The most common
   strategy observed in our participants, at the beginning of the semester,
   was a UI-based strategy that focused on system components from the
   user's perspective. This strategy is often overly simplified with little
   operational and technical details. Another type of strategy used by
   novices later in the study was a functional-centered strategy in which
   novices incorporated programming concepts into their design. Novices who
   used the latter strategy were able to provide more operational detail
   than when the UI-based strategy was used. We also found that, due to
   lack of experience, the designs were still very preliminary. In
   addition, the novices also exhibited opportunistic design behavior more
   often than systematic behavior (i.e., a top-down or bottom-up strategy)
   during the semester. We argue that teaching programming knowledge and
   skills alone will not develop students' software design knowledge
   effectively.},

Abstract = {The energy management of the hybrid electric vehicle is still the
   research hotspot. In order to improve the fuel economy of the parallel
   hybrid electric vehicle, a new energy management design method based on
   the kernel fuzzy C clustering (KFCM) for multi neural network (MNN) is
   proposed. The global optimal solution is obtained by the dynamic
   programming global optimization off-line simulation, and the KFCM
   algorithm is used to cluster the global optimal data set according to
   the vehicle running mode, and the neural network is established for each
   cluster. The MNN model structure after training is used as the output of
   the energy management strategy to realize the real-time optimal
   allocation of engine and motor torque according to the real-time
   condition. The simulation results show that the energy management
   strategy based on KFCM-MNN has good learning simulation ability for
   dynamic planning energy management strategy, and it is a quasi-optimal
   control strategy.},

Abstract = {Multimedia and simulation programs are increasingly being used for
   anatomy instruction, yet it remains unclear how learning with these
   technologies compares with learning with actual human cadavers. Using a
   multilevel, quasi-experimental-control design, this study compared the
   effects of ``Anatomy and Physiology Revealed{''} (APR) multimedia
   learning system with a traditional undergraduate human cadaver
   laboratory. APR is a model-based multimedia simulation tool that uses
   high-resolution pictures to construct a prosected cadaver. APR also
   provides animations showing the function of specific anatomical
   structures. Results showed that the human cadaver laboratory offered a
   significant advantage over the multimedia simulation program on
   cadaver-based measures of identification and explanatory knowledge.
   These findings reinforce concerns that incorporating multimedia
   simulation into anatomy instruction requires careful alignment between
   learning tasks and performance measures. Findings also imply that
   additional pedagogical strategies are needed to support transfer from
   simulated to real-world application of anatomical knowledge. Anat Sci

Title = {Assessing the Impact of Continuous Evaluation Strategies: Tradeoff

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {59},

Abstract = {Current opinion on undergraduate studies has led to a reformulation of
   teaching methodologies to base them not just on learning, but also on
   skills and competencies. In this approach, the teaching/learning process
   should accomplish both knowledge assimilation and skill development.
   Previous works demonstrated that a strategy that uses continuous
   evaluation is able to meet both objectives. However, those studies did
   not evaluate and quantify the additional effort required to implement
   such strategies. This paper evaluates the additional instructor effort
   required when implementing continuous evaluation in a first-year
   Computer Fundamentals course in the Computer Engineering degree program
   at the Technical University of Valencia, Spain. The experiment
   quantifies how instructor workload increases under different continuous
   evaluation strategies and how this affects the overall student grade.
   Both the ``standard{''} continuous evaluation method and the intensive
   continuous evaluation method are analyzed, the latter being a proposal
   that builds upon the standard method by increasing the number of tests
   and examinations. The results obtained reveal that continuous evaluation
   improves student grades but that intensive continuous evaluation is
   liable to generate an excessive instructor overload without having a
   significant impact on student scores.},

Title = {Software quality assessment using a multi-strategy classifier},
Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {259},
Pages = {555-570},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {Classifying program Modules as fault-prone or not fault-prone is a
   valuable technique for guiding the software development process, so that
   resources can be allocated to components most likely to have faults. The
   rule-based classification and the case-based learning techniques are
   commonly used in software quality classification problems. However,
   studies show that these two techniques share some complementary
   strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new
   multi-strategy classification model, RB2CBL, which integrates a
   rule-based (RB) model with two case-based learning (CBL) models. RB2CBL
   possesses the merits of both the RB model and CBL model and restrains
   their drawbacks. In the RB2CBL model, the parameter optimization of the
   CBL models is critical and an embedded genetic algorithm optimizer is
   used. Two case studies were carried out to validate the proposed method.
   The results show that, by suitably choosing the accuracy of the RB
   model, the RB2CBL model outperforms the RB model alone without

Title = {Indigenous health: designing a clinical orientation program valued by
   learners},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {OCT 5},
Abstract = {Background: Indigenous health programs are seen as a curriculum response
   to addressing health disparities and social accountability. Several
   interrelated teaching approaches to cultural competency curricula have
   been recommended, however evidence of the impact of these on learner
   outcomes including engagement and self-reported competencies is limited.
   We aimed to explore undergraduate medical student perspectives of an
   indigenous health orientation program to inform curriculum strategies
   that promote learning and development of clinical skills.
   Methods: We analyzed quantitative and qualitative student evaluations (n
   = 602) of a three-day immersed indigenous health orientation program
   between 2006 and 2014 based on Likert-scale responses and open-text
   comments. We conducted a thematic analysis of narrative student
   experiences (n = 426).
   Results: Overall, 509 of 551 respondents (92\%) rated the indigenous
   health orientation program as extremely or highly valuable and most
   (87\%) reported that the course strongly increased their interest in
   indigenous health. The features of the clinical course that enhanced
   value for learners included situated learning (learning environment;
   learning context); teaching qualities (enthusiasm and passion for Maori
   health; role-modelling); curriculum content (re-presenting Maori
   history; exploring Maori beliefs, values and practices; using a Maori
   health framework in clinical practice); teaching methodologies (multiple
   teaching methods; simulated patient interview); and building
   relationships with peers (getting to know the student cohort; developing
   professional working relationships).
   Conclusions: Undergraduate medical students valued an indigenous health
   program delivered in an authentic indigenous environment and that
   explicitly reframed historical notions of indigenous health to
   contextualize learning. Content relevant to clinical practice, faculty
   knowledge, and strengthened peer interactions combined to build learner
   confidence and self-reported indigenous health competencies. These
   findings suggest empirical evidence to support a curriculum approach to
   indigenous health teaching that enhances clinical learning.},

Title = {How clinical teaching teams deal with educational change: `we just do
   it'},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 17},
Abstract = {Background In postgraduate medical education, program directors are in
   the lead of educational change within clinical teaching teams. As change
   is part of a social process, it is important to not only focus on the
   program director but take their other team members into account. The
   purpose of this study is to provide an in-depth insight into how
   clinical teaching teams manage and organize curriculum change processes,
   and implement curriculum change in daily practice. Methods An
   explorative qualitative semi-structured interview study was conducted
   between October 2016 and March 2017. A total of six clinical teaching
   teams (n = 6) participated in this study, i.e. one program director, one
   clinical staff member, and one trainee from each clinical teaching team
   (n = 18). Data were analysed and structured by means of thematic
   analysis. Results The analysis yielded to five factors that positively
   impact change: shared commitment, reinvention, ownership, supportive
   structure and open culture. Factors that negatively impact change were:
   resistance, behaviour change, balance between different tasks, lack of
   involvement, lack of consensus, and unsafe culture and hierarchy.
   Overall, no clear change strategy could be recognized. Conclusions
   Insight was gathered in factors facilitating and hindering the
   implementation of change. It seems particularly important for clinical
   teaching teams to be able to create a sense of ownership among all team
   members by making a proposed change valuable for their local context as
   well as to be capable of working together as a team. Cultural factors
   seem to be particularly relevant in a team's ability to accomplish this.},

Title = {Case Study: Design Strategies for Enabling Visual Application Blocks of
   Bluetooth Library},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {52630-52654},
Abstract = {Block-based tools can make it easier for beginners to learn programming
   by arranging blocks. Their block concept and extensible characteristics
   make block-based designs suitable for introductory programming. However,
   block-based tools are easy to use but difficult to extend to include the
   complicated applications of vendor libraries or domain-specific
   libraries. This paper proposes a solution to block design strategies
   that enable designers to redefine and design domain-specific libraries
   to generate visual application blocks. This research uses the Bluetooth
   library as a case study and constructs the BlocklyTooth integrated
   development environment (IDE) using the Google Blockly tool. A
   feasibility evaluation of this study produced the following findings:
   (1) for the strategies, the usability of the usability metric for user
   experience (UMUX) and the practicality of the customized theme received
   satisfactory responses; and (2) for the IDE, the usability of UMUX and
   the value implication of the customized theme received positive reviews.
   In addition, the experiment on resource impact revealed that the
   strategies are effective in improving resource utilization, in which the
   quantity of code is reduced by 70.2\% and 89\% in terms of the block
   count and lines of code, respectively, and the system memory is reduced
   by 51.8\% in terms of the dynamic code size. The results indicate that
   the proposed solution can be a design reference guideline for
   block-based tools and can effectively abstract the complex Bluetooth
   library into blocks.},

Abstract = {Don Hellison presented his ideas to teachers and coaches who sought
   strategies for enhancing responsibility behaviors in youth of
   underserved communities. He also conveyed his concepts to teacher
   educators charged with preparing professionals in sport and physical
   activity all over the world. Using a variety of formal and informal ways
   of sharing teaching personal and social responsibility (TPSR), Don, his
   colleagues, and those responsible for educating teachers and coaches
   have shared TPSR as a way to help youth learn social and emotional life
   skills through sport and physical activity. This article is designed to
   review what is known about how teachers and other physical activity
   professionals learn to do TPSR by exploring the literature and research
   as well as summarizing lessons learned about the process. Common
   barriers to successful implementation of TPSR and future directions for
   research and practice on professional development in TPSR are discussed.},

Title = {Interpretable Multiview Early Warning System Adapted to Underrepresented

Abstract = {Early warning systems have been progressively implemented in higher
   education institutions to predict student performance. However, they
   usually fail at effectively integrating the many information sources
   available at universities to make more accurate and timely predictions,
   they often lack decision-making reasoning to motivate the reasons behind
   the predictions, and they are generally biased toward the general
   student body, ignoring the idiosyncrasies of underrepresented student
   populations (determined by socio-demographic factors such as race,
   gender, residency, or status as a freshmen, transfer, adult, or
   first-generation students) that traditionally have greater difficulties
   and performance gaps. This paper presents a multiview early warning
   system built with comprehensible Genetic Programming classification
   rules adapted to specifically target underrepresented and
   underperforming student populations. The system integrates many student
   information repositories using multiview learning to improve the
   accuracy and timing of the predictions. Three interfaces have been
   developed to provide personalized and aggregated comprehensible feedback
   to students, instructors, and staff to facilitate early intervention and
   student support. Experimental results, validated with statistical
   analysis, indicate that this multiview learning approach outperforms
   traditional classifiers. Learning outcomes will help instructors and
   policy-makers to deploy strategies to increase retention and improve
   academics.},

Abstract = {Background: the aim of this article was to obtain the opinions of a
   pharmacist teachers group regarding the pharmaceutical care course model
   most suited to Brazil. Methods: five teachers of pharmaceutical care
   courses in public Faculty of Pharmacy in Brazil were selected to
   participate. Participants were asked to provide their perceptions about
   3 predetermined questions regarding the content that should be taught in
   pharmaceutical care course, skills that should be taught in the course,
   and learning activities that are necessary to develop the knowledge and
   skills that are taught. Data were subjected to a content analysis.
   Results: the focus group identified 5 categories related to the
   students' development of professional identity: competences to
   pharmaceutical care; challenges to teach; instructional design; learning
   assessment; and barriers to the application of the teaching method.
   Conclusion: the report of this focus group shows that new teaching
   methods should be implemented to ensure effective pharmaceutical care
   courses.},

Abstract = {As of late, with the progression of AI and man-made brainpower, there
   has been a developing spotlight on versatile e-learning. As all ways to
   deal with e-learning lose their allure and the level of online courses
   builds, they move towards more customized versatile learning so as to
   collaborate with students and achieve better learning results. The
   schools focus on the examination, mindfulness, and arranging techniques
   that infuse innovation into the vision and educational program.
   E-learning issues are a standard examination issue for us all. The
   motivation behind this research analysis is to separate the potential
   outcomes of assessing e-learning models utilizing AI strategies such as
   Supervised, Semi Supervised, Reinforced Learning advances by
   investigating upsides and downsides of various methods organization. The
   literature review methodology is to review the cross sectional impacts
   of e-learning and Machine learning algorithms from existing literatures
   from the year 1993 to 2020 and to assess the essentialness of e-learning
   features to optimize the e-learning models with available Machine
   learning techniques from peer-inspected journals, capable destinations,
   and books. Second, it legitimizes the chances of e-learning structures
   introduction, and changes demonstrated through AI and Machine Learning
   algorithms. This examination assists in providing helpful new highlights
   to analysts, researchers and academicians. It gives an exhaustive
   structure of existing e-learning frameworks for the most recent
   innovations identified with learning framework capacities and learning
   tasks to envision ML research openings in appropriate spaces. The survey
   paper identifies and demonstrates the important role of different types
   of e-learning features such as Individual pertinent feature, Course
   pertinent feature, Context pertinent feature and Technology pertinent
   feature in framework performance tuning. The performance of Machine
   Learning algorithms to optimize the features of E-Learning models were
   reviewed in previous literatures and Support Vector Machine technique
   was found to be the one of the best to predict the input and output
   parameters of e-learning models and it is found that Fuzzy C Means, Deep
   Learning algorithms are producing better results for Big Data sets.},

Abstract = {Community-based physical activity programs for people with disabilities
   have barriers that are unique to their program leader qualifications and
   the population they serve. Moran and Block (2010) argued that there is a
   need for practical strategies that are easy for communities to
   implement, maximize resources, and minimize the impact of barriers on
   each individual. The purpose of this article was to build upon the work
   of Moran and Block by identifying and systematically addressing barriers
   to physical activity for people with disabilities in ways that target
   their sources of self-efficacy. The Empowerment Model is introduced,
   along with its multi-tiered empowerment continuum of training, support,
   and programming strands. The goal of the tiered empowerment continuum is
   to progressively move populations to more independent levels of
   training, support, and programming.},

Title = {The role of national cybersecurity strategies on the improvement of cyb

Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {119},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Digital information and telecommunication technologies have not only
   become essential to individuals' daily lives but also to a nation's
   sustained economic growth, societal well-being, critical infrastructure
   resilience, and national security. Consequently, the protection of a
   nation's cyber sovereignty from malicious acts is a major concern. This
   signifies the importance of cybersecurity education in facilitating the
   creation of a resilient cybersecurity ecosystem and in supporting cyber
   sovereignty. This study reviews a sample from world-leading countries
   National Cybersecurity Strategic Plans (NCSPs) and analyzes the
   associated existing cybersecurity education and training improvement
   initiatives. Furthermore, a proposal to adopt the
   Goal-Question-Outcomes(GQO)+Strategies paradigm into cybersecurity
   education and training programs curricula improvement to national
   cybersecurity strategic goals is presented. The proposal maps
   cybersecurity strategic goals to cybersecurity skills and competencies
   using the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE)
   framework. The newly proposed cybersecurity education and training
   programs' curricula learning outcomes were generated from the
   GQO+Strategies paradigm based on the three major cybersecurity strategic
   goals: Development of secure digital and information technology
   infrastructure and services, defending from sophisticated cyber threats,
   and enrichment of individuals' cybersecurity maturity and awareness. It
   is highly recommended that cybersecurity university program
   administrators utilize the proposed GQO+Strategies to align their
   program's curriculum to NCSP. Hence, closing the gap that exists with
   the relevant skills and sustain national cybersecurity workforces. (c)

Abstract = {Energy management strategy is critical in the development of hybrid
   electric vehicles. It is used to improve fuel economy and sustain
   battery state of charge by splitting the power demand to different power
   sources while satisfying various physical constraints and vehicle
   performance simultaneously. However, it is challenging to achieve an
   optimal control performance due to the complexity of the hybrid
   powertrain, the time-varying constraints, and stochastic of the load
   power. Focusing on these problems, this paper presents an online
   correction predictive energy management (OCPEM) strategy for a hybrid
   electric tracked vehicle based on dynamic programming (DP) and
   reinforcement learning (RL). First, a multi-time-scale prediction method
   is proposed to realize the short-period future driving cycle prediction.
   Then, the DP algorithm is applied to obtain the local control policy
   based on the short-period future driving cycle. The RL algorithm is
   combined with the fuzzy logic controller to optimize the control policy
   by eliminating the influence of imprecise prediction. Finally, the
   simulations are conducted in Matlab/Simulink to evaluate the control
   effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed method. The results
   indicate that the fuel economy of the proposed OCPEM is improved by 4\%
   compared with the original predictive energy management and achieve
   90.51\% of that of the DP benchmark.},

Title = {Towards healthy learning climates in postgraduate medical education:
   exploring the role of hospital-wide education committees},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {DEC 6},
Abstract = {Background: Postgraduate medical education prepares residents for
   delivery of high quality patient care during training as well as for
   later practice, which makes high quality residency training programs
   crucial to safeguard patient care. Healthy learning climates contribute
   to high quality postgraduate medical education. In several countries,
   modernization of postgraduate medical education has resulted in
   hospital-wide responsibilities for monitoring learning climates. This
   study investigates the association between the actions undertaken by
   hospital-wide education committees and learning climates in postgraduate
   medical education.
   Methods: Research conducted in December 2010 invited 57 chairs of
   hospital-wide education committees to complete a questionnaire on their
   implemented level of quality improvement policies. We merged the survey
   data from 21 committees that oversaw training programs and used the
   Dutch Residency Educational Climate Test (D-RECT) instrument in 2012 to
   measure their training programs' learning climate. We used descriptive
   statistics and linear mixed models to analyse associations between the
   functioning of hospital-wide education committees and corresponding
   learning climates.
   Results: In total, 812 resident evaluations for 99 training programs in
   21 teaching hospitals were available for analysis. The implementation
   level of the internal quality management systems as adopted by the
   hospital-wide education committees varied from 1.6 to 2.6 on a 5 point
   Likert-scale (ranging from 1 (worst) to 5 (best)). No significant
   associations were found between the functioning of the committees and
   corresponding learning climates.
   Conclusions: The contribution of hospital-wide committees to creating
   healthy learning climates is yet to be demonstrated. The absence of such
   an association could be due to the lack of a Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle
   guiding the policy as implemented by the committees and the lack of
   involvement of departmental leadership. Insight into the impact of these
   strategies on learning climates will benefit the quality of postgraduate
   medical education and, hopefully, patient care.},

Title = {Unintentional Islanding Transition Control Strategy for
   Three-/Single-Phase Multimicrogrids Based on Artificial Emotional
   Reinforcement Learning},

Abstract = {Distribution network failures can cause unintentional islanding of
   three-/single-phase multimicrogrids (MMGs). The transient impulse that
   occurs during the unintentional islanding period can affect the
   stability of the voltage and frequency in an MMG. To address this
   problem, this article proposes an unintentional islanding transition
   control strategy based on artificial emotional reinforcement learning
   (AERL) for a three-/single-phase MMG. First, to solve the three-phase
   unbalance problem that occurs during the unintentional islanding period,
   a three-phase combination method based on a merge sort is proposed to
   realize the combination optimization of the single-phase
   source-load-storage. Second, a load-shedding strategy based on AERL is
   proposed to deal with the tie-line power shortage caused by the
   distribution network failures. This strategy can quickly eliminate power
   shortages and ensure the uninterrupted power supply of critical loads.
   Finally, the performance of the proposed transition strategy is verified
   in a three-/single-phase MMG model based on a modified IEEE 37-bus
   system and a modified IEEE 118-bus system. During the unintentional
   islanding period, the proposed transition strategy reduces the frequency
   recovery time by 21.74\%, 14.29\%, and 10\%, the voltage recovery time
   by 16.22\%, 13.89\%, and 8.82\% compared with the mixed-integer
   second-order cone programming method (MISOCPM), the implicit enumeration
   method (IEM), and the compound storage-regulating and load-shedding
   method (CSLM) in the modified IEEE 37-bus system, respectively; the
   proposed transition strategy reduces the frequency recovery time by
   25.64\%, 21.62\%, and 12.12\%, the voltage recovery time by 19.15\%,
   15.56\%, and 7.32\% compared with the MISOCPM, IEM, and CSLM in the
   modified IEEE 118-bus system, respectively. The test results show that
   the proposed transition control strategy realizes the seamless
   transition of a three-/single-phase MMG and ensures the uninterrupted
   power supply of critical loads.},

Title = {Strategy to Develop a Common Simulation Training Program: Illustration
   with Anesthesia and Intensive Care Residency in France},
Journal = {TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 22},
Abstract = {Phenomenon: The urgency of having fair and trustworthy competency-based
   assessment in medical training is growing. Simulation is increasingly
   recognized as a potent method for building and assessing applied
   competencies. The growing use of simulation and its application in
   summative assessment calls for comprehensive and rigorously designed
   programs. Defining the current baseline of what is available and
   feasible is a crucial first step. This paper uses anesthesia and
   intensive care (AIC) in France as a case study in how to document this
   baseline. Approach: An IRB-approved, online anonymous closed survey was
   submitted to AIC residency program directors and AIC simulation program
   directors in France from January to February 2021. The
   researcher-developed survey consisted of 65 questions across five
   sections: centers' characteristics, curricular characteristics, courses'
   characteristics, instructors' characteristics, and simulation
   perceptions and perspectives. Findings: The participation rate was 31/31
   (100\%) with 29 centers affiliated with a university hospital. All
   centers had AIC simulation activities. Resident training was structured
   in 94\% of centers. Simulation uses were training (100\%), research and
   development (61\%), procedural or organizational testing (42\%), and
   summative assessment (13\%). Interprofessional full-scale simulation
   training existed in 90\% of centers. Procedural training on simulators
   prior to clinical patients' care was performed ``always{''} in 16\%,
   ``most often{''} in 45\%, ``sometimes{''} in 29\% and ``rarely{''} or
   ``not{''} in 10\% of centers. Simulated patients were used in 61\% of
   centers. Main themes were identified for procedural skills, full-scale
   and simulated patient simulation training. Simulation activity was
   perceived as increasing in 68\% of centers. Centers expressed a desire
   to participate in developing and using a national common AIC simulation
   program. Insights: Based on our findings in AIC, we demonstrated a
   baseline description of nationwide simulation activities. We now have a
   clearer perspective on a decentralized approach in which individual
   institutions or regional consortia conduct simulation for a discipline
   in a relatively homogeneous way, suggesting the feasibility for national
   guidelines. This approach provides useful clues for AIC and other
   disciplines to develop a comprehensive and meaningful program matching
   existing expectations and closing the identified gaps.},

Abstract = {Active learning is an instructional method in which students become
   engaged participants in the classroom through the use of in-class
   written exercises, games, problem sets, audience-response systems,
   debates, class discussions, etc. Despite evidence supporting the
   effectiveness of active learning strategies, minimal adoption of the
   technique has occurred in many professional programs. The goal of this
   study was to compare the perceptions of active learning between students
   who were exposed to active learning in the classroom (n = 116) and
   professional-level physiology faculty members (n = 9). Faculty members
   reported a heavy reliance on lectures and minimal use of educational
   games and activities, whereas students indicated that they learned best
   via the activities. A majority of faculty members (89\%) had observed
   active learning in the classroom and predicted favorable effects of the
   method on student performance and motivation. The main reported barriers
   by faculty members to the adoption of active learning were a lack of
   necessary class time, a high comfort level with traditional lectures,
   and insufficient time to develop materials. Students hypothesized
   similar obstacles for faculty members but also associated many negative
   qualities with the traditional lecturers. Despite these barriers, a
   majority of faculty members (78\%) were interested in learning more
   about the alternative teaching strategy. Both faculty members and
   students indicated that active learning should occupy portions (29\% vs.
   40\%) of face-to-face class time.},

Title = {Are learning styles useful? A new software to analyze correlations with

Journal = {COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 22},
Abstract = {Knowing student learning styles represents an effective way to design
   the most suitable methodology for our students so that performance can
   improve with less effort for both students and teachers. However, a
   methodology is usually set in teaching guides according to the previous
   academic year's information without any knowledge of our current
   audience. In this work, a new software for learning styles and grade
   analysis based on the Honey-Alonso Learning Styles Questionnaire has
   been proposed. This tool proposes the average learning style profiles of
   a given course by clustering student learning styles and analyzes the
   possible relation between grades and learning style profiles. By using
   that program, three different courses from Computer Sciences Engineering
   degrees during an academic year have been analyzed. The obtained results
   in our specific context exhibit that possible relation. This information
   could be useful to understand how students approach learning materials.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to describe an integrated pedagogical
   approach, aimed at advancing preservice teachers' learning on the use of
   technology and investigate its impact on participants' knowledge (i.e.,
   TPACK) and practice. The integrated approach juxtaposes an educational
   technology course with methods courses and field experience through
   careful instructional design. Both quantitative and qualitative data
   were collected. Quantitative data were collected through a pre-post
   administration of the Survey of Preservice Teachers' Knowledge of
   Teaching and Technology. Qualitative data were collected through
   open-ended survey responses and preservice teacher case narratives
   reporting on the design and implementation of technology-integrated
   lessons in a field placement. Finding revealed that participants
   experienced significant gains in all TPACK constructs. Further, findings
   indicated that participants applied their knowledge in practice though
   there was variability in the ways in which knowledge domains were
   represented in participants' narratives. Findings have implications for
   teacher education programs and for researchers interested in the
   development and assessment of preservice teacher knowledge of teaching
   with technology. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is an essential skill required for every
   individual in the digital era to become creative problem solvers. The
   purpose of this research is to investigate the relationships between
   computational thinking skills, the Big Five personality factors, and
   learning motivation using structural equation modeling (SEM). The
   research administered the computational thinking scale, NEO FFI scale,
   and Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire to a sample of 92
   students pursuing degrees in Computer Science and Engineering. Based on
   the result analysis, it was determined that both personality and
   learning motivation had positive and significant impacts on computation
   thinking skills. Personality had a major contribution to the prediction
   of CT, with consciousness being the most influential predictor. The
   findings of this study suggest that educators and academics should focus
   on the significance of the psychological side of CT for the improvement
   of students' CT skills.},

Title = {A parallel methodology using radial basis functions versus machine
   learning to environmental},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {63},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Parallel nonlinear models using radial kernels on local mesh support
   have been designed and implemented for application to real-world
   problems. Although this recently developed approach reduces the memory
   requirements compared with other methodologies suggested over the last
   few years, its computational cost makes parallelisation necessary,
   especially for big datasets with many instances or attributes. In this
   work, several strategies for the parallelisation of this methodology are
   proposed and compared. The MPI commu-nication protocol and the OpenMP
   application programming interface are used to implement the algorithm.
   The performance of this methodology is compared with various machine
   learning methods, with particular consideration of techniques using
   radial basis functions (RBF). Different methods are applied to model the
   daily maximum air temperature from real meteorological data collected
   from the Agroclimatic Station Network of the Phytosanitary Alert and
   Information Network of Andalusia, an autonomous community of southern
   Spain. The obtained goodness-of-fit measures illustrate the
   effectiveness of this nonlinear methodology, and its training process is
   shown to be simpler than those of other powerful machine learning
   methods.},

Title = {The Effectiveness of a Technology-Based Isometrical Transformation
   Flipped Classroom Learning Strategy in Improving Students' Higher Order
   Thinking Skills},

Abstract = {Isometric Transformation is one of the essential topics in the Malaysian
   Secondary School Mathematics Curriculum. In general, Malaysia's
   achievements in Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study
   (TIMSS) and Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) were
   found to be less encouraging, especially in the field of Geometry. This
   fact clearly implies that the mastery of Higher-Order Thinking Skills
   (HOTS) of Malaysian students is still low, especially in the topic of
   Isometric Transformation. Therefore, this study was conducted to develop
   Flipped Classroom Learning Strategy (FCLS) activities and evaluate their
   effectiveness in increasing Malaysian secondary school students' HOTS in
   Isometric Transformation. This study was conducted in two stages whereby
   the first stage involved the development of FCLS activities, while the
   second stage was run to evaluate the effectiveness of FCLS activities in
   enhancing students' HOTS for the topic of Isometric Transformation. The
   development of activities involved three phases. The first phase was the
   needs analysis phase which involved a preliminary survey towards
   students' learning difficulties at each level of HOTS in the topic of
   Isometric Transformation. The second phase was the design and
   development stage of FCLS activities, involving the learning activities
   inside and outside the classroom in line with the topic of Isometric
   Transformation. The last phase was the evaluation phase which involved
   the content validation and evaluation on the suitability of FCLS
   activities by 11 experts. Next, the second stage was a
   quasi-experimental design which involved 131 Form 2 students from two
   secondary schools in Johor. The study sample was divided into two groups
   which were the treatment group and the control group. The study was
   conducted over eight weeks. Mann-Whitney test results showed a
   significant difference (p =.000 <.05) in the overall level and also for
   all of the four levels of HOTS for both control and treatment groups.
   The results of this study showed that the teaching and learning process
   that used FCLS activities successfully created an effective learning
   situation in improving students' HOTS in the topic of Isometric
   Transformation. In conclusion, these FCLS activities should be used as
   guidelines for educators to increase HOTS in mathematics education.},

Abstract = {The general aim is to promote the use of individual-based models
   (biological agent-based models) in teaching and learning contexts in
   life sciences and to make their progressive incorporation into academic
   curricula easier, complementing other existing modelling strategies more
   frequently used in the classroom. Modelling activities for the study of
   a predator-prey system for a mathematics classroom in the first year of
   an undergraduate program in biosystems engineering have been designed
   and implemented. These activities were designed to put two modelling
   approaches side by side, an individual-based model and a set of ordinary
   differential equations. In order to organize and display this, a system
   with wolves and sheep in a confined domain was considered and studied.
   With the teaching material elaborated and a computer to perform the
   numerical resolutions involved and the corresponding individual-based
   simulations, the students answered questions and completed exercises to
   achieve the learning goals set. Students' responses regarding the
   modelling of biological systems and these two distinct methodologies
   applied to the study of a predator-prey system were collected via
   questionnaires, open-ended queries and face-to-face dialogues. Taking
   into account the positive responses of the students when they were doing
   these activities, it was clear that using a discrete individual-based
   model to deal with a predator-prey system jointly with a set of ordinary
   differential equations enriches the understanding of the modelling
   process, adds new insights and opens novel perspectives of what can be
   done with computational models versus other models. The complementary
   views given by the two modelling approaches were very well assessed by
   students.},

Title = {Team-based learning replaces problem-based learning at a large medical
   school},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 7},
Abstract = {AbsractBackground With increased student numbers in the Sydney Medical
   Program, and concerns regarding standardisation across cohorts, student
   satisfaction of the problem-based learning (PBL) model had decreased in
   recent years. In 2017, Team-based learning (TBL) replaced PBL in Years 1
   and 2 of the medical program. This study sought to explore students'
   perceptions of their experience of TBL, and to consider resource
   implications. Methods In 2017, Years 1 and 2 medical students (n = 625)
   participated in weekly TBL sessions, with approximately 60 students per
   class, consisting of 11 teams of five or six students. Each class was
   facilitated by a consultant, a basic scientist and a medical registrar.
   Prior to each class, students were given pre-work, and completed an
   online Individual Readiness Assurance Test (IRAT). During face-to-face
   class, students completed the Team Readiness Assurance Test (TRAT), and
   received feedback with clarification from facilitators, followed by
   clinical problem-solving activities. Student feedback was collected by
   questionnaire, using closed and open-ended items. Data were analysed
   using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Results In total,
   232/275 (84\%) Year 1 and 258/350 (74\%) Year 2 students responded to
   the questionnaire. Students found positive aspects of TBL included the
   small group dynamics, intra- and inter-team discussions, interactions
   with facilitators, provision of clinical contexts by clinicians, and the
   readiness assurance process. Suggested improvements included: better
   alignment of pre-reading tasks, shorter class time, increased
   opportunity for clinical reasoning, and additional feedback on the
   mechanistic flowchart. Resource efficiencies were identified, such as a
   reduction in the number of teaching sessions and required facilitators,
   and the ability to provide each classroom with clinical expertise.
   Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that TBL, as a replacement for PBL
   in Years 1 and 2 of the medical curriculum, provided a standardised
   approach to small group learning on a large scale, and also provided
   resource efficiencies. Students perceived benefits related to the active
   learning strategy of TBL that encourage individual learning,
   consolidation of knowledge, retrieval practice, peer discussion and
   feedback. However, improvements are needed in terms of better alignment
   of pre-reading tasks with the TBL patient case, and greater facilitator
   interaction during the problem-solving activities. Additionally,
   consideration should be given to reducing class time, and providing TRAT
   scores.},

Abstract = {Safety is an important area in engineering education and the trends
   nowadays are to promote its learning throughout an engineering
   curriculum and/or teaching safety as a stand-alone subject. Equipment
   design is one of the core subjects that chemical and process engineering
   students learn in their program. Learning of safety principles through
   their incorporation into equipment design is identified as an effective
   approach by experts in engineering education. This study presents a
   methodological framework for a cycle -based academic learning activity,
   incorporating the four safety strategies, namely, inherent, passive,
   active and procedural safety in the process of equipment design. A case
   study applying the proposed framework, on learning of safety protocols
   incorporated in the design of a reactor, is presented. Majority of the
   students subjected to this study believe that they learnt safety
   strategies through this activity and their perception on achieving
   learning outcomes is positive. (C) 2019 Institution of Chemical

Abstract = {While scholarly activity is recognized as critical in cancer education,
   there is an outstanding need for methods to define research learning
   competencies and tools for formal research productivity and competency
   assessment. We piloted and studied a novel educational initiative within
   the University of Wisconsin Hematology/Oncology fellowship program,
   establishing a professional learning community (PLC) of research mentors
   and developing a formative evaluation tool, a research portfolio. We
   developed a PLC engaged in reflective conversations about intended
   learning outcomes and effective instructional strategies. Subsequently,
   a research portfolio was piloted with four first-year
   Hematology/Oncology fellows at the start of the 2020 academic year in
   which trainees document, critically evaluate, and reflect upon the
   knowledge, skills, confidence, and productivity acquired during research
   training. We employed surveys to evaluate the initiative. Seven
   Hematology/Oncology fellows (7/12, 58\%) completed pre-intervention and
   six-month interim evaluation surveys, with 43\% (3/7) identifying an
   increased confidence in quality of research training strategies
   following the pilot initiation. All four first-year fellows that piloted
   the research portfolio (4/4, 100\%) completed interim evaluation surveys
   that demonstrated benefits of the research portfolio including
   self-reflection and goal setting. Research portfolio scoring correlated
   with other markers of academic success, suggesting its potential to
   predict research success. Our data suggest that bringing together a
   community of research mentors to generate shared learning goals and
   develop the framework for a formative evaluation portfolio may meet
   critical needs research training needs in cancer education. Given
   promising results, we aim to create a new educational tool for research
   training.},

Title = {Evaluation of a blended learning approach to developing
   specialty-nursing practice. An exploratory descriptive qualitative study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {98},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: An ageing population and a transitioning workforce is
   creating demands on healthcare workforces. Clinical and procedural
   knowledge deficits cause anxieties in new and experienced nurses alike
   when integrating into new teams. Overcoming these boundaries can be
   achieved with Introductory programs. These develop knowledge, technical
   skills and non-technical skills. Investigating nurses drive to undertake
   such programs, and the benefits they perceive for themselves, will help
   to tailor future programs. Objectives: To explore post-registration
   nurses' motivations for undertaking an introductory program that
   utilised a blended learning methodology. Identifying changes in
   participants understanding and clinical behaviours. Methods: An
   exploratory descriptive qualitative study design was used to evaluate
   the Introduction to Specialty Practice (ISP) program that is run by a
   large private healthcare provider in Melbourne, Australia. The health
   service includes eight campuses and four intensive care units across the
   group. Twelve participants from a mixture of critical care and acute
   care clinical areas were consented. They were interviewed using a semi
   structured questionnaire. Responses were transcribed verbatim and
   thematic analysis of the transcripts then occurred. Results: The study
   demonstrated intrinsic and extrinsic factors influenced participant's
   desires to undertake this program. Three major themes were evident: 1)
   that caring without knowledge was daunting, 2) that participants needed
   to create a clinical and professional identity and 3) that participant's
   perspective on their delivery of care improved, along with their
   professional aptitude. Conclusion: Maintaining currency with knowledge,
   skills, and technological developments is crucial for nurses to
   consistently deliver high-level care. The demands that nurses' face
   within their clinical areas affects their intention to stay within the
   workforce and their ability to deliver care. Introductory programs that
   utilise blended learning strategies have a role to play in enabling
   nurses to create their professional identity, find their position in
   clinical teams, and meet the requirements of organisations.},

Title = {Relationship Between Pharmacy Students' Use of Self-Regulated Learning
   Strategies and Course Outcomes},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {83},
Number = {10},
Pages = {2216-2222},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Objective. To determine the relationship between student-reported,
   self-regulated learning (SRL) with use of supplementary material, and
   overall performance in an advanced therapeutics course in a Doctor of
   Pharmacy program.
   Methods. A modified version of the Self-Regulated Strategy Inventory
   (SRSI-SI) was used to measure three distinct SRL factors: managing study
   behaviors, managing environment, and maladaptive regulatory behaviors.
   An instructor created a supplemental 36-question practice quiz and
   flashcard activity. The in-class assessment and the three SRL factors
   were analyzed using the practice quiz, and the association between
   overall course grade and score in each factor domain was determined by
   regression.
   Results. Two-hundred seven students (98\%) completed the SRSI. One
   hundred fifty-eight (79\%) students reported using the optional practice
   quiz and doing so was associated with significantly higher in-class quiz
   scores (8.2 vs 7.6 out of 10) and higher overall course grade (88.0\% vs
   85.3\%). Students reporting use of the optional practice quiz were
   significantly less likely to report poor study behaviors, inability to
   manage study environment, and maladaptive study habits. Lower overall
   course grades were significantly associated with maladaptive study
   habits.
   Conclusion. A positive association was determined between use of
   instructor-created supplemental activities and in-class quiz scores,
   self-regulated study behaviors, and overall course performance.
   Maladaptive study habits were associated with a modest negative
   correlation with overall course grade. The results suggest that when
   instructors create optional supplementary activities and assessments,
   many of the students who would benefit the most from the use of these
   activities fail to utilize the opportunity for extra practice.},

Title = {EEG Activities During Program Comprehension: An Exploration of Cognition},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {120407-120421},
Abstract = {This study attempts to explore cognition during program comprehension
   through physiological evidence by recording and comparing
   electroencephalogram (EEG) activities in different frequency bands and
   the eye movements of the participants with high or low programming
   abilities. An experiment was conducted with thirty-three undergraduate
   students majoring in Computer Science. We recorded their EEG activities
   when they were reading two programs with three types of program
   constructs. At the same time, the participants' eye movements were
   recorded by an eye tracker to further understand the relationship
   between the program comprehension process and EEG activities.
   Experimental results show that the high-performance participants
   displayed higher performance for working memory (theta power), attention
   resource allocation (lower alpha power), and interaction between working
   memory and semantic memory (upper alpha power) in program comprehension
   tasks of complex constructs, which proves related theories proposed in
   the existing research on programming and cognition. The results of this
   study not only offer objective evidence of the roles cognition plays in
   program comprehension but also provide educators with suggestions for
   designing suitable pedagogical strategies.},

Title = {The design, fate and impact of a hospital-wide training program in
   evidence-based medicine for physicians - an observational study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Month = {MAR 8},
Abstract = {Background: Many doctors fail to practice Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM)
   effectively, in part due to insufficient training. We report on the
   design, fate and impact of a short learner-centered EBM
   train-the-trainer program aimed at all 2400 doctors at the Karolinska
   University Hospital in Sweden on the heels of a tumultuous merger,
   focusing particularly on whether it affected the doctors' knowledge,
   attitudes and skills regarding EBM.
   Methods: We used a validated EBM instrument in a before-and-after design
   to assess the impact of the training. Changes in responses were analyzed
   at the individual level using the Wilcoxon matched pairs test. We also
   reviewed documentation from the program - including the modular EBM
   training schedule and the template for participants' Critically
   Appraised Topic reports - to describe the training's content, design,
   conduct, and fate.
   Results: The training, designed to be delivered in modules of 45 min
   totaling 1.5 days, failed to reach most doctors at the hospital, due to
   cost cutting pressures and competing demands. Among study participants
   (n = 174), many reported suboptimal EBM knowledge and skills before the
   training. Respondents' strategies for solving clinical problems changed
   after the training: the proportion of respondents reporting to use (or
   intend to use) secondary sources ``Often/very often{''} changed from 5
   \% before the training to 76 \% after the training; in parallel,
   reliance on textbooks and on colleagues fell (48 to 23 \% and 79 to 65
   \%, respectively). Participants' confidence in assessing scientific
   articles increased and their attitudes toward EBM became more positive.
   The proportion of correct answers in the EBM knowledge test increased
   from 52 to 71 \%. All these changes were statistically significant at p
   < 0.05.
   Conclusions: Many study participants, despite working at a university
   hospital, lacked basic EBM knowledge and skills and used the scientific
   literature suboptimally. The kind of short learner-centered EBM training
   evaluated here brought significant improvements among the minority of
   hospital doctors who were able to participate and, if applied widely,
   could contribute to better, safer and more cost-effective care.},

Abstract = {Background: Current dimensions of the primary health care research (PHC)
   context, including the need for contextualized research methods to
   address complex questions, and the co-creation of knowledge through
   partnerships with stakeholders - require PHC researchers to have a
   comprehensive set of skills for engaging effectively in high impact
   research.
   Main body: In 2002 we developed a unique program to respond to these
   needs - Transdisciplinary Understanding and Training on Research -
   Primary Health Care (TUTOR-PHC). The program's goals are to train a
   cadre of PHC researchers, clinicians, and decision makers in
   interdisciplinary research to aid them in tackling current and future
   challenges in PHC and in leading collaborative interdisciplinary
   research teams. Seven essential educational approaches employed by
   TUTOR-PHC are described, as well as the principles underlying the
   curriculum. This program is unique because of its pan-Canadian nature,
   longevity, and the multiplicity of disciplines represented. Program
   evaluation results indicate: 1) overall program experiences are very
   positive; 2) TUTOR-PHC increases trainee interdisciplinary research
   understanding and activity; and 3) this training assists in developing
   their interdisciplinary research careers. Taken together, the structure
   of the program, its content, educational approaches, and principles,
   represent a complex whole. This complexity parallels that of the PHC
   research context - a context that requires researchers who are able to
   respond to multiple challenges.
   Conclusion: We present this description of ways to teach and learn the
   advanced complex skills necessary for successful PHC researchers with a
   view to supporting the potential uptake of program components in other
   settings.},

Abstract = {Load aggregators (LAs) play a key role in fully tapping the demand
   response (DR) resources of small and medium-sized end-users to enable a
   more flexible power grid. In the ancillary service market, the LA can
   provide DR to the system by aggregating the resources of its users. In
   response to the issued DR program, end-users offer to provide DR
   resources. To help optimize the user bidding strategy, an evolutionary
   game model is presented here in view of the bounded rationality of
   bidders. A combined Q-learning and compound differential evolution (CDE)
   algorithm is proposed to deal with the problems of incomplete
   information and uncertainties in the opponents' decision-making, and
   prevent the evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) from falling into a local
   optimum. Moreover, a cloud-computing-based framework is designed and
   agent servers are introduced to protect data privacy. Numerical results
   show that by adopting the proposed algorithm, the user's bidding price
   keeps slightly lower than the opponents' price which guarantees its
   revenue remains on a high level. This indicates that the proposed
   algorithm has good adaptability for addressing incomplete information

Title = {Design and Implementation of a postgraduate curriculum to support
   Ethiopia's first emergency medicine residency training program: the
   Toronto Addis Ababa Academic Collaboration in Emergency Medicine
   (TAAAC-EM)},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},

Month = {APR 6},
Abstract = {Background: To design and implement an emergency medicine (EM)
   postgraduate training curriculum to support the establishment of the
   first EM residency program at Addis Ababa University (AAU).
   Methods: In response to the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health mandate
   to develop EM services in Ethiopia, University of Toronto EM faculty
   were invited to develop and deliver EM content and expertise for the
   first EM postgraduate residency training program at AAU. The Toronto
   Addis Ababa Academic Collaboration-EM (TAAAC-EM) used five steps of a
   six-step approach to guide curriculum development and implementation: 1.
   Problem identification and general needs assessment, 2. Targeted needs
   assessment using indirect methods (interviews and site visits of the
   learners and learning environment), 3. Defining goals and objectives, 4.
   Choosing educational strategies and curriculum map development and 5.
   Implementation.
   Results: The needs assessment identified a learning environment with
   appropriate, though limited, resources for the implementation of an EM
   residency program. A lack of educational activities geared towards EM
   practice was identified, specifically of active learning techniques
   (ALTs) such as bedside teaching, simulation and procedural teaching. A
   curriculum map was devised to supplement the AAU EM residency program
   curriculum. The TAAAC-EM curriculum was divided into three distinct
   streams: clinical, clinical epidemiology and EM administration. The
   clinical sessions were divided into didactic and ALTs including
   practical/procedural and simulation sessions, and bedside teaching was
   given a strong emphasis. Implementation is currently in its seventh
   year, with continuous monitoring and revisions of the curriculum to meet
   evolving needs.
   Conclusion: We have outlined the design and implementation of the
   TAAAC-EM curriculum; an evaluation of this curriculum is currently
   underway. As EM spreads as a specialty throughout Africa and other
   resource-limited regions, this model can serve as a working guide for
   similar bi-institutional educational partnerships seeking to develop
   novel EM postgraduate training programs.},

   Bayesian-based optimization model for planning urban green
   infrastructure investments},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE},

Abstract = {Urban stormwater management is shifting its attention from traditional
   centralized engineering solutions to a distributed and greener approach,
   namely Green Infrastructure (GI). However, uncertainties concerning GI's
   efficacy for reducing runoff and pollutants are a barrier to the
   adoption of GI. One strategy to deal with the uncertainty is to
   implement GI adaptively, in which stormwater managers can learn and
   adjust their plans over time to avoid undesired outcomes. We propose a
   new class of GI planning methods based on two-stage stochastic
   programming and Bayesian learning, which accounts for projected
   information gains and decision makers' objectives and willingness to
   accept risk. In the hypothetical example, the model identifies four
   categories of investment strategies and quantifies their benefits and
   costs: all-in, greedy investment plus deferral, mixed investments plus
   deferral, and learn-and-adjust. Which strategy is optimal depends on the
   user's risk attitudes, and the alternatives' costs and risks.},

Abstract = {Science education reform initiatives have been implemented worldwide in
   recent years focusing on the integration of science and engineering
   practices into science learning. In this context, one promising area to
   explore is how the resources provided by makerspaces can promote more
   meaningful, contextualized, and practice-based ways of teaching and
   learning science. Nonetheless, there are few studies, and even fewer
   from the Global South, that analyze how teachers perceive the potential
   of these resources and integrate them into their lesson plans. Using an
   in-depth case-study methodology, this paper investigates results from a
   project that engages teachers in co-designing curricular units
   integrating new resources and practice-based approaches to science
   learning. In particular, we study how one science teacher developed new
   understandings about the role of ``hands-on `` science activities as he
   participated in a professional development program over 4 years. Based
   on our findings, we suggest strategies for the design of programs aimed
   at integrating science practices and makerspace resources into school
   curricula.},

Title = {A national strategy to engage medical students in otolaryngology-head
   and neck surgery medical education: the LearnENT ambassador program},

Abstract = {Background In the realm of medical education, student-led ambassador
   programs represent an innovative approach to increase awareness about
   medical education resources. LearnENT is an internationally recognized
   otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (OHNS) smartphone app and website
   designed for medical trainees to learn about OHNS. However, upon the
   initial launch of the app, there was a lack of medical student awareness
   and engagement. Approach In this article, we highlight the process and
   lessons learned from developing an ambassador program to increase the
   national presence and uptake of LearnENT. Medical students from across
   Canada were recruited and trained to promote the app at their respective
   institutions. Evaluation Ambassadors hosted events and spearheaded
   initiatives around the country with the goal of showcasing LearnENT.
   Furthermore, ambassadors were engaged in scholarly initiatives such as
   creating educational content for LearnENT and giving presentations at
   national conferences. Reflections Critical factors in the success of a
   student-led ambassador program include ensuring widespread dissemination
   of the program, establishing clear expectations for ambassadors,
   equipping ambassadors with standardized promotional material, and
   promoting collaboration to collectively work towards addressing
   challenges. When creating a national student-led group such as an
   ambassador program, outreach to senior stakeholders can be an effective
   way to involve students at different institutions, provide mentorship
   opportunities for students and provide opportunities for educational
   scholarship. With new medical education innovations constantly
   surfacing, the LearnENT ambassador program model can be applied in other
   contexts to increase awareness of medical education resources.},

   Inspire Child Development Center including Early Childhood Education and
   Head Start (Washington; n = 160). Sixteen trials with 16-20 parent-child
   dyads per trial will provide adequate power to detect moderate effects.
   Intervention: Multicomponent family-based prevention program
   incorporating a dialogue approach to adult learning and
   self-determination theory.
   Main Outcome Measures: Child assessments will include observed taste
   preferences, caloric compensation, and eating in the absence of hunger.
   Parent assessments will include parent-reported feeding, feeding
   emotions, acculturation, child eating behaviors, child food preferences,
   and child dietary intake. Heights and weights will be measured for
   parent and child.
   Analysis: A multilevel growth modeling analysis will be employed to
   consider the nested nature of the data: time points (level 1) within
   families (level 2) within trials (level 3).},

Abstract = {Chronic illness treatment strategies must adapt to the evolving health
   status of the patient receiving treatment. Data-driven dynamic treatment
   regimes can offer guidance for clinicians and intervention scientists on
   how to treat patients over time in order to bring about the most
   favorable clinical outcome on average. Methods for estimating optimal
   dynamic treatment regimes, such as Q-learning, typically require
   modeling nonsmooth, nonmonotone transformations of data. Thus, building
   well-fitting models can be challenging and in some cases may result in a
   poor estimate of the optimal treatment regime. Interactive Q-learning
   (IQ-learning) is an alternative to Q-learning that only requires
   modeling smooth, monotone transformations of the data. The R package
   iqLearn provides functions for implementing both the IQ-learning and
   Q-learning algorithms. We demonstrate how to estimate a two-stage
   optimal treatment policy with iqLearn using a generated data set bmiData
   which mimics a two-stage randomized body mass index reduction trial with
   binary treatments at each stage.},

Title = {Implementation of team-based learning on a large scale: Three factors to
   keep in mind},
Journal = {MEDICAL TEACHER},

Volume = {40},

Pages = {582-588},
Abstract = {Team-based learning (TBL) is a structured form of small group learning
   that can be scaled up for delivery in large classes. The principles of
   successful TBL implementation are well established. TBL has become
   widely practiced in medical schools, but its use is typically limited to
   certain courses or parts of courses. Implementing TBL on a large scale,
   across different courses and disciplines, is the next logical step. The
   Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine), a partnership between
   Nanyang Technological University, Singapore and Imperial College London,
   admitted its first students in 2013. This new undergraduate medical
   program, developed collaboratively by faculty at both institutions, uses
   TBL as its main learning and teaching strategy, replacing all
   face-to-face lectures. TBL accounts for over 60\% of the curriculum in
   the first two years, and there is continued learning through TBL during
   campus teaching in the remaining years. This paper describes our
   experience of rolling out TBL across all years of the medical
   curriculum, focusing on three success factors: (1) ``team-centric{''}
   learning spaces, to foster active, collaborative learning; (2) an
   e-learning ecosystem, seamlessly integrated to support all phases of the
   TBL process and (3) teaching teams in which experts in pedagogical
   process (TBL Facilitators) co-teach with experts in subject matter
   (Content Experts).},

Abstract = {Diversification of our country's science talent pool is critically
   needed and can only be achieved by stimulating interest in science,
   technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) among students from a
   wide variety of cultural backgrounds. However, motivating, increasing
   the number, improving retention rates, and graduation rates of
   underrepresented minority (URM) students in STEM disciplines continue to
   be a major challenge and of active pedagogical interest to historically
   black colleges and universities (HBCU). Early involvement of URM
   students in research is a viable strategy to excite minority students in
   STEM areas. This work reported the use of the Raising Achievement in
   Mathematics and Science (RAMS) scholar and Summer Undergraduate Research
   Experience (SURE) programs at Winston-Salem State University (WSSU) as a
   strategy for promoting and stimulating the interest of URM students in
   STEM education at a HBCU institution. The influence of the RAMS scholar
   and SURE programs on the retention rate and STEM education of the URM
   students was examined. The experience of RAMS scholars and SURE
   participants was also evaluated by administering a survey to the
   participants upon completion of the program. The retention rates of the
   RAMS scholars and SURE participants were better than that of non-RAMS
   scholars or non-SURE participants. The analysis of the survey results
   indicated that the RAMS scholar and SURE programs clearly generated URM
   student excitement, while promoting critical thinking, teamwork, and
   leadership skills. Moreover, RAMS. scholars and SURE participants
   particularly enjoyed other program enrichment activities, including
   professional development seminars and social activities as well as
   poster and oral presentations at regional and national conferences.},

Title = {Instructional support for learning with agent-based simulations: A tale
   of vicarious and guided exploration learning approaches},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {142},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Science content knowledge is essential for many applied practices within
   health-care professions. With this in mind, the current study seeks to
   promote in-depth conceptual understanding of science pharmacology
   content among students from health-care programs nursing, nutrition, and
   health education by introducing learning with agent-based models. While
   the literature shows that learning with agent-based models promotes
   better conceptual understanding than more traditional approaches, to
   achieve these potential benefits, instructional supports are needed.
   This study employed an experimental pre- and post-test design comparing
   two forms of instructional approaches for learning with agent-based
   models: one group learned with agent based models using the vicarious
   approach, where pairs observed and collaboratively discussed recordings
   of others' learning with agent-based models; the other group explored
   agent-based models in pairs while collaboratively discussing a set of
   text-based prompts, the guided exploration approach. The results
   revealed significantly higher pharmacology learning gains following the
   vicarious instructional approach compared with the guided exploration of
   agent based models. Thus, findings suggest that learning from
   observation can be comparable and even superior to the guided
   exploration approach with regard to the immediate knowledge gains when
   collaboratively dialoguing with a peer while observing dialogue of
   others takes place. Future research should evaluate this instructional
   effect on knowledge retention and with long-term interventions.},

Title = {Implementing Peer Learning in Clinical Education: A Framework to Address
   Challenges In the ``Real World{''}},
Journal = {TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {162-172},
Abstract = {Phenomenon: Peer learning has many benefits and can assist students in
   gaining the educational skills required in future years when they become
   teachers themselves. Peer learning may be particularly useful in
   clinical learning environments, where students report feeling
   marginalized, overwhelmed, and unsupported. Educational interventions
   often fail in the workplace environment, as they are often conceived in
   the ideal rather than the complex, messy real world. This work sought to
   explore barriers and facilitators to implementing peer learning
   activities in a clinical curriculum. Approach: Previous peer learning
   research results and a matrix of empirically derived peer learning
   activities were presented to local clinical education experts to
   generate discussion around the realities of implementing such
   activities. Potential barriers and limitations of and strategies for
   implementing peer learning in clinical education were the focus of the
   individual interviews. Findings: Thematic analysis of the data
   identified three key considerations for real-world implementation of
   peer learning: culture, epistemic authority, and the primacy of
   patient-centered care. Strategies for peer learning implementation were
   also developed from themes within the data, focusing on developing a
   culture of safety in which peer learning could be undertaken, engaging
   both educators and students, and establishing expectations for the use
   of peer learning. Insights: This study identified considerations and
   strategies for the implementation of peer learning activities, which
   took into account both educator and student roles. Reported challenges
   were reflective of those identified within the literature. The resultant
   framework may aid others in anticipating implementation challenges.
   Further work is required to test the framework's application in other
   contexts and its effect on learner outcomes.},

Title = {Designing a National Longitudinal Faculty Development Curriculum Focused
   on Educational Scholarship: Process, Outcomes, and Lessons Learned},
Journal = {TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {337-350},
Abstract = {Problem: Clinical educators at U.S. academic health centers are
   frequently disadvantaged in the academic promotion system, lacking
   needed faculty development, mentoring, and networking support.
   Intervention: In 2006, we implemented the national Educational Scholars
   Program to offer faculty development in educational scholarship for
   early career educators in pediatrics. We aimed to provide them with
   skills, experience, and initial success in educational scholarship and
   dissemination. The 3-year curriculum is delivered in interactive
   sessions at the annual pediatric academic meetings and online
   intersession modules. Curriculum content progresses from educational
   scholarship and implementing scholarly projects to dissemination and
   professional networking. Intersession modules address project planning,
   building an educator portfolio, reviewing the literature, using
   technology, authorship, and peer review. Concurrently, all scholars must
   complete a mentored educational project and demonstrate national
   dissemination of a peer-reviewed product to obtain a Certificate of
   Excellence in Educational Scholarship. Context: The setting of this
   study was a national, longitudinal, cohort-based faculty development
   program built within the Academic Pediatric Association, a 2,000-member
   professional organization. Outcome: In 10years, the Educational Scholars
   Program has enrolled 172 scholars in 8 cohorts; 94 have graduated so
   far. We describe how formative evaluation guided curriculum refinement
   and process improvement. Summative evaluations show that faculty and
   scholars were satisfied with the program. Participant outcomes from
   Cohort 1, assessed at Kirkpatrick's four levels of evaluation,
   demonstrate increases in scholarly productivity, leadership activities,
   and academic promotions. Lessons Learned: Curriculum building is a
   dynamic process of ongoing evaluation and modification. Our program
   benefited from designing an integrated and focused curriculum,
   developing educational principles to guide program improvements,
   creating curricular tools to help learners organize and document their
   efforts, supporting project-based learning with expert mentoring, and
   facilitating peer and faculty networking and collaboration. A national,
   longitudinal faculty development program can support growth in academic
   knowledge and skills, promote professional networking, and thereby
   enrich educators' career opportunities.},

Title = {Dynamic pricing and inventory management with demand learning: A
   bayesian approach},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& OPERATIONS RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {124},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We consider a retail firm selling a durable product in a volatile market
   where the demand is price-sensitive and random but its distribution is
   unknown. The firm dynamically replenishes inventory and adjusts prices
   over time and learns about the demand distribution. Assuming that the
   demand model is of the multiplicative form and unmet demand is partially
   backlogged, we take the empirical Bayesian approach to formulate the
   problem as a stochastic dynamic program. We first identify a set of
   regularity conditions on demand models and show that the state-dependent
   base-stock list-price policy is optimal. We next employ the
   dimensionality reduction approach to separate the scale factor that
   captures observed demand information from the optimal profit function,
   which yields a normalized dynamic program that is more tractable. We
   also analyze the effect of demand learning on the optimal policy using
   the system without Bayesian update as a benchmark. We further extend our
   analysis to the case with unobserved lost sales and the case with
   additive demand. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Contribution: This article presents a synthesis of the findings and
   implications from the IC2Think program of research in undergraduate
   computer science (CS) courses examining student motivation and
   self-regulated learning (SRL). These studies illuminate both the
   difficulty and potential for motivating CS students, as well as the
   uniqueness of CS as a context for studying undergraduate motivation.
   Background: Computing disciplines are increasingly important in
   preparing the future workforce. It is imperative that CS educators
   understand how to motivate students and enhance student outcomes.
   Synthesizing findings across multiple studies allows for the emergence
   of new insights into student motivation and SRL. Research Questions:
   Which aspects of students' motivation and SRL are predictive of
   achievement and retention in CS and how can findings inform CS
   education? Methodology: The primary methodology is a comprehensive
   review of seven years of research on undergraduate CS education. Studies
   use a variety of analysis techniques, examine a range of constructs, and
   include multiple introductory and advanced CS courses. Studies of
   relationships between variables and change over time were conducted.
   Findings: The present synthesis of studies on motivation and SRL
   highlights the complex, counter-intuitive, and positive aspects of
   student motivation in CS.},

Abstract = {Nutrition is a critical issue for educators, particularly given the
   unhealthy eating behaviors of many adolescents. While knowledge and
   self-reflection are important, learners must also be motivated and held
   accountable for their health behaviors. In order to foster healthy
   eating, a technology-enhanced approach, game-based team learning (GBTL),
   is proposed, based on social-interdependence theory. A cloud diet
   assessment system (CDAS) was designed for automatically providing
   feedback on the nutritional intake of learners through a meal analysis
   algorithm. Furthermore, a cloud server hosted a social competitive game
   which, in addition to in-class team learning activities, allowed teams
   to compete against each other on the basis of each group's dietary
   habits. A pre-test post-test quasi-experimental design evaluated the
   effectiveness of the GBTL group (El) as compared to a group which
   received only metacognitive feedback from the CDAS (E2) and a comparison
   group (C). Female high school participants from three classes were
   randomly assigned to the three groups (C, n = 31; El, n = 20; E2, n =
   37). Results demonstrate significant improvement for E2 in terms of most
   food groups (including Dairy, Meats and Protein, Vegetables, and Fruit),
   as well as for macronutrients, such as calories and dietary fiber, and
   micronutrients, including Calcium and Vitamin C and B2. Within- and
   between-group comparisons confirmed the advantage of the E2 group,
   suggesting that technology-supported GBTL can foster healthy eating
   habits among adolescents, improving most nutritional elements to nearly
   100\% the recommended daily intake. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Oncology training focuses primarily on biomedical content rather than
   psychosocial content, which is not surprising in light of the enormous
   volume of technical information that oncology fellows assimilate in a
   short time. Nonetheless, the human connection, and specifically
   communication skills, remains as important as ever in caring for highly
   vulnerable patients with cancer. We previously described a year-long
   communication skills curriculum for oncology fellows that consisted of
   monthly 1-hour seminars with role play as the predominant teaching
   method (Epner and Baile, Acad Med. 89:578-84, 2014). Over several years,
   we adapted the curriculum based on learner feedback and reflection by
   faculty and teaching assistants and consolidated sessions into quarterly
   3-4-hour workshops. We now describe integrating stories into the
   curriculum as a way of building empathy and warming fellows to the
   arduous task of dealing with highly emotional content, such as
   conversations with young patients about transitioning off
   disease-directed therapy. Learners read and discussed published,
   medically themed stories; discussed their own patient care stories; and
   completed brief writing reflections and discussions. They then worked in
   small groups facilitated by faculty and upper level fellows who
   functioned as teaching assistants to work on applying specific skills
   and strategies to scenarios that they chose. Fellows completed anonymous
   surveys on which they rated the curriculum highly for relevance, value,
   organization, content, and teaching methods, including storytelling
   aspects. We conclude that sharing stories can help highly technical
   learners build reflective ability, mindfulness, and empathy, which are
   all critical ingredients of the art of medicine.},

Abstract = {The study of the relationships between self-regulated learning and
   formative assessment is an active line of research in the educational
   community. A recent review of the literature highlights that the study
   of these connections has been mainly unidirectional, focusing on how
   formative assessment helps students to self-regulate their learning,
   being much less explored the effect of self-regulated learning
   strategies on formative assessment. In this context, analyzing
   automatically captured students' activities within online learning tools
   can provide us further insights on the interactions between these two
   topics. More specifically, this article examines the activity traces of
   382 students who used an online tool to learn a programming language.
   The tool incorporates review exercises for promoting self-assessment (an
   important self-regulated learning strategy). Furthermore, the tool is
   used in supervised laboratories where students receive formative
   assessment. This study uses process mining techniques to analyze the
   temporal component of student behavior in both types of activities,
   their interaction, and how self-assessment relates to formative
   assessment. Some key lessons are learned: 1) activities promoting
   self-assessment significantly improved students' involvement in
   formative assessment activities; and 2) increasing self-assessment
   cannot compensate for a lack of effort in formative assessment. We also
   underline that, to the best of our knowledge, to date no research has
   used process mining to consider the time component in the analysis of
   the relationships between formative assessment and self-assessment.},

Abstract = {The energy management strategy of a hybrid electric vehicle directly
   determines the fuel economy of the vehicle. As a supervisory control
   strategy to divide the required power into its multiple power sources,
   engines and batteries, many studies have been conducting using
   rule-based and optimization-based approaches for energy management
   strategy so far. Recently, studies using various machine learning
   techniques have been conducted. In this paper, a novel control framework
   implementing Model-based Q-learning is developed for the optimal control
   problem of hybrid electric vehicles. As an online energy management
   strategy, a new approach could learn the characteristics of a current
   given driving environment and adaptively change the control policy
   through learning. Especially, for the proposed algorithm, the internal
   powertrain environment and external driving environment are separated so
   they can be learned via the reinforcement learning framework, which
   results in a simpler and more intuitive control strategy that can be
   explained using the vehicle state approximation model. The proposed
   algorithm is tested and verified through simulations, and the simulation
   results present near optimal solution. The simulation results are
   compared with conventional rule-based strategies and optimal control
   solutions acquired from Dynamic Programming.},

   A qualitative investigation of midwifery and anesthesia training
   programs in Ethiopia},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {55},
Pages = {5-10},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: Ethiopia has successfully expanded training for midwives and
   anesthetists in public institutions. This study explored the perceptions
   of trainers (instructors, clinical lab assistants and preceptors)
   towards the adequacy of students' learning experience and implications
   for achieving mastery of core competencies.
   Methods: In-depth interviews with 96 trainers at 9 public universities
   and 17 regional health science colleges across Ethiopia were conducted
   to elicit their opinions about available resources, program curriculum
   suitability, and competence of graduating students. Using Dedoose, data
   were thematically analyzed using grounded theory.
   Results: Perceptions of anesthesia and midwifery programs were similar.
   Common challenges included unpreparedness and poor motivation of
   students, shortages of skills lab space and equipment, difficulties
   ensuring students' exposure to sufficient and varied enough cases to
   develop competence, and lack of coordination between academic training
   institutions and clinical attachment sites. Additional logistical
   barriers included lack of student transport to clinical sites.
   Informants recommended improved recruitment strategies, curriculum
   adjustments, increased time in skills labs, and better communication
   across academic and clinical sites.
   Conclusions: An adequate learning environment ensures that graduating
   midwives and anesthetists are competent to provide quality services.
   Minimizing the human resource, infrastructural and logistical gaps
   identified in this study requires continued, targeted investment in
   health systems strengthening.},

Abstract = {Nanotechnology has made a huge impact on science, technology, and
   society. At the same time, educational institutions at all levels have
   recognized its relevance and introduced courses that aim at
   familiarizing their students with the basic concepts of nanotechnology.
   While the importance of teaching nanotechnology, the contents of such
   courses, and insightful activities in the laboratory have received a lot
   of attention, the classroom activities that help students grasp the
   concepts of nanotechnology have been rather underrepresented, especially
   in higher education. Here, we describe a student activity that focuses
   on a research proposal as part of a third-year undergraduate
   nanotechnology course for chemistry majors. Students work in pairs to
   review a relevant and contemporary topic in nanotechnology and to
   propose and develop an original research idea. This is presented and
   defended in the form of an oral presentation before an audience of peers
   and is written using an article template. The aim of the described
   approach is to not only help students learn about nanotechnology in a

Title = {Confidence, Connection \& Collaboration: Creating a Scalable Bias
   Reduction Improvement Coaching Train-the-Trainer Program to Mitigate
   Implicit Bias across a Medical Center},
Journal = {TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 8},
Abstract = {Problem: Academic medical centers need to mitigate the negative effects
   of implicit bias with approaches that are empirically-based, scalable,
   sustainable, and specific to departmental needs. Guided by Kotter's
   Model of Change to create and sustain cultural change, we developed the
   Bias Reduction Improvement Coaching Program (BRIC), a two-year,
   train-the-trainer implicit bias coaching program designed to meet the
   increasing demand for bias training across a university medical center.
   Intervention: BRIC trained a cohort of faculty and staff as coaches
   during four quarterly training sessions in Year 1 that covered 1) the
   science of bias, 2) bias in selection and hiring, 3) bias in mentoring,
   and 4) bias in promotion, retention, and workplace culture. In Year 2,
   coaches attended two booster sessions and delivered at least two
   presentations. BRIC raises awareness of bias mitigation strategies in a
   scalable way by uniquely building capacity through department-level
   champions, providing programming that addresses the `local context,' and
   setting a foundation for sustained institutional change. Context: In a
   U.S. academic medical center, 27 faculty and staff from 24 departments
   were trained as inaugural BRIC coaches. We assessed outcomes at multiple
   levels: BRIC coach outcomes (feedback on the training sessions; coach
   knowledge, attitudes, and skills), departmental-level outcomes (program
   attendee feedback, knowledge, and intentions) and institutional outcomes
   (activities to sustain change). Impact: After Year 1, coaches reported
   high satisfaction with BRIC and a statistically significant increase in
   self-efficacy in their abilities to recognize, mitigate, and teach about
   implicit bias. In Year 2, attendees at BRIC coach presentations reported
   an increase in bias mitigation knowledge, and the majority committed to
   taking follow-up action (e.g., taking an Implicit Association Test).
   Coaches also launched activities for sustaining change at the broader
   university and beyond. Lessons Learned: The BRIC Program indicates a
   high level of interest in receiving bias mitigation training, both among
   individuals who applied to be BRIC coaches and among presentation
   attendees. BRIC's initial success supports future expansion. The model
   appears scalable and sustainable; future efforts will formalize the
   emerging community of practice around bias mitigation and measure
   elements of on-going institutional culture change.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Leadership has emerged as a crucial component of
   professional development for physicians in academic medicine. Most
   leadership skills can be learned and therefore best practices of
   delivering leadership development are in high demand. For practicing
   surgeons, specific strategies to teach leadership have been lacking.
   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to describe the structure of a
   tier-based leadership development program called Leaders Growing
   Leaders, to identify the major curricular components to each tier
   including measures and outcomes, and to share lessons learned for those
   who may want to begin a similar leadership development program. (C) 2018

Title = {Putting undergraduate medical students in AI-CDSS designers? shoes: An
   innovative teaching method to develop digital health critical thinking},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {171},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Introduction: Digital health programs are urgently needed to accelerate
   the adoption of Artificial Intelligence and Clinical Decision Support
   Systems (AI-CDSS) in clinical settings. However, such programs are still
   lacking for undergraduate medical students, and new approaches are
   required to prepare them for the arrival of new and unknown
   technologies. At University Paris Cite ` medical school, we designed an
   innovative program to develop the digital health critical thinking of
   undergraduate medical students that consisted of putting medical
   students in AI-CDSS designers' shoes. Methods: We followed the six steps
   of Kern's approach for curriculum development: identification of needs,
   definition of objectives, design of an educational strategy,
   implementation, development of an assessment and design of program
   evaluation. Results: A stand-alone and elective AI-CDSS program was
   implemented for fourth-year medical students. Each session was designed
   from an AI-CDSS designer viewpoint, with theoretical and practical
   teaching and brainstorming time on a project that consisted of designing
   an AI-CDSS in small groups. From 2021 to 2022, 15 students were
   enrolled: they rated the program 4.4/5, and 80\% recommended it.
   Seventy-four percent considered that they had acquired new skills useful
   for clinical practice, and 66\% felt more confident with technologies.
   The AI-CDSS program aroused great enthusiasm and strong engagement of
   students: 8 designed an AI-CDSS and wrote two scientific 5-page articles
   pre-sented at the Medical Informatics Europe conference; 4 students were
   involved in a CDSS research project; 2 students asked for a hospital
   internship in digital health; and 1 decided to pursue PhD training.
   Discussion: Putting students in AI-CDSS designers' shoes seemed to be a
   fruitful and innovative strategy to develop digital health skills and
   critical thinking toward AI technologies. We expect that such programs
   could help future doctors work in rapidly evolving digitalized
   environments and position themselves as key leaders in digital health.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the effectiveness of the flipped classroom
   methodology to build conceptual knowledge mental models. In particular,
   it examines the learning process and outcomes of 40 students of a course
   on Physical Electronics in the last year of a bachelor's degree program
   in Physics, for which specific educational resources have been developed
   to implement the flipped classroom. Among them, non-interactive
   resources are better to present topics and ideas, whereas interactive
   resources are more useful to establish links between them to build and
   check the models. The examined data entail grades, laboratory reports
   and rubrics, outcomes of learning activities, and direct observation,
   showing that the flipped classroom improves the construction of mental
   models, providing teaching resources where the topics and main ideas are
   presented, developed and exercised, and allowing students to establish
   links to build and check the models. Furthermore, this strategy
   increases the personal commitment of the students, fostering autonomy
   and cooperation with peers, all of which makes it an effective
   pedagogical tool to build knowledge mental models.},

Title = {Real-Time Energy Management for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles via
   Incorporating Double-Delay Q-Learning and Model Prediction Control},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {131076-131089},
Abstract = {Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have been validated as a
   preferable solution to transportation due to its great advantages in
   fuel economy promotion, harmful emission reduction and mileage anxiety
   mitigation. While, designing an effective energy management strategy to
   allocate the power between battery and engine is critical to improve the
   performance of powertrain in PHEVs. To this end, a real-time energy
   management strategy is proposed via incorporating double-delay
   Q-Learning and model predictive control (MPC). First, the energy
   management for PHEV is transformed into a nonlinear optimal control
   problem, and the vehicle speed predictor based on convolutional neural
   network is proposed to forecast vehicle speed in MPC. Then, based on the
   predicted vehicle speed, the double-delay Q-Learning algorithm is
   implemented to solve the receding horizon optimal problem in the MPC
   module. The simulation is conducted to verify the performance of the
   proposed strategy, and the results showcase that incorporating the
   double-delay Q-Learning into MPC can effectively improve the
   adaptability of energy management to dynamic environment, and meanwhile
   achieve a similar fuel consumption of the offline stochastic dynamic
   programming-based strategy. In addition, the single-step computation
   time of the proposed strategy is less than 23 milliseconds, highlighting
   its significant potential in online implementation.},

Title = {A logistic regression investigation of the relationship between the
   Learning Assistant model and failure rates in introductory STEM courses},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Month = {DEC 28},
Abstract = {BackgroundLarge introductory STEM courses historically have high failure
   rates, and failing such courses often leads students to change majors or
   even drop out of college. Instructional innovations such as the Learning
   Assistant model can influence this trend by changing institutional
   norms. In collaboration with faculty who teach large-enrollment
   introductory STEM courses, undergraduate learning assistants (LAs) use
   research-based instructional strategies designed to encourage active
   student engagement and elicit student thinking. These instructional
   innovations help students master the types of skills necessary for
   college success such as critical thinking and defending ideas. In this
   study, we use logistic regression with pre-existing institutional data
   to investigate the relationship between exposure to LA support in large
   introductory STEM courses and general failure rates in these same and
   other introductory courses at University of Colorado Boulder.ResultsOur
   results indicate that exposure to LA support in any STEM gateway course
   is associated with a 63\% reduction in odds of failure for males and a
   55\% reduction in odds of failure for females in subsequent STEM gateway
   courses.ConclusionsThe LA program appears related to lower course
   failure rates in introductory STEM courses, but each department involved
   in this study implements the LA program in different ways. We
   hypothesize that these differences may influence student experiences in
   ways that are not apparent in the current analysis, but more work is
   necessary to support this hypothesis. Despite this potential limitation,
   we see that the LA program is consistently associated with lower failure
   rates in introductory STEM courses. These results extend the research
   base regarding the relationship between the LA program and positive
   student outcomes.},

Title = {Development of a game-design workshop girls' interest towards computing
   through exploration to promote young identity},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Pages = {115-130},

Abstract = {Despite recent improvements, women remain underrepresented in Computer
   Science (CS) in both industry and higher education. Self-perception and
   identity play an important role in young women's opinions of careers in
   CS. We believe that by presenting software programming in a way that
   facilitates identity exploration early on, young girls will be more
   likely to consider careers in CS later in life. In partnership with an
   organization that focuses on technology education for middle school
   girls we developed a game design workshop in an effort to change young
   girls' perception of CS by increasing their knowledge of programming and
   empowering them to develop their own identities as computer scientists.
   This paper presents the results of a case study with 21 participants
   that was carried out to evaluate the workshop's short-term influence on
   young girls' attitudes towards CS. The study employed a mixed methods
   design, including a pre and post application of a validated survey
   instrument, focus-group interviews, and content analysis of games
   developed by the students. The pre and post surveys focused on how
   students' attitudes towards computing may have been influenced by their
   participation in the workshop; the focus-group interviews aimed to gain
   further insight into their workshop experience; and the content analysis
   of games focused on the learning outcomes of our workshop. The findings
   suggest that the workshop resulted in improvements in both young girls'
   attitudes towards CS as well as in their self-reported confidence and
   competence with computers. These results highlight the importance of
   providing positive identity exploration opportunities in shaping female
   students' attitudes towards CS. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {To promote student learning, educational strategies should provide
   multiple levels of engagement with the subject matter. This study
   investigated examination data from five first year medical gross anatomy
   class cohorts (692 students) to determine if enhanced student
   performance was correlated with learning through dissection in a course
   that used a rotating dissection schedule coupled with peer teaching and
   other associated experiences. When students performed two of five weekly
   dissections for a given unit, their average scores on both laboratory
   and written examinations tended to increase as compared to when they had
   completed only one week of dissection (P<0.01). However, these
   performance gains differed across the class strata and were related to
   the amount of dissection completed. Students in the upper quartile (UQS)
   of the class benefited when they had dissected once (92.8\%) or twice
   (92.4\%), and these scores were significantly higher than those attained
   when learning from peers (90.3\%, P<0.01). Students in the lower
   quartile (LQS) benefited most from the dissection experiences, where
   practical examination performance was better (77.8\% and 80.5\%) than
   when these students learned material from their peers (73.7\%, P<0.01).
   Although UQS benefited from dissection, LQS benefited to a greater
   extent in both the practical and written examinations with dissection.
   Although limited, these data suggest that dissection, coupled with
   associated educational activities, is an effective pedagogical strategy
   for learning. Further investigation is required to evaluate the
   concomitant benefits of peer teaching that are associated with the
   dissection experience. Anat Sci Educ 9: 238-246. (c) 2015 American

Title = {What all students in healthcare training programs should learn to
   increase health equity: perspectives on postcolonialism and the health
   of Aboriginal Peoples in Canada},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Month = {SEP 23},
Abstract = {Background: The ongoing role of colonialism in producing health
   inequities is well-known. Postcolonialism is a theoretical approach that
   enables healthcare providers to better understand and address health
   inequities in society. While the importance of postcolonialism and
   health (PCH) in the education of clinicians has been recognized, the
   literature lacks guidance on how to incorporate PCH into healthcare
   training programs. This study explores the perspectives of key
   informants regarding content related to PCH that should be included in
   Canadian healthcare training programs, and how this content should be
   delivered.
   Methods: This qualitative study involved in-depth, semi-structured
   interviews with nineteen individuals with insight into PCH in Canada.
   Data were analyzed collaboratively to identify, code and translate key
   emergent themes according to the six phases of the DEPICT method.
   Results: Three themes emerged related to incorporating PCH into Canadian
   healthcare training programs: (1) content related to PCH that should be
   taught; (2) how this content should be delivered, including teaching
   strategies, who should teach this content and when content should be
   taught, and; (3) why this content should be taught. For the Canadian
   context, participants advised that PCH content should include a
   foundational history of colonization of Aboriginal Peoples in Canada,
   how structures rooted in colonialism continue to produce health
   inequities, and how Canadian clinicians' own experiences of privilege
   and oppression affect their practice. Participants also advised that
   this content should be integrated longitudinally through a variety of
   interactive teaching strategies and developed in collaboration with
   Aboriginal partners to address health inequities.
   Conclusions: These findings reinforce that clinicians and educators must
   understand health and healthcare as situated in social, political and
   historical contexts rooted in colonialism. Postcolonialism enables
   learners to understand and respond to how colonialism creates and
   sustains health inequities. This empirical study provides educators with
   guidance regarding PCH content and delivery strategies for healthcare
   training programs. More broadly, this study joins the chorus of voices
   calling for critical reflection on the limits and harms of an
   exclusively Western worldview, and the need for action to name and
   correct past wrongs in the spirit of reconciliation and justice for all.},

Abstract = {Debriefing is an essential component of simulation-based learning and is
   a constructive teaching strategy for teachers and an effective learning
   method to consolidate knowledge and skills for students. The purpose of
   this study was to verify the importance of debriefing in
   simulation-based learning for students in a nursing program.
   Participants in this study were 49 second-year nursing students who were
   enrolled at the Red Cross College of Nursing in Seoul, Korea. Collected
   data were analyzed using chi(2) test, t test, and independent t test
   statistics. There were significant differences between students in the
   debriefing group and those in the no-debriefing group evaluated. The
   level of clinical performance competency, self-reflection, and
   satisfaction with simulation-based learning for debriefing group
   students was higher than that for no-debriefing group. Debriefing was an
   important factor in simulation-based learning to improve technical and
   nontechnical skills and facilitate self-reflection. These results
   suggest that debriefing by a trained instructor is essential for
   maximizing simulation-based learning success. In absence of a trained
   debriefing instructor, various alternative forms of debriefing should be
   considered.},

Abstract = {Teaching materials characterization to support student research projects
   requires a systematic educational approach, because characterization
   involves a combination of analysis instruments. As analytical
   instruments are expensive, it is difficult to provide multiple sets
   simultaneously. An effective educational program allows students to
   select their own research materials to characterize and apply their
   personal strategies of instrumental analysis. These strategies are
   designed around the purposes of the analytical instruments, e.g.,
   molecular structure analysis, crystal structure analysis, morphology
   assessment, surface analysis, elemental analysis, and thermal analysis.
   An open-ended laboratory complements this educational purpose. Here, we
   report on an open-ended laboratory program for fourth-year undergraduate
   and graduate students at the Materials Characterization Central
   Laboratory at Waseda University (Tokyo, Japan). The goals of our
   open-ended laboratory program are to enable students to (1) conduct
   instrumental analysis, (2) operate analytical instruments, and (3)
   interpret their data. A team led by a supervisor and laboratory staff
   offers students a flexible program. This flexibility can be applied to
   various research fields, such as macromolecular chemistry, inorganic
   chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, electrochemistry,
   physics, catalyst chemistry, biomaterials science, and chemical
   engineering. These diverse research fields demonstrate the feasibility
   of applying our open-ended laboratory program to student research
   projects.},

Abstract = {Control of the stochastic dynamics of a quantum system is indispensable
   in fields such as quantum information processing and metrology. However,
   there is no general ready-made approach to the design of efficient
   control strategies. Here, we propose a framework for the automated
   design of control schemes based on differentiable programming. We apply
   this approach to the state preparation and stabilization of a qubit
   subjected to homodyne detection. To this end, we formulate the control
   task as an optimization problem where the loss function quantifies the
   distance from the target state, and we employ neural networks (NNs) as
   controllers. The system's time evolution is governed by a stochastic
   differential equation (SDE). To implement efficient training, we
   backpropagate the gradient information from the loss function through
   the SDE solver using adjoint sensitivity methods. As a first example, we
   feed the quantum state to the controller and focus on different methods
   of obtaining gradients. As a second example, we directly feed the
   homodyne detection signal to the controller. The instantaneous value of
   the homodyne current contains only very limited information on the
   actual state of the system, masked by unavoidable photon-number
   fluctuations. Despite the resulting poor signal-to-noise ratio, we can
   train our controller to prepare and stabilize the qubit to a target
   state with a mean fidelity of around 85\%. We also compare the solutions
   found by the NN to a hand-crafted control strategy.},

Abstract = {It has been suggested that the attitudes, beliefs and expectations of
   students about learning physics can impact the way they perform in
   physics courses. Here, our aim is to understand the beliefs and
   attitudes of engineering students of an accredited Colombian university
   about physics and how physics should be taught in this context. Our
   research process includes the translation of a pre-existing survey, its
   subsequent validation in the Spanish language, and its application as a
   diagnostic test. This survey is based on CLASS, an instrument developed
   by researchers at the University of Colorado that consists of 42
   Likert-type questions. The results of this instrument, which is based on
   the expert-novice comparison technique, can be distributed into eight
   categories relating to beliefs and attitudes about physics. We applied
   this survey to more than 700 first-year students of engineering
   programs. Based on the student responses, we discuss the overall results
   and specifically focus on the three categories that had the lowest
   student favorability values compared to expert opinions Conceptual
   Connections (47.1\%), Problem Solving Sophistication (44.6\%), and
   Applied Conceptual Understanding (36\%). Our overall results (56.5\%)
   are comparable to those obtained by surveying students in other
   countries and cultures with the same test, such as USA (62\%) and Saudi
   Arabia (55\%). Furthermore, we highlight some of the answers of the
   students, and examine the effects that their beliefs have on their
   attitude. Therefore, physics courses should be oriented or prepared in
   such a way that students can strengthen their beliefs and attitudes.
   Strategies focused on developing high levels of confidence should be
   taken into account. Finally, we provide some recommendations of how
   physics teachers can promote a positive attitude among their students,
   such as classroom debates related to physics topics in order to help
   students to develop their different perspectives about a specific issue
   or phenomenon, enforcing the idea that there is not only one correct way
   to reach a solution or solve a problem.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: School-based programs represent an ideal setting to enhance
   healthy eating, as most children attend school regularly and consume at
   least one meal and a number of snacks at school each day. However,
   current research reports that elementary school teachers often display
   low levels of nutritional knowledge, self-efficacy, and skills to
   effectively deliver nutrition education.
   METHODS: The purpose of this review was to understand the availability
   and quality of resources that are accessible for elementary school
   teachers to use to support curriculum delivery or nutrition education
   programs. The review included 32 resources from 4 countries in the final
   analysis from 1989 to 2014.
   RESULTS: The 32 resources exhibited 8 dominant teaching strategies:
   curriculum approaches; cross-curricular approaches; parental
   involvement; experiential learning approaches; contingent reinforcement
   approaches; literary abstraction approaches; games-based approaches; and
   web-based approaches. The resources were accessible to elementary school
   teachers, with all the resources embedding curriculum approaches, and
   most of the resources embedding parental involvement strategies.
   CONCLUSIONS: Resources were less likely to embed cross-curricular and
   experiential learning approaches, as well as contingent reinforcement
   approaches, despite recent research suggesting that the most effective
   evidence-based strategies for improving healthy eating in elementary
   school children are cross-curricular and experiential learning
   approaches.},

Abstract = {BackgroundMartinique shares with the other Caribbean countries specific
   public health issues, particularly in the diagnostic and therapeutic
   management of cancer patients. Mutualization of human and material
   resources by promoting cooperation is the most appropriate response to
   the challenges of the health systems of the Caribbean territories.
   Through the French PRPH-3 program, we propose to set up a collaborative
   digital platform adapted to the specificities of the Caribbean to
   strengthen professional links and skills in oncofertility and
   oncosexology and reduce inequalities in access to reproductive and
   sexual health care for cancer patients.MethodsWithin the context of this
   program, we have developed of an open-source platform based on a
   Learning Content Management System (LCMS), with an operating system
   developed by UNFM for low speed internet. LO libraries have been created
   and interaction between trainers and learners were done in asynchronous
   mode. This training management platform is based on: a TCC learning
   system (Training, Coaching, Communities); a web-hosting with pedagogical
   engineering appropriate to low bandwidth; a reporting system and a
   responsibility for processing.ResultsWe have carried out a flexible,
   multilingual and accessible digital learning strategy functionality
   called e-MCPPO according to low-speed internet ecosystem. In close
   connection with the e-learning strategy we conceived (i) a
   multidisciplinary team; (ii) an appropriate training program for expert
   health professionals and (iii) a responsive design.Discussion and
   ConclusionThis low-speed web-based infrastructure allows communities of
   experts to cooperate in creating, validating, publishing and managing
   academic learning content. The self-learning modules provide the digital
   layer for each learner to extend their skills. Learners, as well as
   trainers, would gradually take ownership of this platform and encourage
   its promotion. Innovation in this context is both technological
   (low-speed Internet broadcasting, free interactive software) and
   organizational (moderating educational resources). This collaborative
   digital platform is unique in its form and content. This challenge could
   contribute to the digital transformation of the Caribbean ecosystem for
   capacity building in this specifics topics.},

Abstract = {Demand response (DR), as a vital component of smart grid, plays an
   important role in shaping the load profiles in order to improve system
   reliability and efficiency. Incentive-based DR has been used in many DR
   programs by incentivizing customers to adapt their loads to supply
   availability. Note that users' behavior patterns can be easily
   identified from fine-grained power consumption when interacting with the
   load serving entity (LSE), giving rise to serious privacy concerns. One
   common approach to address the privacy threats is to incorporate
   perturbations in users' load measurements. Although it can protect the
   users' privacy, yet the usage data modification would degrade the LSE's
   performance in achieving an optimal incentive strategy due to unknown
   characteristics of the augmented perturbations. In this paper, we cast
   the incentive-based DR problem as a stochastic Stackelberg game. To
   tackle the challenge induced by users' privacy protection behaviors, we
   propose a two-timescale reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the
   optimal incentive strategy under users' perturbed responses. The
   proposed algorithm computes the expected utility cost to mitigate the
   impacts of the random characteristics of the augmented perturbations and
   then updates the incentive strategy based on the perceived expected
   utility costs. We derive the conditions under which the proposed
   incentive scheme converges almost surely to an epsilon-optimal strategy.
   The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using extensive
   numerical simulation using real data.},

Abstract = {This paper simulates a futures market with multiple agents and
   sequential auctions, where agents receive long-lived heterogeneous
   signals on the true value of an asset and with a known deadline. The
   evolution of the amount of differential information and its impact on
   the distribution of overall gains and the pace of truth discovery is
   examined for various depth levels of the limit order book (LOB). The
   paper also formulates a dynamic programming model for the problem and
   presents an associated reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for finding
   optimal strategy in exploiting informational disparity. This is done
   from the perspective of an agent whose information is superior to the
   collective information of the rest of the market. Finally, a numerical
   analysis is presented based on a futures market example to validate the
   proposed methodology for finding the optimal strategy. We find evidence
   in favor of a waiting strategy where agent does not reveal her signal
   until the last auction before the deadline. This result may help bring
   more insight into the micro-structural dynamics that work against market
   efficiency.},

Title = {A game theoretic analysis of knowledge sharing behavior of academics:
   Bi-level programming application},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {131},
Pages = {13-27},

Abstract = {Knowledge sharing amongst academics is a key process for universities to
   survive in the face of new changes in the education market. Despite the
   bulk of research on knowledge sharing, there are few studies on
   knowledge sharing analysis in higher education based on the game theory.
   Considering this gap, this paper aims to propose a nonlinear Bi-Level
   Programming (BLP) model to analyze the knowledge sharing behavior of
   academics. The proposed model considers decisions made by Faculty Head
   (FH) and Faculty Members (FMs) at two separate but integrated levels.
   The upper-level problem is related to FH decisions about compensation
   rates, and the lower-level problem represents FM decisions in the
   motivation, opportunity and ability (MOA) framework. This modeling
   approach has several advantages including the consideration of both FHs
   and FMs decisions, and various factors influencing knowledge sharing
   using the MOA framework in a single model as well as the analysis of
   four different activities of FMs, including teaching, learning, sharing
   tacit knowledge and publishing codified knowledge in a single integrated
   model. The bi-level programming model was reduced to a single level
   nonlinear problem using KKT conditions. The resultant problem was solved
   for a set of randomly generated data. Results indicated that the optimal
   behavior of an FM varied relative to characteristics of other FMs. Also,
   the analysis of the solution at different levels of trust showed that
   its improvement might have a different effect on FMs. Extending the
   application of the model and developing efficient algorithms for its
   solution are suggested for future research.},

Abstract = {IntroductionTo develop lifelong learning skills, students need feedback,
   access to performance data, and coaching. Anew medical curriculum
   incorporated infrastructural supports based on self-regulated learning
   theory and the Master Adaptive Learner framework to engage students in
   reflection and learning planning. This study examines students'
   experience with aperformance dashboard, longitudinal coaching, and
   structured time for goal-setting.MethodsFocus groups with first-year
   medical students explored performance dashboard usage, coaching and
   learning planning. We analyzed findings using thematic analysis. Results
   informed development of a29-item survey rated strongly disagree(1) to
   strongly agree(5) to investigate experience with the dashboard, coaching
   and learning goals program. The survey was distributed to one first-year
   medical student class. We performed descriptive statistics and factor
   analysis.ResultsIn three focus groups with 21participants, students
   endorsed using the dashboard to access performance information but had
   trouble interpreting and integrating information. They valued coaches as
   sources of advice but varied in their perceptions of the value of
   discussing learning planning. Of 152 students, 114 (75\%) completed the
   survey. Exploratory factor analysis yielded 5factors explaining 57\% of
   the variance: learning goals development (=0.88; mean 3.25 (standard
   deviation 0.91)), dashboard usage (=0.82; 3.36 (0.64)), coaching (=0.71;
   3.72 (0.64)), employment of learning strategies (=0.81; 3.67 (0.79)),
   and reflection (=0.63; 3.68 (0.64)).DiscussionThe student performance
   dashboard provides efficient feedback access, yet students' use of this
   information to guide learning is variable. These results can inform
   other programs seeking to foster lifelong learning skills.},

Abstract = {It is critical that we understand and address features of learning
   environments that encumber students historically underrepresented in
   STEM fields. Here we consider social elements of group work that can
   either support or impede learning. We tracked gender-bias in
   student-teaching assistant (TA) interactions in 184 small groups across
   27 introductory chemistry laboratories in fall 2017. We demonstrate that
   in some environments male students interacted with TAs
   disproportionately more than female students. To promote verbal
   participation of women in introductory chemistry courses, we advocate
   for improved TA training programs that teach a host of equitable
   teaching strategies to enhance the climate of the classrooms and
   consequently, improve learning. Fostering a structured, inclusive
   classroom environment is the first step towards achieving equity more
   broadly across STEM.},

Abstract = {Lecture recording is now common in many educational institutions,
   leading to discussion about how best to support student learning. In
   this mixed methods study, we used a survey (n = 46 participants),
   think-aloud methodologies in observed study sessions (n = 8
   participants) and recording analytics (n = 637 recordings) to
   characterize how veterinary students utilize recordings during their
   studies. Only 48\% of survey respondents considered they were more
   likely to use recordings as exams approached, but 78\% considered they
   used recordings more when the topic was difficult. In the observed study
   sessions, students characterized their use of recordings as helping them
   to control their learning environment, allowing them to pause and rewind
   challenging topics, and as a jumping off point for future study,
   allowing them to structure the seeking out of additional information. In
   a linear model describing the recording analytics, students who had
   entered higher education directly from high school were more likely to
   watch more of a lecture than graduate entry students. In addition, the
   most visited lectures were also the ones with more view time (F-(5,F-
   631) = 129.5, R-2 = 0.50, p < .001). Overall, this study suggests that
   veterinary students were selective about their use of recordings in
   their study strategies, often using them to make up for deficits in
   their knowledge and understanding, or to supplement their experience at
   veterinary school. We discuss the consequences and implications for
   student study skills support.},

Abstract = {Service learning is a community-based educational approach where college
   students are connected to academic content through active participation
   in planned community experiences. Therefore, service learning is the
   form of civic engagement that we have used to connect Chemistry
   undergraduate students with K-12 students, teachers, and parents in our
   community. We have developed several outreach programs and hands-on
   experiences to use the knowledge and skills learned in Chemistry courses
   and laboratories to motivate more precollege students toward a positive
   attitude about Chemistry and science courses in general. Undergraduate
   students from the Department of Chemistry at California State
   University, Stanislaus have worked on several hands-on activities with
   fifth-eighth grade students at university laboratories and with
   second-fourth grade students at elementary school classrooms.
   Undergraduate students have learned to simplify difficult Chemistry
   concepts for the general audience, while they have encouraged young
   students to develop a positive attitude toward science and the pursuit
   of higher education in the STEM fields. In addition, undergraduate
   students involved in these activities are more motivated to succeed in
   their own academic career. This article explains how we have
   accomplished the development of Chemistry outreach activities and how
   undergraduate students are involved in the preparation of these events.},

Title = {Prediction models to identify individuals at risk of metabolic syndrome
   who are unlikely to participate in a health intervention program},

Abstract = {Objectives: Since the launch of a nationwide general health check-up and
   instruction program in Japan in 2008, interest in strategies to improve
   implementation of the program based on predictive analytics has grown.
   We investigated the performance of prediction models developed to
   identify individuals classified as ``requiring instruction{''}
   (high-risk) who were unlikely to participate in a health intervention
   program.
   Methods: Data were obtained from one large health insurance union in
   Japan. The study population included individuals who underwent at least
   one general health check-up between 2008 and 2013 and were identified as
   ``requiring instruction{''} in 2013. We developed three prediction
   models based on the gradient boosted trees (GBT), random forest (RF),
   and logistic regression (LR) algorithms using machine-learning
   techniques and compared the areas under the curve (AUC) of the developed
   models with those of two conventional methods The aim of the models was
   to identify at-risk individuals who were unlikely to participate in the
   instruction program in 2013 after being classified as requiring
   instruction at their general health check-up that year.
   Results: At first we performed the analysis using data without multiple
   imputation. The AUC values for the GBT, RF, and LR prediction models and
   conventional methods: 1, and 2 were 0.893 (95\%CI: 0.882-0.905), 0.889
   (95\%CI: 0.877-0.901), 0.885 (95\%CI: 0.872-0.897), 0.784 (95\%CI:
   0.767-0.800), and 0.757 (95\%CI: 0.741-0.773), respectively.
   Subsequently, we performed the analysis using data after multiple
   imputation. The AUC values for the GBT, RF, and LR prediction models and
   conventional methods: 1, and 2 were 0.894 (95\%CI: 0.882-0.906), 0.889
   (95\%CI: 0.887- 0.901), 0.885 (95\%CI: 0.872-0.898), 0.784 (95\%CI:
   0.767-0.800), and 0.757 (95\%CI: 0.741-0.773), respectively. In both
   analyses, the GBT model showed the highest AUC among that of other
   models, and statistically significant difference were found in
   comparison with the LR model, conventional method 1, and conventional
   method 2.
   Conclusion:The prediction models using machine-learning techniques
   outperformed existing conventional methods: for predicting participation
   in the instruction program among participants identified as ``requiring
   instruction{''} (high-risk).},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of a professional
   development (PD) program on teachers' implementation of the Teaching
   Personal and Social Responsibility (TPSR) model, and to identify the
   characteristics of PD that influence teaching practice. The participants
   were six elementary school teachers and 12 students, and the data were
   collected from interviews with the teachers and students, observations,
   and teachers' reflective journal entries. The findings revealed that PD
   enhanced the fidelity of implementation in terms of improving structural
   adherence, facilitating coherent instructional delivery, and making the
   students more active and responsible. The PD also helped the teachers to
   adapt the model by developing cultural differentiation strategies,
   modifying existing components, and extending the implementation of the
   TPSR through connection with other subjects or activities. The teachers
   found that the PD facilitated their implementation of TPSR by giving
   them common goals, empowering them as creators of knowledge, and
   providing a continuous and authentic learning experience.},

Title = {y ``Residents as Teachers{''} Workshop Improves Knowledge, Confidence,
   and Feedback Skills for General Surgery Residents},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Surgical residents receive limited formal training in
   education, yet they are expected to teach medical students and one
   another. A ``Residents as Teachers{''} curriculum was developed and
   implemented to improve residents' knowledge of educational strategies,
   confidence in teaching abilities, and quality of feedback given to
   learners.
   DESIGN: A 6-hour workshop was delivered at an academic general surgery
   residency program. It included 3 interactive sessions: ``Teaching on the
   wards{''}, ``How to give and receive feedback{''}, and ``Teaching in the
   operating room (OR){''}. Pre- and postsession surveys were administered
   to evaluate participants' knowledge and confidence regarding teaching
   skills. Standard statistical analyses were used to compare pre- and
   postcurriculum scores.
   SETTING: General surgery residents at Case Western Reserve
   University/University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center Program
   attended a 6-hour educational seminar entitled ``Residents as
   Teachers{''}. Three attending surgeons with expertise in surgical
   education administered the curriculum. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four
   residents completed the course and surveys (5 PGY-5s, 6 PGY-4s, 4
   PGY-3s, 5 PGY-2s, and 4 PGY-1s). RESULTS: On a 5-point Likert scale,
   residents' self-rating of teaching skills (pre = 1.8, post = 3.04, p <
   0.001) and understanding of adult learning (pre = 1.88, post = 4.42, p <
   0.001) improved significantly. The greatest gain was in describing
   effective strategies for teaching in the OR (pre= 1.75, post= 4.38, p <
   0.001). Residents reported improved understanding of effective feedback
   characteristics (pre = 2.5, post = 4.33, p < 0.001), and felt more
   prepared to provide feedback to learners (pre= 2.73, post = 3.17, p =
   0.01). Scores on 5 of 10 knowledge-based questions significantly
   improved following the intervention. All participants agreed or strongly
   agreed that the workshop improved the program's surgical education
   curriculum (mean score 4.42 of 5).
   CONCLUSIONS: A ``Residents as Teachers{''} workshop improved resident
   confidence in teaching and feedback skills, particularly for
   intraoperative instruction, and improved knowledge in the 3 specific
   educational domains included in the session. (C) 2020 Association of

Abstract = {University assessment is in the midst of transformation. Assessments are
   no longer designed solely to determine that students can remember and
   regurgitate lecture content, nor in order to rank students to aid with
   some future selection process. Instead, assessments are expected to
   drive, support, and enhance learning and to contribute to student
   self-assessment and development of skills and attributes for a lifetime
   of learning. While traditional purposes of certifying achievement and
   determining readiness to progress remain important, these new
   expectations for assessment can create tensions in assessment design,
   selection, and deployment. With the recognition of these tensions, three
   contemporary approaches to assessment in medical education are
   described. These approaches include careful consideration of the
   educational impact of assessment-before, during (test or recall enhanced
   learning) and after assessments; development of student (and staff)
   assessment literacy; and planning of cohesive systems of assessment
   (with a range of assessment tools) designed to assess the various
   competencies demanded of future graduates. These approaches purposefully
   straddle the cross purposes of assessment in modern health professions
   education. The implications of these models are explored within the
   context of medical education and then linked with contemporary work in
   the anatomical sciences in order to highlight current synergies and
   potential future innovations when using evidence-informed strategies to
   boost the educational impact of assessments.},

Abstract = {Background In a flipped classroom (FC) model, blended learning is used
   to increase student engagement and learning by having students finish
   their readings at home and work on problem-solving with tutors during
   class time. Evidence-based medicine (EBM) integrates clinical experience
   and patient values with the best evidence-based research to inform
   clinical decisions. To implement a FC and EBM, students require
   sufficient information acquisition and problem-solving skills.
   Therefore, a FC is regarded as an excellent teaching model for tutoring
   EBM skills. However, the effectiveness of a FC for teaching EBM
   competency has not been rigorously investigated in pre-clinical
   educational programs. In this study, we used an innovative FC model in a
   pre-clinical EBM teaching program. Methods FC's teaching was compared
   with a traditional teaching model by using an assessment framework of
   prospective propensity score matching, which reduced the potential
   difference in basic characteristics between the two groups of students
   on 1:1 ratio. For the outcome assessments of EBM competency, we used an
   analysis of covariance and multivariate linear regression analysis to
   investigate comparative effectiveness between the two teaching models. A
   total of 90 students were prospectively enrolled and assigned to the
   experimental or control group using 1:1 propensity matching. Results
   Compared with traditional teaching methods, the FC model was associated
   with better learning outcomes for the EBM competency categories of Ask,
   Acquire, Appraise, and Apply for both written and oral tests at the end
   of the course (all p-values< 0.001). In particular, the ``appraise{''}
   skill for the written test (6.87 +/- 2.20) vs. (1.47 +/- 1.74), p <
   0.001), and the ``apply{''} skill for the oral test (7.34 +/- 0.80 vs.
   3.97 +/- 1.24, p < 0.001) had the biggest difference between the two
   groups. Conclusions After adjusting for a number of potential confunding
   factors, our study findings support the effectiveness of applying an FC
   teaching model to cultivate medical students' EBM literacy.},

   reflection, and adaptation to change. Nurses, along with an educator,
   can construct knowledge with the same strategies they will use
   professionally.
   Purpose: To evaluate the knowledge, skills, and attitudes associated of
   postgraduate nurses on gender-based violence before and after a
   reflection-based training program with dramatized problem-videos. The
   secondary objectives were to evaluate the knowledge in the activation of
   protocols, skills, and attitudes in the management of women who are
   victims of gender-based violence, the consolidation of learning, and the
   applicability to the workplace.
   Methods: Pre-post quasi-experimental study without a control group. A
   specifically validated and designed instrument was utilized to evaluate
   the dimensions of knowledge, skills, and attitudes when facing
   gender-based violence, before and after the training sessions, along
   with additional questions to assess if the participants possessed better
   tools to address gender-based violence.
   Results: The difference between the pre and post-tests was statistically
   significant for the dimensions knowledge, skills, and attitude (p <
   0.05), with a smaller effect size in the dimensions skills and attitude.
   Also, high scores were observed in the consolidation of learning and
   applicability to the workplace.
   Conclusion: Reflection-based training with dramatized problem-videos
   improved the acquisition of tools necessary for the detection and
   management of gender-based violence of nurses.},

Title = {Web 2.0 Blended Learning to Introduce e-Business Contents in Engineering
   Education: a Pilot Case Study in Jordan},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {30},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {543-559},
Abstract = {Blended Learning (BL) is considered a promising pedagogical approach.
   Some researches demonstrated that students' satisfaction is higher for
   BL courses compared to completely online or face-to-face (F2F) courses.
   Moreover, the explosion of web 2.0 tools and the success of the
   ``read-write Web{''} are reconfiguring the individual and collaborative
   blended learning processes. Based on this assumption, this paper
   investigates the effectiveness of web 2.0 BL for the design and delivery
   of a pilot course on e-business topics. Two experimentations have been
   organized involving undergraduates engineering students of the
   University of Jordan. According to the obtained results assessing
   students' reaction, learning and behaviour, the BL model proposed in the
   article revealed more effective than traditional F2F learning. A survey
   conducted at the end of the course also showed that students were
   satisfied with the pedagogical approach, and their academic achievements
   were also significantly improved. Findings demonstrate that successful
   BL programs require innovative curriculum design strategy based on new
   principles such as: a) the involvement of heterogeneous stakeholders in
   the course's design phase; b) the focus on competence development rather
   than on knowledge transfer; c) the choice of team work as an additional
   component to evaluate individual students' performances; d) presence of
   remote and F2F interactions among peers and between teachers and
   students; e) the usage of web 2.0 tools as enablers of collaborative
   learning processes and social networking; f) continuous tutoring both
   for content and technological issues. These findings can help
   engineering colleges and universities to design and offer more effective
   learning courses.},

Title = {Choosing YouTube Videos for Self-Directed Learning},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {51155-51166},
Abstract = {YouTube provides a vital source for self-directed learning. YouTube's
   search engine, however, ranks videos according to popularity, relevancy,
   and view history rather than quality. The effect of this ranking on
   learners' behavior and experience is not clear: Do learners tend to
   choose from the top of the returned search list? Does the choosing
   behavior affect their learning? Is the type of sought knowledge relevant
   in this process? To answer these questions, we conducted two experiments
   with sophomore-level students in electrical and computer engineering
   programs. The students were asked to learn about two new topics by
   watching YouTube videos of their choice. The first topic conveys
   procedural knowledge about using the Quine McCluskey algorithm for
   minimizing logical functions. The second topic relates to the concept of
   the set-reset latch. In each learning session, the students had to
   report their watching behavior and experience by responding to an online
   questionnaire as well as to solve a problem related to the respective
   topic. The results show a clear tendency to choose from the top of the
   returned list. However, students' performance in problem-solving was
   found to be uncorrelated with the choosing behavior. These results were
   similar for procedural and conceptual learning although the students'
   performance in solving the conceptual problem was significantly lower.
   These findings indicate that university students who seek YouTube for
   self-directed learning can freely choose from the top of the returned
   search list without concern. There is no evident harm in doing so.
   However, students need to be thoughtful when using YouTube for
   conceptual learning. They should use different strategies such as
   watching multiple videos, selecting videos with higher viewer ratings,
   or watching videos with related procedural knowledge to support the
   learning of new concepts.},

Title = {The effect of professional portfolio learning on nursing students'
   professional self-concepts in geriatric adult internship: a-
   quasi-experimental study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {BackgroundProfessional self-concept is one of the important outcomes of
   nursing professionalism. There is a lack of adequately planned
   curriculum may limit nursing students' practical knowledge, skills and
   professional self-concept in providing comprehensive geriatric-adult
   care and promoting nursing professionalism. Professional portfolio
   learning strategy has allowed nursing students to continue professional
   development and enhance nursing professionalism in professional clinical
   practice. However, there is little empirical evidence in nursing
   education to support the use of professional portfolios in blended
   learning modality among internship nursing students. Therefore, this
   study aims to examine the effect of the blended professional portfolio
   learning on professional self-concept among undergraduate nursing
   students during Geriatric-Adult internship.MethodsA quasi-experimental
   study two-group pre-test post-test design. A total of 153 eligible
   senior undergraduate students completed the study (76 in the
   intervention group and 77 in the control group). They were recruited
   from two Bachelor of Sciences in Nursing (BSN) cohorts from nursing
   schools at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (MUMS), in Iran, in
   January 2020. Randomization was undertaken at the level of school via a
   simple lottery method. The intervention group received the professional
   portfolio learning program as a holistic blended learning modality,
   though the control group received conventional learning during
   professional clinical practice. A demographic questionnaire and the
   Nurse Professional Self-concept questionnaire were used for data
   collection.ResultsThe findings imply the effectiveness of the blended
   PPL program. Results of Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) analysis
   was indicated significantly improved professional self-concept
   development and its dimensions (self-esteem, caring, staff relation,
   communication, knowledge, leadership) with high effect size. The results
   of the between-group comparison for professional self-concept and its
   dimensions at different time points (pre, post and follow up test)
   showed a significant difference between groups at post-test and follow
   up test (p < 0.05),while at pre-test there was no important
   dissimilarity between two groups (p > 0.05).The results of within-group
   comparison for both control and intervention showed that there were
   significant differences in professional self-concept and for all its
   dimensions across the time from pre-test to post-test and follow-up (p <
   0.05), and also from post-test to follow-up it was significant (p <
   0.05) for both groups.ConclusionThis professional portfolio learning
   program demonstrates as an innovative and holistic blended
   teaching-learning approach to improve professional self-concept during
   professional clinical practice among undergraduate nursing students. It
   appears that the use of a blended designed of professional portfolio can
   promote a link between theory and the advancement of geriatric adult
   nursing internship practice. The data obtained from the present study
   can be useful for nursing education to evaluate and redesign a
   curriculum for development of nursing professionalism as a quality
   improvement process and groundwork to develop new models of
   teaching-learning and assessment.},

Title = {Learning Label Preserving Binary Codes for Multimedia Retrieval: A
   General Approach},

Abstract = {Learning-based hashing has been researched extensively in the past few
   years due to its great potential in fast and accurate similarity search
   among huge volumes of multimedia data. In this article, we present a
   novel multimedia hashing framework, called Label Preserving Multimedia
   Hashing (LPMH) for multimedia similarity search. In LPMH, a general
   optimization method is used to learn the joint binary codes of multiple
   media types by explicitly preserving semantic label information.
   Compared with existing hashing methods which are typically developed
   under and thus restricted to some specific objective functions, the
   proposed optimization strategy is not tied to any specific loss function
   and can easily incorporate bit balance constraints to produce
   well-balanced binary codes. Specifically, our formulation leads to a set
   of Binary Integer Programming (BIP) problems that have exact solutions
   both with and without bit balance constraints. These problems can be
   solved extremely fast and the solution can easily scale up to
   large-scale datasets. In the hash function learning stage, the boosted
   decision trees algorithm is utilized to learn multiple media-specific
   hash functions that can map heterogeneous data sources into a
   homogeneous Hamming space for cross-media retrieval. We have
   comprehensively evaluated the proposed method using a range of
   large-scale datasets in both single-media and cross-media retrieval
   tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that LPMH is competitive
   with state-of-the-art methods in both speed and accuracy.},

Title = {Practical strategies to enhance resident engagement in clinical quality
   improvement},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 14},
Abstract = {Background Engaging residents in meaningful quality improvement (QI) is
   difficult. Challenges include competing demands, didactics which lack
   connection to meaningful work, suboptimal experiential learning, unclear
   accountability, absence of timely and relevant data, and lack of faculty
   coaches and role models. Various strategies to address these challenges
   for engagement have been described, but not as a unified approach. This
   paper describes a bundle of practical strategies to address common
   challenges to resident engagement in QI, illustrated through the
   experience of one residency education program. Methods 62 categorical
   residents in the University of Missouri Internal Medicine residency
   participated in a longitudinal QI curriculum integrated into residency
   clinic assignments with dedicated QI work sessions and brief
   just-in-time didactics with mentorship from faculty coaches. Residents
   completed at least two PDSA (Plan-Do-Study-Act) cycles for their
   projects. The experience included clear expectations and tools for
   accountability. Project criteria included importance to patients,
   residents, and the institution. Residents had access to data related to
   their own practice. A pre-post survey asked residents to self-assess
   their level of interest and engagement in QI on a 5-point Likert scale,
   with 1 = least desired and 5 = most desired result. Data were analyzed
   by paired t-test. Results All 62 residents participated in the program
   as members of ten QI teams. 40/62 residents completed both pre- and
   post-surveys. Items related to self-assessment of QI in clinical work
   all changed in the desired direction: likelihood of participation (3.7
   to 4.1, p = 0.03), frequency of QI use (3.3 to 3.9, p = 0.001), and
   opinion about using QI in clinical work (3.9 to 4.0, p = 0.21). Resident
   assessment of QI priority in clinical work did not change. Conclusions
   We implemented a practical strategies bundle to overcome common
   challenges to successfully engaging residents in clinical quality
   improvement. These strategies included QI work integrated into routine
   clinical assignments, just-in-time didactics, experiential learning with
   clear expectations and strategic project selection, timely and pertinent
   data from the residents' own practice, and real-time faculty coaching.},

Title = {How Medical Students Learn From Residents in the Workplace: A
   Qualitative Study},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {89},
Number = {3},
Pages = {490-496},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Purpose To explore what third-year medical students learn from residents
   and which teaching strategies are used by excellent resident teachers in
   their interactions with students in the clinical workplace environment.
   Method In this multi-institutional qualitative study between January and
   March 2012, the authors conducted focus groups with medical students who
   were midway through their third year. Qualitative analysis was used to
   identify themes.
   Results Thirty-seven students participated. Students contributed 228
   comments related to teaching methods used by residents. The authors
   categorized these into 20 themes within seven domains: role-modeling,
   focusing on teaching, creating a safe learning environment, providing
   experiential learning opportunities, giving feedback, setting
   expectations, and stimulating learning. Role-modeling, the most
   frequently classified method of teaching in this study, was not included
   in three popular Resident-as-Teacher (RAT) models. Strategies including
   offering opportunities for safe practice, involving students in the
   team, and providing experiential learning opportunities were not
   emphasized in these models either. Almost 200 comments representing the
   knowledge and skills students learned from residents were categorized
   into 33 themes within nine domains: patient care, communication,
   navigating the system, adaptability, functioning as a student/resident,
   lifelong learning, general comments, career/professional development,
   and medical content. Most of these areas are not emphasized in popular
   RAT models.
   Conclusions Residents serve as critically important teachers of students
   in the clinical workplace. Current RAT models are based largely on the
   teaching behaviors of faculty. The content and teaching strategies
   identified by students in this study should serve as the foundation for
   future RAT program development.},

Abstract = {Appropriate terminology is essential for successful communication among
   health professionals. However, students have traditionally been
   encouraged to learn terminology by rote memorization and recall,
   strategies that students try to avoid. The use of crossword puzzles as a
   learning tool has been evaluated in other education disciplines, but not
   for terminology related to veterinary science. Hence, the objective of
   this study was to test whether crossword puzzles might be an effective
   aid to learning veterinary terminology. Forty-two first-year students
   enrolled in a Bachelor of Veterinary Science program were randomly
   divided into two groups and their previous knowledge of veterinary terms
   tested. One group received a list of 30 terms with their definitions.
   The other group received the same list plus six specially designed
   puzzles incorporating these 30 terms. After 50 minutes, both groups
   completed a post-intervention test and the results were compared
   statistically. The results showed that the students using the crossword
   puzzles performed better in the post-intervention test, correctly
   retaining more terms than the students using only rote learning. In
   addition, qualitative data, gathered through an electronic survey and
   focus group discussions, revealed a positive attitude among students
   toward the use of crossword puzzles.},

Abstract = {Persons excluded due to ethnicity or race (PEERs) leave STEM at
   disproportionate rates; therefore, efforts to engage undergraduate PEERs
   are critical to creating a diverse STEM workforce. Through a Howard
   Hughes Medical Institute funded Inclusive Excellence grant (HHMI-IE),
   the REALISE (REALizing Inclusive Science Excellence) program was
   developed with the goal to increase student retention and success. As
   part of this project, an extensive faculty development program,
   including a backward course design module, workshops on microaggressions
   and implicit bias, and teamwork training, was created to help faculty
   implement inclusive pedagogy strategies. There were 33 faculty members
   who participated in the trainings within faculty learning communities
   (FLCs) and were further supported with STEM-Education (STEM-Ed) reading
   groups, faculty mixers, minigrants, and engagement from the Center for
   Innovative Teaching and Learning (CITL). Evaluation of 10 faculty
   members' change narratives and reflective prompts revealed that
   low-stakes opportunities such as STEMEd reading groups had the most
   influence for instituting learner-centered classroom practices, and the
   workshops on microaggressions and implicit biases prompted faculty to
   create opportunities to build respectful relationships with students.
   Here, we share lessons learned from our program evaluation so that
   others can successfully implement inclusive pedagogy in chemistry.},

Title = {Innovative strategies: Increased engagement and synthesis in online
   advanced practice nursing education},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},

Abstract = {Introduction: The struggle to maintain quality education in the online
   environment has brought about the redesign for the family nurse
   practitioner courses.
   Background: The family nurse practitioner program uses graduate Health
   Education Systems Incorporated examination as a quality indicator and
   program benchmark. A downward trend in Health Education Systems
   Incorporated examination scores stimulated a need for change. Two
   strategies were implemented to enhance engagement and improve synthesis
   of clinical information. Case-based learning and gamification involves
   the use of game thinking and game mechanics in non-game contexts to
   engage users in solving problems while the case-based discussions act as
   formative assessment tool, providing information on student's progress
   and development.
   Objectives: To assess the implementation of innovative strategies on the
   Health Education Systems Incorporated examination scores and to enhance
   students engagement and synthesis of clinical information.
   Method: Case presentations were created in the Learning Management
   System an online program, for every module. Interwoven throughout the
   module are various game elements. The game elements include voluntary
   participation with immediate feedback that can be both positive and
   negative and provides a social connection. The student has the freedom
   to fail and the freedom to choose without significant repercussions.
   Results: The results showed examination scores increased significantly.
   Using a one-way analysis of variance to compare Health Education Systems
   Incorporated examination scores between semester cohorts of students,
   followed by a post hoc pairwise comparison a statistically significant
   difference (p < .001) between previous semesters was identified.
   Conclusion: Although there are many approaches for online learning,
   using case presentations can mirror different social and cultural
   situations to challenge the learner. Case-based discussion and
   gamification strategies are effective in engaging students in a
   challenging environment. Student responded positively to case-base
   presentation with game elements. Using this approach is designed to
   challenge and add value to the learning experience.},

Abstract = {In this information era, there is an urgent need for tighter integration
   of bioinformatics and experimental biology. The enormous amount of data
   generated by biological experiments calls for extensive computational
   analysis. Many bioinformatics textbooks at present mainly focus on
   theories, which hinders the vigorous development of scientific research.
   As a result, most students are simply familiar with the bioinformatics
   theories but lack the opportunity to put them into practice. Here, we
   present our bioinformatics docking project conducted during the
   self-isolation period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Five students used the
   RBD-ACE2 complex as a benchmark to conduct a systematic comparison of
   several open-source online molecular docking programs. The virus surface
   spike protein mediates the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into human
   cells by binding to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
   (ACE2), through its receptor-binding domain (RBD). Through docking and
   comparing predicted structures to the crystal structure, students gained
   the opportunity to practice different bioinformatics tools independently
   and conduct research collaboratively. It opens a window for students to
   reach out to the state-of-the-art bioinformatics techniques and to keep
   up with the research trends. The online workshop has also proven to be
   an innovative method for bioinformatics teaching. We hope our work can
   inspire other educators to develop strategies to expose undergraduate
   students to modern bioinformatics and turn every temporary difficulty
   into a possible learning opportunity.},

Title = {The Direction Analysis on Trajectory of Fast Neural Network Learning
   Robot},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {125580-125589},
Abstract = {This study is to efficiently apply artificial neural network (ANN) to
   the robotics, so as to provide experimental basis for mobile robots to
   learn the optimal trajectory planning strategy. An algorithm model is
   innovatively proposed based on back propagation neural network (BPNN)
   and reinforcement learning (Q-Learning) by combining the motion space,
   selective strategy, and reward function design. The simulation
   experiment environment is set and the ROS mobile robot is adopted for
   simulation experiments. The algorithm proposed in this study is compared
   with other neural network algorithms from the perspectives of accuracy,
   precision, recall, and F1. It can be found that the accuracy of
   algorithm proposed was at least 5.47\% higher than that of the model
   algorithm proposed by other scholars, and the values of precision,
   recall, and F1 were at least 5.5\% higher. The results show that the
   mobile robot could find the shortest trajectory and the best trajectory
   in a discrete obstacle environment, no matter the more or less the
   discrete obstacles or the large or small the space. Therefore, compared
   to the advanced model algorithms proposed by other scholars in related
   fields, the robot trajectory planning based on the improved BPNN
   combined with Q-Learning constructed in this study could realize better
   results, and can be used in practical applications with robot trajectory
   planning, providing practical value for the field of machine vision.},

   a panel of administrators and faculty members, whose institutions
   offered IPE, funded by the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation, shared best
   collaborative practice models at the American Association of Colleges of
   Pharmacy (AACP) Annual Meeting. These presenters subsequently
   collaborated to write a primer as guidance for other institutions
   interested in successfully implementing and continuously enhancing the
   quality of IPE programs. In this article, these IPE faculty members
   provide a rationale for creating IPE reforms, discuss successful
   strategies for innovative IPE programs, and share lessons learned for
   implementing effective assessment tools. A structure and process for
   determining outcomes of IPE models are presented and strategies for
   exploring shared education opportunities across health professions and
   for integrating top-down and bottom-up methods for IPE programs are
   given.},

Abstract = {(Aim) Multiple sclerosis is a neurological condition that may cause
   neurologic disability. Convolutional neural network can achieve good
   results, but tuning hyperparameters of CNN needs expert knowledge and
   are difficult and time-consuming. To identify multiple sclerosis more
   accurately, this article proposed a new transfer-learning-based
   approach. (Method) DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, and DenseNet-201 neural
   networks were compared. In addition, we proposed the use of a composite
   learning factor (CLF) that assigns different learning factor to three
   types of layers: early frozen layers, middle layers, and late replaced
   layers. {[}low to allocate layers into those three layers remains a
   problem. Hence, four transfer learning settings (viz., Settings A, B, C,
   and D) were tested and compared. A precomputation method was utilized to
   reduce the storage burden and accelerate the program. (Results) We
   observed that DenseNet-201-D (the layers from CP to T3 are frozen, the
   layers of D4 are updated with learning factor of 1, and the final new
   layers of FCL are randomly initialized with learning factor of 10) can
   achieve the best performance. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy
   of DenseNet-201-D was 98.27 +/- 0.58, 98.35 +/- 0.69, and 98.31 +/-
   0.53, respectively. (Conclusion) Our method gives better performances
   than state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, this composite learning
   rate gives superior results to traditional simple learning factor (SLF)
   strategy.},

Abstract = {Background: Transition education is a robust strategy to improve the
   core competency of newly graduated nurses and the quality of clinical
   nursing and ensure people's safety. Limited information about the
   learning objectives and educational content for newly graduated nurses
   in China was available.Objective: Construct the learning objectives and
   educational content for newly graduated nurses based on defined core
   competencies. Design: We used a literature review and the e-Delphi
   method to conduct this study.Settings: Ten tertiary teaching hospitals
   and six nursing schools in Zhejiang Province, China, were
   selected.Participants: Experts (n = 21) were invited to the e-Delphi
   study. Methods: Based on seven competencies from the literature review
   and the research group discussions, we formed an initial set of
   objectives and specific educational content for newly graduated nurses.
   Subsequently, experts provided supportive and modification advice on the
   competencies, objectives, and specific content in the two Delphi rounds.
   The consensus percentage and the weight of each first-level,
   second-level, and third-level item were calculated.Results: Consensus
   was achieved on seven core competencies, 44 learning objectives, and 60
   components of educational content. The positive coefficient of the two
   Delphi rounds was 100 \%, the authority coefficient was 0.83 and 0.87,
   the proportion of experts who made suggestions was 71.40 \%, the
   coefficient of variation (CV) was <0.25 (P < 0.05) except for two items
   and the Kendall coefficient (W) was 0.15-0.48 (P < 0.01).Conclusion: The
   developed objectives and content framework provide a reference for
   implementing systematic and standardized education for newly graduated
   nurses.},

Abstract = {Introduction Relatively little is known about faculty development (FD)
   activities that help participants achieve sustainable behavioral change.
   This qualitative study evaluated the medium- to long-term impact of a FD
   workshop informed by transformative learning (TL) theory. It aimed to
   discover which aspects of FD prompted healthcare professionals (HPs) to
   adopt effective teaching and learning practices. Methods Seventeen
   participants were interviewed between January and July 2020, 7 to 30
   months after the workshop. Purposeful sampling strategies were used to
   collect data and analysis was performed using reflexive thematic
   analysis. Results Four themes were identified: perspectival shift in
   educational practice, re-affirmation of current practices, becoming an
   educator, and valuing FD that accommodates HPs' multiple communities of
   practice (CoPs). Workshop activities foregrounding critical discourse
   and reflection helped participants gain new knowledge and deeper
   understanding of education. TL was likely when participants already
   identified as an educator in addition to their HP identity.
   Additionally, a workplace CoP determined the type and level of support
   affecting HPs' development as educators. Discussion Aspects of FD that
   prompted HPs to adopt effective teaching and learning practices included
   initiatives that catalyzed critical discourse and reflection. Readiness
   for TL is promoted when HPs have a strong educator identity because of
   workplace educator CoPs. Future research could explore effecting
   sustainable post-workshop behavioral change in HPs through the
   strengthening of workplace educator CoPs. To do this, institutions could
   send co-located HPs from different disciplines to the same FD program.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Burnout among general surgery residents is prevalent.
   Guidance on how program directors (PDs) can effectively intervene on
   general surgery resident wellness is lacking. In this study, we explore
   how PDs learn about burnout among their residents and support their
   well-being.
   DESIGN: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with PDs. Interviews
   were transcribed and coded by study team dyads who utilized an inductive
   coding approach, and then reconciled via consensus. Interpretive
   description was the qualitative analytical method.
   SETTING: Program tours to 15 general surgery programs during the
   exploratory phase of the SECOND Trial.
   PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen general surgery PDs.
   RESULTS: PDs identified the utility of contextual information in
   understanding resident wellness and implementing program-specific
   resident wellness initiatives. Three themes relating to PD awareness of
   resident burnout and well-being were identified: (1) PDs used
   conventional and novel methods to collect data from multiple information
   sources, including residents, faculty, staff, institutional
   representatives, and anonymous parties. (2) These contextualized data
   inspired the development of responsive strategies to effect programmatic
   changes that improved education and wellness. (3) Barriers to acquiring
   and utilizing information exist, requiring careful analysis, creative
   problem solving, as well as persistence and dedication to resident
   wellness.
   CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative analysis of general surgery residency PDs
   yielded insightful knowledge about gathering and responding to
   information to support resident wellness, including successful
   strategies and areas of caution. The experience of these PDs can guide
   others in evaluating their wellness goals and initiatives for their own
   residents. (C) 2022 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

Title = {A survey of cariology teaching in Australia and New Zealand},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {APR 10},
Abstract = {Background: The Australian and New Zealand chapter of the Alliance for a
   Cavity Free Future was launched in 2013 and one of its primary aims was
   to conduct a survey of the local learning and teaching of cariology in
   dentistry and oral health therapy programs.
   Methods: A questionnaire was developed using the framework of the
   European Organisation for Caries Research (ORCA)/Association of Dental
   Education in Europe (ADEE) cariology survey conducted in Europe in 2009.
   The questionnaire was comprised of multiple choice and open-ended
   questions exploring many aspects of the cariology teaching. The survey
   was distributed to the cariology curriculum coordinator of each of the
   21 programs across Australia and New Zealand via Survey Monkey in
   January 2015. Simple analysis of results was carried out with
   frequencies and average numbers of hours collated and open-ended
   responses collected and compiled into tables.
   Results: Seventeen responses from a total of 21 programs had been
   received including 7 Dentistry and 10 Oral Health programs. Key findings
   from the survey were - one quarter of respondents indicated that
   cariology was identified as a specific discipline with their course and
   41\% had a cariology curriculum in written format. With regard to lesion
   detection and caries diagnosis, all of the program coordinators who
   responded indicated that visual/tactile methods and radiographic
   interpretation were recommended with ICDAS also being used by over half
   them. Despite all respondents teaching early caries lesion management
   centred on prevention and remineralisation, many taught operative
   intervention at an earlier stage of lesion depth than current evidence
   supports. Findings showed over 40\% of respondents still teach operative
   intervention for lesions confined to enamel.
   Conclusion: Despite modern theoretical concepts of cariology being
   taught in Australia and New Zealand, they do not appear to be fully
   translated into clinical teaching at the present time.},

Title = {Opportunities for reinforcement learning in stochastic dynamic vehicle
   routing},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& OPERATIONS RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {150},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {There has been a paradigm-shift in urban logistic services in the last
   years; demand for real-time, instant mobility and delivery services
   grows. This poses new challenges to logistic service providers as the
   underlying stochastic dynamic vehicle routing problems (SDVRPs) require
   anticipatory real-time routing actions. The complexity of finding
   efficient routing actions is multiplied by the challenge of evaluating
   such actions with respect to their effectiveness given future dynamism
   and uncertainty. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising tool for
   evaluating actions but it is not designed for searching the complex and
   combinatorial action space. Thus, past work on RL for SDVRP has either
   restricted the action space, that is solving only subproblems by RL and
   everything else by established heuristics, or focused on problems that
   reduce to resource allocation problems. For solving real-world SDVRPs,
   new strategies are required that address the combined challenge of
   combinatorial, constrained action space and future uncertainty, but as
   our findings suggest, such strategies are essentially non-existing. Our
   survey paper shows that past work relied either on action-space
   restriction or avoided routing actions entirely and highlights
   opportunities for more holistic solutions.},

Abstract = {The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) has begun
   the transition to Competency by Design (CBD), a new curricular model for
   residency education that `ensure{[}s] competence, but teaches for
   excellence'. By 2022, all Canadian specialty programs are anticipated to
   have completed the CBD cohort process which includes workshops
   facilitated by a Royal College Clinician Educator. Queen's University in
   Ontario, Canada, was granted approval by the RCPSC to embark upon an
   accelerated path to competency-based medical education (CBME) for all
   our postgraduate specialties. This accelerated path allowed us to take
   an institutional approach for CBME implementation and ensure that all
   specialities were part of a system-wide change. Our unique
   institution-wide approach to CBD is the first of its kind across Canada.
   From both a theoretical and practical perspective we undertook CBME
   using a systems approach that allowed us to build the foundations for
   CBME, implement the change, and plan for sustainability. This has
   created opportunities to bridge and connect the various programs
   involved in the implementation of CBME on Queen's campus. The systems
   approach was an essential part of our strategy to develop a community
   dedicated to ensuring a successful CBME implementation.},

Abstract = {Introduction: The Hedwig von Ameringen Executive Leadership in Academic
   Medicine program (ELAM) is a national professional development program
   for women that includes institutional action projects (IAPs). Although
   benefits of ELAM participation are well documented, the value of the
   IAPs has not been specifically evaluated. We explored the experience of
   ELAM Fellows and leaders from one institution to elucidate how
   institutional factors influence project implementation and outcomes.
   Methods: Fellows and deans participated in semistructured interviews. We
   analyzed the transcripts qualitatively to develop themes and describe
   factors that influenced IAP implementation and outcomes. We used the New
   World Kirkpatrick Model, an updated version of the widely used
   Kirkpatrick model of educational program evaluation, as a framework to
   elucidate how participants applied their leadership learning through
   project work, and to analyze early results of projects that indicated
   institutional impact. Results: Project work had bidirectional impact on
   the fellows in the program and on the institution itself. Project
   enablers included: focusing projects on institutional priorities,
   obtaining sustainable support, and navigating institutional complexity.
   Leading indicators of institutional outcomes included contributions to
   institutional leadership and culture, and mutual enhancement of the
   reputation of the fellow and of the institution. Discussion: By
   examining enablers and barriers for institutionally based projects
   conducted in a national leadership development program, we identified
   the drivers that facilitated application of leadership learning. Leading
   indicators of project outcomes reflected bidirectional impact on fellows
   and the institution, demonstrating outcomes at the highest levels of the
   New World Kirkpatrick Model.},

Abstract = {In recent years increased attention has been placed on physical
   education teachers' use of technology. To date little research has been
   disseminated regarding the strategies physical education teacher
   education (PETE) programs are employing to prepare preservice teacher's
   to use technology. The purpose of this study was to examine the
   influence a technology course had on advancing change in preservice
   teachers. A mixed methods process involving qualitative and quantitative
   data collection was employed. Participants included 12 preservice
   teachers enrolled at a mid-Atlantic university. Data analysis revealed
   four dominant themes emerged from participant data: (1) Increased
   Technological and Technological Pedagogical Knowledge; (2) Persistent
   First- and Second- Order Barriers to Technology Use; (3) Necessity of
   Experiential and Hands-on Learning; and (4) Variation in Warrant for
   Technology Use. Findings illustrate strengths and limitations of a
   technology course in a preservice PETE program as well as its potential
   benefits and impediments to manifesting teacher change.},

Title = {Investigating Students' Experiences and Perceptions of a Flipped and
   Adaptive Online Engineering Thermodynamics Class},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {362-375},
Abstract = {The trend of incorporating flipped learning to create active and
   effective learning environments has become increasingly popular in
   higher education in recent years. Existing research in Science
   Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) suggests that students
   have a positive attitude towards flipped learning. This positive
   attitude strongly correlates to the perceptions of enhanced motivation,
   effective learning, and engagement. However, most of the studies on
   flipped learning in higher education only yield quantitative results.
   Students' perceptions of their experiences of online learning, in
   particular of their motivation in flexible and effective learning
   environments are rarely investigated qualitatively to provide in-depth
   reasoning. Recent online pedagogy has integrated adaptive learning tools
   to meet individual learning needs. This study focused on both flipped
   and adaptive learning strategies implemented in an online thermodynamics
   class. The flipped classroom freed up lecture time for interactive and
   effective online learning activities. This study aimed to interview,
   analyze, and explore underlying themes of college students' perceptions
   and experiences in an online Thermodynamics class using flipped and
   adaptive learning. A total of 14 out of 54 students volunteered for a
   semi-structured interview. Students from the Students Assessing Teaching
   and Learning program were trained to conduct the individual interviews
   and transcribe the recording for analysis. Three researchers analyzed
   the data using thematic analysis. The results indicate that flipped
   learning enhances the students' learning experience and perceptions of
   learning effectiveness, ownership, and motivation. Nevertheless,
   applying adaptive learning with predesigned learning algorithms can
   cause student frustration. Through examination of the three
   psychological needs of the self-determination theory, adaptive learning
   can be perceived as a positive experience if a student's extrinsic
   motives align well with his needs and values. The qualitative findings
   of this study not only demonstrate the effectiveness of modern learning
   technologies in an engineering course, but also provide a foundation for
   future pedagogical design.},

Title = {Adaptive Optimal Control of CVCF Inverters With Uncertain Load: An
   Adaptive Dynamic Programming Approach},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {89276-89286},
Abstract = {This paper proposed a data-driven adaptive optimal control approach for
   CVCF (constant voltage, constant frequency) inverter based on
   reinforcement learning and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). Different
   from existing literature, the load is treated as a dynamic uncertainty
   and a robust optimal state-feedback controller is proposed. The
   stability of the inverter-load system has been strictly analyzed. In
   order to obtain accurate output current differential signal, this paper
   designs a tracking differentiator. It is ensured that the tracking error
   asymptotically converges to zero through the proposed output-feedback
   controllers. A standard proportional integral controller and linear
   active disturbance rejection control strategy are also designed for the
   purpose of comparison. The simulation results show that the proposed
   controller has inherent robustness and does not require retuning with
   different applications.},

Title = {Clinical supervisors' perspectives of factors influencing clinical
   learning experience of nursing students from culturally and
   linguistically diverse backgrounds during placement: A qualitative study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Background: Undergraduate nursing students from culturally and
   linguistically diverse backgrounds experience unique challenges with
   their learning needs during clinical placements. There is limited
   research on clinical supervisors' perspectives of the factors impacting
   clinical learning experience of nursing students from culturally and
   linguistically diverse backgrounds during placement.
   Objectives: This study sought to identify clinical supervisors'
   perspectives of the factors impacting on the clinical learning
   experience of nursing students from culturally and linguistically
   diverse backgrounds and strategies to overcome challenges.
   Design: A qualitative research design using semi-structured interviews.
   Methods: Nine nurses who had experience supervising culturally and
   linguistically diverse nursing students were interviewed as part of data
   collection. Thematic analysis was used for data interpretation.
   Results: Identified factors include: Poor proficiency in English
   language, unfamiliarity with Australian slang and medical terminologies,
   cultural expectations interfering with professional responsibilities,
   incongruity with teaching delivery and learning style, short duration of
   placement, inconsistency with preceptor allocation and inadequate
   preceptor training.
   Conclusion: Recommendations to facilitate the learning of nursing
   students from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds
   on clinical placement include flexibility with assessments, modifying
   teaching styles according to learning needs, providing appropriate
   orientation, creating a welcoming environment, providing consistency
   with allocation of preceptors, and providing appropriate training for
   preceptors. Inconsistency in preceptor allocation was reported to have a
   negative influence on CALD student learning. A collaborative approach
   between Universities and the health care settings is essential in
   assisting clinical supervisors to address the unique learning needs of
   nursing students from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds
   while on clinical placement.},

Abstract = {To address the challenge of overwhelming data inherent in classroom
   lesson videos, this study proposed a visual learning analytics (VLA)
   approach to video-based teacher professional development (TPD). Using a
   two-year experimental design, 46 secondary mathematics teachers were
   divided randomly into a treatment group (N = 24) and a control group (N
   = 22) to learn about and integrate academically productive talk into
   their teaching. The treatment teachers participated in a VLA-supported
   TPD program, while the control teachers participated in conventional
   knowledge-based workshops. Results show that teachers in the treatment
   group had more positive beliefs and higher self-efficacy in the
   post-test and delayed-post-test, while the control group improved, but
   not significantly, in their beliefs about the usefulness of classroom
   talk. In addition, although the control group made a significant
   improvement in their self-efficacy in guiding classroom talk in the
   post-test, this improvement was not sustained to the delayed post-test.
   Moreover, the coding of classroom teaching behaviour revealed that
   teachers in the treatment group relative to the control group
   significantly increased their use of academically productive talk in the
   post-test lessons to encourage the students' elaboration, reasoning, and
   thinking with others in the classroom. The results suggest that, while
   attending knowledge-based workshops had, to some degree, positive
   effects on the control teachers' beliefs and self-efficacy, these
   effects were not sustainable over time. In contrast, the use of visual
   learning analytics to support the treatment group's reflection on the
   classroom data not only had significant and sustained effects on the
   teachers' beliefs and self-efficacy but also significantly influenced
   their actual classroom teaching behaviour. Implications for designing
   VLA to support teacher learning and professional development are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Critical thinking is central to the function of health care
   professionals. However, this topic is not explicitly taught or assessed
   within current programs, yet the need is greater than ever, in an era of
   information explosion, spiraling health care costs, and increased
   understanding about metacognition. To address the importance of teaching
   critical thinking in health professions education, the Shapiro Institute
   for Education and Research and the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation jointly
   sponsored the Millennium Conference 2011 on Critical Thinking. Summary:
   Teams of physician and nurse educators were selected through an
   application process. Attendees proposed strategies for integrating
   principles of critical thinking more explicitly into health professions
   curricula. Working in interprofessional, multi-institutional groups,
   participants tackled questions about teaching, assessment, and faculty
   development. Deliberations were summarized into consensus statements.
   Conclusions: Educational leaders participated in a structured dialogue
   about the enhancement of critical thinking in health professions
   education and recommend strategies to teach critical thinking.},

Abstract = {We present a novel multimodal query expansion strategy, based on genetic
   programming (GP), for image search in visually-oriented e-commerce
   applications. Our GP-based approach aims at both: learning to expand
   queries with multimodal information and learning to compute the
   ``best{''} ranking for the expanded queries. However, different from
   previous work, the query is only expressed in terms of the visual
   content, which brings several challenges for this type of application.
   In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we have collected
   two datasets containing images of clothing products taken from different
   online shops. Experimental results indicate that our method is an
   effective alternative for improving the quality of image search results
   when compared to a genetic programming system based only on visual

Abstract = {The majority of creativity enrichment research has focused on creative
   skills pertaining to originality which is assessed by divergent thinking
   tests. This study aimed to explore a new-paradigm for creativity
   enhancement-improving creativity through the FACE (Feedback, Aesthetic
   experience, Creative design, and Evaluation of designed products)
   computer-based training program in which aesthetic experience and 3-D
   creative design were incorporated. Moreover, possible moderators such as
   emotional creativity (EC) and desire for aesthetics (DA) were
   investigated during the training. In concurrence with these endeavors,
   76 college students participated in a control-group experimental design
   study investigating the effectiveness of the FACE training; it was
   invented to promote cognitive aesthetic enhancement and improve creative
   performance on a 3-D coffee shop design. In addition, inventories
   regarding emotional creativity (EC) and desire for aesthetics (DA) were
   employed. The findings suggest that the employed training program
   enhanced college students' aesthetic understanding, and further improved
   their creativity through both conscious and unconscious processes.
   Notably, training that included constructive feedback led to better
   learning effects than the condition that included informational
   feedback. Furthermore, emotional creativity (EC) and desire for
   aesthetics (DA) played moderating roles during the learning process of
   creativity. This study provides a new archetype for improving creativity
   and the results support the possibility and importance of integrating
   aesthetics and creativity enhancement in computer based learning systems
   for modern educational methods.},

Abstract = {The ideal of self-paced learning, which was introduced nearly 50 years
   ago by Keller in his Personalized System of Instruction (PSI), has not
   yet been widely adopted. In spite of its perceived promise of helping
   students to learn at the speed aligned to their individual backgrounds,
   motivation, and skills, PSI has been challenging to implement.
   University teaching practice with weekly plans means that instructors
   expect students to learn at the same pace. Against this backdrop, this
   paper reports experiences from deploying PSI in multiple offerings of an
   introductory programming course at a Scandinavian university over five
   years. These include variations, such as a buddy system, rightsizing
   modules, encouraging pacing, alternative targets, intermediate
   milestones, active coaching, and time management, all primarily aimed at
   overcoming a key concern associated with PSI, namely, procrastination.
   The lessons associated with each are described with a view to providing
   fellow instructors with strategies and options that they can consider
   for implementing PSI into introductory programming courses.},

Title = {Proactive machine learning-based solution for advanced manageability of
   multi-persona mobile computing},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {80},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Latest mobile virtualization techniques have opened the door for
   multi-persona mobility to overcome security and privacy concerns of
   bring-your-own devices practice. Multi-persona allows a physical device
   to co-host multiple virtual phones with impenetrable walls among them.
   However, physical resources should be always enough to support virtual
   instances and applications needs without performance degradation or
   system crash. Though computation offloading can augment devices
   resources, yet some applications are not offloadable. Additionally, idle
   applications and virtual environments impose high overhead on the
   device. Through machine learning, this work predicts future context and
   resource needs of currently running virtual environments and potential
   future active ones. It provides advanced manageability strategies,
   formulated in an optimization model, which appropriately turn off
   applications and switch off virtual environments to release device
   resources when needed. A dynamic programming algorithm is advocated to
   find the adequate strategies. Extensive experiments conducted
   demonstrate the efficiency of our proposition. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Voices from undergraduate students and faculty members regarding the
   status and challenges of baccalaureate nursing education in Myanmar: A
   qualitative study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {109},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Objectives: To clarify the present status and challenges of nursing
   education in a baccalaureate degree program in Myanmar.
   Design: A qualitative descriptive design using focus group interviews.
   Participants: Undergraduate nursing students and faculty members from
   the University of Nursing in Myanmar.
   Methods: Focus group interviews were separately conducted for each group
   of undergraduate students, and junior and senior faculty members. The
   interview guide for the students was about their perceptions and
   requests regarding their nursing education. For the faculty members, the
   interview guide was about their current perceptions and challenges
   regarding nursing education. Each group interview took about 60 min.
   Results: Eight undergraduate students, eight junior faculty members, and
   six senior faculty members were eligible to participate. The
   undergraduate students voiced their requests for improvement in teaching
   methods. They described their struggles and learning process from their
   clinical placement experiences, as well as their distress under the
   present educational environment. The faculty members described their
   perceptions and challenges regarding inventiveness in teaching methods,
   challenges in conducting clinical placements, lack of educational
   devices and facilities, and innovation requirements in the faculty
   organization and system.
   Conclusion: The present status of nursing education in a baccalaureate
   degree program in Myanmar reflects ongoing serious challenges in
   undergraduate nursing education as expressed by both undergraduate
   students and faculty members. Their voices echo a pressing need to
   implement alternative methods of nursing education for better academic
   outcome. Moreover, continuing education is realized as crucial for
   capacity building and professional development of faculty members.},

Title = {Attitudes toward simulation-based learning in nursing students: An
   application of Q methodology},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {34},

Abstract = {SBL is a highly advanced educational method that promotes
   technical/non-technical skills, increases team competency, and increases
   health care team interaction in a safe health care environment with no
   potential for harm to the patient. Even though students may experience
   the same simulation, their reactions are not necessarily uniform. This
   study aims at identifying the diversely perceived attitudes of
   undergraduate nursing students toward simulation-based learning. This
   study design was utilized using a Q methodology, which analyzes the
   subjectivity of each type of attitude. Data were collected from 22
   undergraduate nursing students who had an experience of simulation-based
   learning before going to the clinical setting. The 45 selected
   Q-statements from each of 22 participants were classified into the shape
   of a normal distribution using a 9-point scale. The collected data was
   analyzed using the pc-QUANL program. The results revealed two discrete
   groups of students toward simulation-based learning: `adventurous
   immersion' and `constructive criticism'. The findings revealed that
   teaching and learning strategies based on the two factors of attitudes
   could beneficially contribute to the customization of simulation-based
   learning. In nursing education and clinical practice, teaching and
   learning strategies based on types I and II can be used to refine an
   alternative learning approach that supports and complements clinical
   practice. Recommendations have been provided based on the findings. (C)

Title = {A Fast and Optimal Smart Home Energy Management System: State-Space
   Approximate Dynamic Programming},

Abstract = {Dynamic programming (DP) can be used to generate the optimal schedules
   of a smart home energy management system (SHEMS), however, it is
   computationally difficult because we have to loop over all the possible
   states, decisions and outcomes. This paper proposes a novel state-space
   approximate dynamic programming (SS-ADP) approach to quickly solve a
   SHEMS problem but with similar solutions as DP. The state-space
   approximations are made using a hierarchical approach, which involves
   clustering and machine learning. The proposed SS-ADP can generate the
   day-ahead value functions quickly without compromising the solution
   quality because it only loops over the necessary state-space. Our
   simulation results showed that the solutions from the SS-ADP approach
   are within 0.8\% of the optimal DP solutions but saves the computational
   time by at least 20\%. The paper also presents a fast real-time control
   strategy under uncertainty using the Bellman optimality condition and
   long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNN). The Bellman
   equation uses the day-ahead value function from the SS-ADP and the
   instantaneous contribution function to make fast real-time decisions.
   The instantaneous contribution is calculated using the PV and load
   predicted using LSTM-RNN, which performs significantly better than the
   widely used persistence method.},

Title = {Supervised-Learning-Based Optimal Thermal Management in an Electric
   Vehicle},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {1290-1302},
Abstract = {Due to the increasing market share of electric vehicles (EVs), the
   optimal thermal management (TM) of batteries has recently received
   significant attention. Optimal battery temperature control is
   challenging, requiring a detailed model and numerous parameters of the
   TM system, which includes fans, pumps, compressors, and heat exchangers.
   This paper proposes a supervised learning strategy for the optimal
   operation of the TM system in an EV. Specifically, for TM subsystems,
   individual artificial neural networks (ANNs) are implemented and trained
   with data obtained under normal EV driving conditions. The ANNs are then
   interconnected based on the physical configuration of the TM system. The
   trained ANNs are replicated using piecewise linear equations, which can
   be explicitly integrated into an optimization problem for optimal TM
   scheduling. This approach enables the application of a mixed-integer
   linear programming solver to the problem, ensuring the optimality of the
   solution. Simulation case studies are performed for the two operating
   modes of the TM system: i.e., integrated and separate modes. The case
   study results demonstrate that the ANN-based model successfully reflects
   the operating characteristics of the TM system, enabling accurate
   battery temperature estimation. The proposed optimal TM strategy using
   the ANN-based model is verified as effective in reducing the total
   energy consumption, while maintaining the battery temperature within an
   acceptable range.},

Title = {The Relationship Between Engineering Students' Achievement Goals,
   Reflection Behaviors, and Learning Outcomes},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {34},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {1634-1643},
Abstract = {Prior studies have shown that students' achievement goals play a key
   role in their learning strategies, decision-making processes, and
   learning outcomes. However, a majority of these studies were conducted
   with undergraduate psychology students. Thus, there is a need to explore
   the role of students' achievement goals on their reflection behaviors
   and learning outcomes in different fields, including engineering
   education. Based on our literature review in engineering education,
   there are a limited number of studies that investigated the relationship
   between achievement goals and students' learning outcomes. Therefore, we
   conducted this exploratory research study to investigate the
   relationship between achievement goals, reflection behaviors, and
   learning outcomes of engineering students. We used the Achievement Goal
   Questionnaire-Revised (AGQ-R) scale to measure 69 sophomore engineering
   students' achievement goals. Six response variables were included:
   average reflection quality, the total number of reflections submitted,
   two exam scores, the final exam score, and the total weighted learning
   outcomes. Based on our analyses, we found that the mastery approach was
   significantly related to the total number of reflections, the final exam
   score, and the total weighted learning outcome variables. The
   performance approach was also significantly related to the final exam
   and total weighted learning outcome. Mastery avoidance was significantly
   related to the total number of reflections, the second exam, and the
   total weighted learning outcome. Finally, performance avoidance was
   significantly related to the second exam, final exam, and the total
   weighted learning outcome. Overall, our findings are informative to
   researchers in the engineering education field for better understanding
   students' learning strategies, reflection behaviors, and learning
   outcomes relating to their goal orientation. Thus, this study provides
   benefits to researchers and other stakeholders such as faculty members
   or administrators in engineering education to develop more effective
   intervention programs that positively impact student motivation and
   their learning strategies as well as learning outcomes.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To report on the status of residency-based wellness
   initiatives in ophthalmic graduate medical education and identify
   strategies for promoting ophthalmology resident wellness by surveying US
   ophthalmology program directors (PDs).
   DESIGN: The PDs were each sent an e-mail containing a link to an
   anonymous online 15-question survey. The PDs also received a letter with
   the survey link and a \$1 incentive. After 2 weeks, nonresponders
   received 2 weekly reminder e-mails and phone calls. Descriptive
   statistics were used to analyze the multiple choice responses and
   categorize the free response answers.
   SETTING: National survey.
   PARTICIPANTS: All 111 US ophthalmology PDs were invited to participate.
   RESULTS: Of 111 PDs, 56 (50\%) responded; 14 (26\%) of 53 respondents
   reported that their programs faced an issue involving resident
   depression, burnout, or suicide within the last year; 25 (45\%) of 56
   reported that their department had a resident wellness program.
   Respondents without wellness programs reported a shortage of time
   (19/30; 63\%) and lack of training and resources (19/30; 63\%) as
   barriers to instituting these programs. Respondents reported that the
   Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education could better
   promote resident wellness by providing training resources for burnout
   and depression screening (35/53; 66\%), resilience skills building
   (38/53; 72\%), and wellness program development (36/53; 68\%).
   CONCLUSIONS: This survey suggests that there is a substantial burden of
   burnout and depression among residents in ophthalmic graduate medical
   education and that this burden can be addressed by promoting the
   training of educators to recognize the signs of burnout and depression,
   and providing resources to develop and expand formal wellness programs.

Title = {Engagement with peer observation of teaching by a dental school faculty
   in the United Kingdom},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Introduction: Well-conducted peer observation of teaching (POT)
   programmes are effective in enhancing teaching quality and teacher
   development in higher education including healthcare teaching. This
   study evaluated POT's use in dental education and involved predominantly
   clinical dental educators working in a United Kingdom (UK) dental school
   and hospital. It aimed to (i) audit their engagement with POT, (ii)
   review the design(s) of POT in use, (iii) assess participant's perceived
   value of POT and (iv) explore ways that the existing programme could be
   enhanced to maximise its utility.
   Method: Dental educators' teaching role and experience, current
   engagement and experience of POT were explored using an anonymous mixed
   methodology questionnaire survey which was administered during 2016.
   Free-text responses were subjected to thematic analysis to identify
   emerging themes.
   Results: Of 65 surveys distributed, 57 (88\%) completed surveys were
   returned. The majority of respondents reported that POT was a useful
   process which resulted in self-perceived enhanced teaching quality.
   Choice of observer emerged as fundamental to POT's success. Despite
   recognising its utility, only 46\% of the academic teaching faculty
   underwent POT during a 12-month period. Utilisation of a reciprocal,
   ``critical friends{''} approach was infrequent. A number of barriers to
   its regular and effective use emerged.
   Conclusions: POT is an effective method for dental educator development
   through feedback and self-reflection. Strategies to enhance the Dental
   Institute's POT programme are suggested. The quality of the POT process
   rather than its frequency is an important factor to consider. POT may be
   an effective developmental intervention for part-time teachers.},

Title = {The effects of an immersive 3d interactive video program on improving
   student nurses' nursing skill competence: A randomized controlled trial
   study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Background and objective: Acquired accurate clinical nursing skills are
   among the most important core nursing competencies for nursing students,
   as nursing students' inadequate skill capacities might endanger patients
   safety. Therefore, it is essential to develop teaching strategies to
   strengthen students' nursing skills. This study examined the effects of
   an immersive three-dimensional (3D) interactive video program on
   improving nursing students' nasogastric tube feeding skill competence.
   Design: A randomized controlled trial research design.
   Settings and participants: Forty-five nursing students from a university
   in northern Taiwan.
   Methods: The students were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n
   = 22) and a comparison group (n = 23). The intervention group received
   the immersive 3D interactive video program on nasogastric tube feeding,
   whereas the comparison group watched a regular demonstration video. The
   questionnaire was used to collect data before the intervention,
   immediately after the intervention, and one month after the
   intervention. Results: Nursing students' knowledge and confidence in
   nasogastric tube feeding were significantly improved after the
   intervention in both groups. Although there were no significant
   differences in students' knowledge, skill, and confidence between the
   two groups, participants' average satisfaction score with the immersive
   3D interactive video program in the intervention group was significantly
   higher than in the comparison group that watched a regular video (t =
   2.302, p = 0.026).
   Conclusions: The findings of this study showed that both immersive 3D
   interactive video program and regular demonstration video could improve
   nursing students' learning outcomes. The higher satisfaction score in
   the intervention group indicates that learning through immersive 3D
   interactive video is acceptable and satisfactory. This study provides
   useful information for nursing faculty members for designing and
   developing teaching methods for the acquisition of nursing skills. It
   can also serve as a reference for further studies relating to AR, VR, or
   immersive learning materials.},

Title = {Developing Confidence in Uncertainty: Conflicting Roles of Trainees as
   They Become Educators in Veterinary and Human Medicine},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},

Abstract = {The important role of medical trainees (interns and residents) as
   teachers is increasingly recognized in veterinary and human medicine,
   but often is not supported through adult learning programs or other
   preparatory training methods. To develop appropriate teaching programs
   focused on effective clinical teaching, more understanding is needed
   about the support required for the trainee's teaching role. Following
   discussion among faculty members from education and veterinary and
   pediatric medicine, an experienced external observer and expert in
   higher education observed 28 incoming and outgoing veterinary and
   pediatric trainees in multiple clinical teaching settings over 10 weeks.
   Using an interpretative approach to analyze the data, we identified five
   dynamics that could serve as the foundation for a new program to support
   clinical teaching: (1) Novice-Expert, recognizing transitions between
   roles; (2) Collaboration-Individuality, recognizing the power of peer
   learning; (3) Confidence-Uncertainty, regarding the confidence to act;
   (4) Role-Interdisciplinarity, recognizing the ability to maintain a
   discrete role and yet synthesize knowledge and cope with complexity; and
   (5) Socialization-Identity, taking on different selves. Trainees in
   veterinary and human medicine appeared to have similar needs for support
   in teaching and would benefit from a variety of strategies: faculty
   should provide written guidelines and practical teaching tips; set clear
   expectations; establish sustained support strategies, including contact
   with an impartial educator; identify physical spaces in which to discuss
   teaching; provide continuous feedback; and facilitate peer observation
   across medical and veterinary clinical environments.},

Title = {Near-Peer Learning During the Surgical Clerkship: A Way to Facilitate
   Learning After a 15-Month Preclinical Curriculum},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {78},

Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the performance and perspectives of
   third-year medical students (MS3s) participating in near-peer learning
   (NPL) sessions during their core surgical clerkship following a 15-month
   preclerkship curriculum.
   DESIGN: An evaluation study of 7 NPL sessions developed and implemented
   by fourth-year medical students (MS4s) held from March 2019 to February
   2020. MS4s taught 1-2 sessions per rotation that included test taking
   strategies, illness script development, radiology review, case-based
   multiple-choice questions, and rapid review. Participants completed a
   questionnaire with 11 seven point Likert and open-ended questions after
   each session. Analyses included quantitative comparison of shelf score
   averages between NPL participants and nonparticipants and qualitative
   content analysis for open-ended questions.
   SETTING: Surgical clerkship at the University of California, San
   Francisco.
   PARTICIPANTS: Forty-eight (32\%) MS3s participated, with an average
   attendance of 10 students per rotation. Thirtythree (69\%) participants
   completed the questionnaire.
   RESULTS: MS3s enjoyed the session (6.9 +/- 0.4), improved their
   knowledge (6.8 +/- 0.5), and felt more prepared for the surgery shelf
   examination (6.5 +/- 0.6). MS4 leaders found that MS3s always wanted
   radiology review, and their interest in test taking strategies and
   illness script development declined across the clerkship year.
   Participants had lower shelf exam scores compared to nonparticipants
   (68.1 vs 71.4, respectively; p = 0.04,ES = 0.03). Shelf exam scores
   increased over time in both cohorts. Each group had 2 shelf exam
   failures. Qualitative analysis suggests that MS3s appreciated the NPL's
   tailored approach and exam demystification, with a desire for increased
   NPL integration into the clerkship.
   CONCLUSION: Students participating in NPL were satisfied with the
   sessions. Participants may have been students who struggled as indicated
   by shelf exam scores and appreciated the support. The shift in preferred
   topics across the blocks reflects the students' development during
   clerkships. Near-peer teachers should adjust sessions over time to fit
   students' evolving needs. (C) 2020 Association of Program Directors in

Title = {Exploring learning effectiveness for participant roles during healthcare
   simulation},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {119},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Universities face challenges in preparing future nurses for
   the workforce. It is essential to guide educators on strategies to
   achieve similar learning objectives to overcoming these challenges.
   Educators widely use the observer role in simulation, but researchers do
   not study the role thoroughly in current simulation research. There is a
   lack of discipline-specific research exploring how observers learn in
   simulation and if they can engage in the experiential learning intended
   in the simulation activity.Objectives: The objective of this research is
   to determine the difference in simulation effectiveness between the
   process-based role versus the response-based role (observers) in
   participants during simulation-based learning experiences. Design: This
   research used a quasi-experimental posttest only design to determine
   differences in simulation effectiveness among learner roles using the
   Simulation Effectiveness Tool-Modified (SET-M). Setting \& participants:
   The researcher collected data from 193 prelicensure nursing students
   enrolled in any se-mester of one Midwestern undergraduate baccalaureate
   nursing program.Methods: Nursing students completed the assigned
   face-to-face simulations in their current curriculum plan. Each
   participant was randomly assigned to a participant role: direct
   participant role as either a primary or secondary nurse, non-directed
   observer with no briefing or observer guide, direct observer with an
   observation guide, or in -scenario observer assigned to a non-clinical
   or other professional role within the scenario. After debriefing of the
   simulation, participants completed the demographic survey and
   SET-M.Results: There were no significant differences found in
   prelicensure nursing students' simulation effectiveness among the four
   participant roles studied.Conclusion: This study suggests simulation
   effectiveness (learning and confidence) happens regardless of the
   participants role during the simulation activity. Educators should
   consider what roles are necessary within each scenario and assign
   observation roles as needed.},

Abstract = {Background: The labor ward is an important and challenging learning area
   for midwifery students. It is there the students learn in authentic
   complex situations, in intimate situations, with potential risk for the
   life and health of mothers and their babies.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the main concern
   expressed by midwifery students in labor wards and how they handled this
   concern.
   Design: A longitudinal study based on grounded theory methodology was
   used. The participants were 10 postgraduate midwifery students, from a
   University College in Norway. Data were gathered and analyzed throughout
   the 2-year postgraduate program, in the students first, third and fourth
   semesters. Every student was interviewed three times in a total of 15
   single and three focus-group sessions.
   Findings: The grounded theory of ``building relationships{''} explains
   how students dealt with their main concern: ``how to gain access to
   learning experiences{''}. This theory consisted of three strategies; a)
   controlling vulnerability, b) cultivating trust and c) obtaining
   acceptance.
   Conclusion: Clarifying discussions involving midwives and students may
   facilitate the process of building relationships and contribute to
   confident learning. Students appreciate it when the midwives initiate
   discussions about acute situations and state that a novice may perceive
   labor and childbirth as more frightening than an experienced midwife
   would. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Observational Learning During Simulation-Based Training in Arthroscopy:
   Is It Useful to Novices?},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Observing experts constitutes an important and common
   learning experience for surgical residents before operating under direct
   guidance. However, studies suggest that exclusively observing experts
   may induce suboptimal motor learning, and watching errors from
   non-experts performing simple motor tasks may generate better
   performance. We investigated whether observational learning is
   transferrable to arthroscopy learning using virtual reality (VR)
   simulation.
   SETTING/DESIGN: In our surgical simulation laboratory, we compared
   students learning basic skills on a VR arthroscopy simulator after
   watching an expert video demonstration of VR arthroscopy tasks or a
   non-expert video demonstration of the same tasks to a Control group
   without video demonstration. Ninety students in 3 observing groups
   (expert, non-expert, and Control) subsequently completed the same
   procedure on a VR arthroscopy simulator. We hypothesized the
   non-expert-watching group would outperform the expert-watching group,
   and both groups to outperform the Control group. We examined performance
   pretest, posttest, and 1 week later.
   PARTICIPANTS: Participants were recruited from the final year of medical
   school and the very early first year of surgical residency training
   programs (orthopaedic surgery, urology, plastic surgery, and general
   surgery) at Western University (Ontario, Canada).
   RESULTS: All participants improved their overall performance from
   pretest to retention (p < 0.001). At initial retention testing,
   non-expert-watching group outperformed the other groups in camera path
   length p < 0.05 and time to completion, p < 0.05, and both the
   expert/non-expert groups surpassed the Control group in camera path
   length (p < 0.05).
   CONCLUSION: We suggest that error-observation may contribute to skills
   improvement in the non-expert-watching group. Allowing novices to
   observe techniques/errors of other novices may assist internalization of
   specific movements/skills required for effective motor performances.
   This study highlights the potential effect of observational learning on
   surgical skills acquisition and offers preliminary evidence for
   peer-based practice (combined non-experts and experts) as a
   complementary surgical motor skills training strategy. (C) 2018

Abstract = {Capability based planning (CBP) is a strategy focused planning framework
   that facilitates organizations to systematically develop capacity to
   achieve their business objectives in highly uncertain, dynamic and
   competitive environments. Capability programming is an integral part of
   CBP which requires selecting a portfolio of capability projects for
   execution, referred as a capability program, such that the overall
   strategic risk facing the planning organization across a number of
   projected future operating scenarios is minimized while maintaining the
   most economical choice. It is a challenging optimization problem that
   requires handling a number of dynamic constraints and objectives that
   vary throughout the entire planning horizon. An optimizing simulation
   approach is presented in this paper that combines an evolutionary
   multi-objective optimization algorithm with a reinforcement learning
   technique to generate capability programs which optimize strategic risks
   and program costs across multiple planning scenarios as well as over a
   rolling planning horizon. The role of the optimization algorithm in this
   approach is to search for the non-dominated capability programs at each
   decision point by minimizing the strategic risks associated with
   individual capability projects across a number of planning scenarios as
   well as the total cost of the program. The reinforcement learning
   algorithm, on the other hand, searches horizontally within the set of
   non-dominated programs to minimize capability risks and costs over the
   entire planning horizon. The methodology is evaluated on a test problem
   generated based on the data distributions in an Australian Defence
   Capability Plan and the performance is compared with two myopic
   heuristic methods. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Beyond knowledge: Examining digital literacy's role in the acquisition
   of understanding in science},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Today's students must learn to be critical consumers of the digital
   learning technologies that are rapidly populating their world. Digital
   literacy is not an innate skill, and comprises more than facility using
   the Internet, word processing programs, or social media. Likewise,
   literacy itself has been redefined as the acquisition of not just
   knowledge, but also understanding including reasons and evidence for
   knowing. We wished to build upon Greene et al.'s (2014) research on the
   role of digital literacy when acquiring knowledge by conducting a
   similar study with a learning task focused on acquiring understanding.
   Using a similar single-group pretest-posttest correlational design with
   a larger sample of 53 college students but a different learning task
   focused on understanding, we found evidence of significant differences
   in digital literacy processing. In this study, participants engaged in
   more planning, monitoring, and epistemic cognition processing than
   participants in the previous study. Our findings have important
   implications for studying and promoting digital literacy, while also
   illustrating the importance of investing in resource intensive work on
   differences in digital literacy processing across a variety of domains,
   contexts, and educational goals.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine in-service physical
   education teachers' perceptions of and perceived value of
   technology-related learning across three formal training experiences
   (pre-service education, in-service continuing professional development,
   and graduate education). Methods: Twelve teachers enrolled in a
   graduate-level physical education teacher education program at a rural
   mid-Atlantic university participated in the study. Participants
   completed the Stage of Adoption of Technology survey (Christensen, 1997)
   and engaged in individual semi-structured interviews. Results: Six
   learning sources and four themes relative to participants' perceptions
   of and perceived value of technology learning experiences emerged from
   the interview which include (a) absence of technology in K-12 PE, (b)
   technology-centric experience, (c) broadened awareness through
   observation, and (d) growth through hands-on experience. Conclusion: The
   findings align with and extend to previous research that suggests
   technology experiences must be dynamic, authentic, and tailored for
   individuals at different stages of technology adoption.},

Abstract = {Software verification and validation (V \& V) is one of the significant
   areas of software engineering for developing high quality software. It
   is also becoming part of the curriculum of a universities' software and
   computer engineering departments. This paper reports the experience of
   teaching undergraduate software engineering students and discusses the
   main problems encountered during the course, along with suggestions to
   overcome these problems. This study covers all the different topics
   generally covered in the software verification and validation course,
   including static verification and validation. It is found that prior
   knowledge about software quality concepts and good programming skills
   can help students to achieve success in this course. Further, team work
   can be chosen as a strategy, since it facilitates students'
   understanding and motivates them to study. It is observed that students
   were more successful in white box testing than in black box testing.},

Title = {An evaluation of a structured learning program as a component of the
   clinical practicum in undergraduate nurse education: A repeated measures
   analysis},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {36},
Pages = {172-177},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: There is evidence that nursing students experience stress
   and anxiety and,a reduction in self-efficacy when undertaking clinical
   placements. Previous reports have identified that a structured three-day
   program within the Bachelor of Nursing (BN) clinical practicum reduces
   the students self-report of anxiety and increases self-efficacy.
   However, it is unreported whether these improved outcomes are sustained
   for the duration of the clinical placement.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the duration of the
   effect of a three-day structured learning program within the clinical
   placement on final year Bachelor of Nursing student's report of anxiety
   and self-efficacy pre- and post-program participation in this
   intervention and following completion of the clinical practicum.
   Design: A repeated measures design.
   Setting: University-based Clinical School of Nursing, acute care
   clinical practicum.
   Participants: Final year Bachelor of Nursing students.
   Methods: The intervention comprised the three-day program on starting
   the clinical practicum. A questionnaire included the anxiety subscale of
   The Hospital Anxiety \& Depression Scale (The HAD) and the General
   Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES-12). The questionnaire was completed on day
   one (time one), upon completion of the three-day program (time two) and
   upon completion of placement on day 18 (time three).
   Results: The questionnaire response rate varied over time. There was a
   statistically significant effect in reducing anxiety over time:
   F(1.73,74.46) = 25.20, p < 0.001 and increasing self-efficacy over time
   F(132,41.04) = 7.72, p < 0.004.
   Conclusions: This is the first report that we are aware of that has
   measured final year Bachelor of Nursing student's report of both anxiety
   and self-efficacy over repeated measures of time. Students continue to
   benefit from a structured learning program and the benefit of the
   intervention is sustained for the clinical placement duration. (C) 2015

Title = {Does clinical teacher training always improve teaching effectiveness as
   opposed to no teacher training? A randomized controlled study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {Background: Teacher training may improve teaching effectiveness, but it
   might also have paradoxical effects. Research on expertise development
   suggests that the integration of new strategies may result in a
   temporary deterioration of performance until higher levels of competence
   are reached. In this study, the impact of a clinical teacher training on
   teaching effectiveness was assessed in an intensive course in emergency
   medicine. As primary study outcome students' practical skills at the end
   of their course were chosen.
   Methods: The authors matched 18 clinical teachers according to clinical
   experience and teaching experience and then randomly assigned them to a
   two-day-teacher training, or no training. After 14 days, both groups
   taught within a 12-hour intensive course in emergency medicine for
   undergraduate students. The course followed a clearly defined
   curriculum. After the course students were assessed by structured
   clinical examination (SCE) and MCQ. The teaching quality was rated by
   students using a questionnaire.
   Results: Data for 96 students with trained teachers, and 97 students
   with untrained teachers were included. Students taught by untrained
   teachers performed better in the SCE domains `alarm call' (p < 0.01) and
   `ventilation' (p = 0.01), while the domains `chest compressions' and
   `use of automated defibrillator' did not differ. MCQ scores revealed no
   statistical difference. Overall, teaching quality was rated
   significantly better by students of untrained teachers (p = 0.05).
   Conclusions: At the end of a structured intensive course in emergency
   medicine, students of trained clinical teachers performed worse in 2 of
   4 practical SCE domains compared to students of untrained teachers. In
   addition, subjective evaluations of teaching quality were worse in the
   group of trained teachers. Difficulties in integrating new strategies in
   their teaching styles might be a possible explanation.},

Title = {Classification of nervous system withdrawn and approved drugs with
   ToxPrint features via machine learning strategies},
Journal = {COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {142},
Pages = {9-19},

Abstract = {Background and objectives: Early-phase virtual screening of candidate
   drug molecules plays a key role in pharmaceutical industry from data
   mining and machine learning to prevent adverse effects of the drugs.
   Computational classification methods can distinguish approved drugs from
   withdrawn ones. We focused on 6 data sets including maximum 110 approved
   and 110 withdrawn drugs for all and nervous system diseases to
   distinguish approved drugs from withdrawn ones.
   Methods: In this study, we used support vector machines (SVMs) and
   ensemble methods (EMs) such as boosted and bagged trees to classify
   drugs into approved and withdrawn categories. Also, we used CORINA
   Symphony program to identify Toxprint chemotypes including over 700
   predefined chemotypes for determination of risk and safety assesment of
   candidate drug molecules. In addition, we studied nervous system
   withdrawn drugs to determine the key fragments with The ParMol package
   including gSpan algorithm.
   Results: According to our results, the descriptors named as the number
   of total chemotypes and bond CN\_amine\_aliphatic\_generic were more
   significant descriptors. The developed Medium Gaussian SVM model reached
   78\% prediction accuracy on test set for drug data set including all
   disease. Here, bagged tree and linear SVM models showed 89\% of
   accuracies for phycholeptics and psychoanaleptics drugs. A set of
   discriminative fragments in nervous system withdrawn drug (NSWD) data
   sets was obtained. These fragments responsible for the drugs removed
   from market were benzene, toluene, N,N-dimethylethylamine, crotylamine,
   5-methyl-2,4-heptadiene, octatriene and carbonyl group.
   Conclusion: This paper covers the development of computational
   classification methods to distinguish approved drugs from withdrawn
   ones. In addition, the results of this study indicated the
   identification of discriminative fragments is of significance to design
   a new nervous system approved drugs with interpretation of the
   structures of the NSWDs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom approach is aimed at improving learning outcomes
   by promoting learning motivation and engagement. Recommendation systems
   can also be used to improve learning outcomes. With the rapid
   development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, various systems
   have been developed to facilitate student learning. Accordingly, we
   applied AI-enabled personalized video recommendations to stimulate
   students' learning motivation and engagement during a systems
   programming course in a flipped classroom setting. We assigned students
   to control and experimental groups comprising 59 and 43 college
   students, respectively. The students in both groups received flipped
   classroom instruction, but only those in the experimental group received
   AI-enabled personalized video recommendations. We quantitatively
   measured students' engagement based on their learning profiles in a
   learning management system. The results revealed that the AI-enabled
   personalized video recommendations could significantly improve the
   learning performance and engagement of students with a moderate
   motivation level.},

Abstract = {Introduction:Interprofessional education (IPE) interventions lack
   clarity regarding development and implementation, impeding a clear
   understanding of their role and effectiveness. The aim of this study was
   to identify whether and how an outreach program targeting
   interprofessional health care teams can improve self-efficacy and
   interprofessional collaboration (IPC).Methods:A cohort study was
   conducted to explore the effect of the program on individual
   self-efficacy and perceived IPC and investigate factors affecting
   interprofessional learning and collaboration. The program was a two-year
   IPE program consisting of workshops, educational materials, and
   interworkshop support. Participants were physicians, nurses, dietitians,
   pharmacists, and social workers at two primary care teams in Toronto.
   Self-efficacy and team function were measured five times throughout the
   program. We used analysis of variance and t-tests to compare between
   teams and used Pearson correlations to estimate the relationship between
   self-efficacy and team function. One-on-one interviews investigated
   factors affecting IPC and the program's effect on IPC.Results:Team
   function improved as the program progressed (P = .02); although it did
   not affect self-efficacy, there was an increasing correlation between
   self-efficacy and team function as the program progressed (P < .01 for
   workshop 5). Interviews revealed that trust, liability concerns, and
   geographic proximity were mediators of IPC. The workshops were perceived
   to enable trust building by increasing knowledge and allowing
   nonphysician team members to showcase their expertise.Discussion:Our
   findings demonstrate that an IPE workshop, through role clarification,
   cultivation of trust, and a community of practice, can promote these
   elements. Trust in team members and geographic proximity are potential
   facilitators to IPC developed during an interprofessional program.},

Abstract = {Cultural competence in professional and research practice is important
   to effectively deliver animal and One Health services and programs.
   Veterinarians work with culturally and linguistically diverse teams,
   clients, and communities. Cultural perspectives on the significance and
   perceptions of animals and differences in consultation and engagement
   protocols and strategies can influence client-practitioner and
   researcher-community relationships, impacting animal health, welfare,
   and/or research outcomes. Curricula have been proposed to build cultural
   capacity in graduates, but these have not been reported in veterinary
   programs, and early attempts to integrate cultural competency into the
   University of Sydney veterinary curriculum lacked a formal structure and
   were ad hoc with respect to implementation. To address this, the authors
   introduced a broad curriculum framework into the University of Sydney
   veterinary program, which defines cultural competence, perceptions of
   animals, effective communication, and community engagement in a range of
   contexts. Cultural competency learning outcomes were described for units
   of study. These were contextually relevant and aligned to course
   learning outcomes and University of Sydney graduate qualities.
   Constructive alignment was achieved by linking learning outcomes to
   teaching and learning activities and assessment. The continuum of
   cultural competency underpinned mapping of cultural competency across
   the curriculum with staged, vertical integration of key principles.
   Additionally, action to engage staff, students, and stakeholders in a
   cultural competence agenda assisted in sustaining curriculum change. The
   result was integration of cultural competency across the curriculum
   aligning with recommendations from accrediting bodies and with best
   practice models in medicine, nursing, and allied health programs.},

Abstract = {A group of teachers from Northeast Brazil developed a model of membrane
   potentials and action potential and tested the hypothesis that using the
   peer-instruction model would provide a better performance for students
   in reading traditional texts and lectures. The results were obtained
   from 357 students from 20 different courses in 9 different undergraduate
   programs. All students attended two 100-min theoretical lecture and, at
   the end of the second lecture, were asked to answer a multiple-choice
   question (a pretest). In the following lecture, students were divided
   into three groups: control, text, and model. At the end of the lecture,
   everyone responded to a posttest. Student performance in the pretest did
   not differ significantly between groups. In the comparison between the
   pretest and the posttest, students in the model and text groups
   significantly improved their performance, but there was no improvement
   in the control group. In the posttest, the model group presented a
   better performance than the control group. In the evaluation of the
   strategies used, 46\% of the students indicated that the text would be
   very useful to remind them about the subject in the future, whereas 80\%
   of those who used the model indicated that it would be very useful or
   extremely useful. useful. Although it was not possible to support the
   hypothesis conclusively, the performance model group, at least in part,
   was due to the use of active methodologies that constitute a
   differential in the teaching-learning process.},

Abstract = {Following professional development (PD), implementation of contemporary
   topics into high school biology requires teachers to make critical
   decisions regarding integration of novel content into existing course
   scope and sequence. Often exciting topics, such as neuroscience, do not
   perfectly align with standards. Despite commitment to enacting what was
   learned in the PD, teachers must adapt novel content to their
   perceptions of good teaching, local context, prior knowledge of their
   students, and state and district expectations. How teachers decide to
   integrate curricula encountered from PD programs may affect student
   outcomes. This mixed-methods study examined the relationship between
   curricular application strategies following an inquiry-based
   neuroscience PD and student learning. Post-PD curricular implementation
   was measured qualitatively through analysis of teacher action plans and
   classroom observations and quantitatively using hierarchical linear
   modeling to determine the impact of implementation on student
   performance. Participation in neuroscience PD predicted improved student
   learning compared with control teachers. Of the two distinct curricular
   implementation strategies, enacting a full unit produced significantly
   greater student learning than integrating neuroscience activities into
   existing biology units. Insights from this analysis should inform
   teacher implementation of new curricula after PD on other contemporary
   biology topics.},

Abstract = {Modern automotive systems have been equipped with a highly increasing
   number of onboard computer vision hardware and software, which are
   considered to be beneficial for achieving eco-driving. This article
   combines computer vision and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to
   improve the fuel economy of hybrid electric vehicles. The proposed
   method is capable of autonomously learning the optimal control policy
   from visual inputs. The state-of-the-art convolutional neural
   networks-based object detection method is utilized to extract available
   visual information from onboard cameras. The detected visual information
   is used as a state input for a continuous DRL model to output energy
   management strategies. To evaluate the proposed method, we construct 100
   km real city and highway driving cycles, in which visual information is
   incorporated. The results show that the DRL-based system with visual
   information consumes 4.3-8.8\% less fuel compared with the one without
   visual information, and the proposed method achieves 96.5\% fuel economy
   of the global optimum-dynamic programming.},

   Strategy Development Case Study},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Competitions are being widely used to motivate students in diverse
   learning processes, including those in computer programming. This paper
   presents a methodology for designing and assessing competitive learning
   scenarios that allow students to develop three different coding skills:
   the ability to compete against unknown competitors, the ability to
   compete against known competitors and the ability to compete against
   refined versions of known competitors. The proposal is based on peer
   code review, implemented as an improvement cycle after the dissemination
   of the code among participants. A case study evaluating the methodology
   was conducted with two cohorts of students in an undergraduate course.
   The analysis of the obtained grades suggests that while performance
   after our assistance was improved, students could still fail or succeed
   independently of the assistance. Complementary data from student
   questionnaires and supervisor observations are aligned with this
   finding. As a conclusion, the evidence supports the validity of the
   methodology. Additionally, several guidelines based on the experience
   are provided to transfer the proposal to other environments.},

Abstract = {Teaching strategies have been used by several Higher Education
   Institutions to improve learning rates. In this context, international
   surveys have identified Active Learning as a methodology that provides
   students with the ability to be coauthors of their own learning process
   in which they occupy the central role. Professors also play an important
   role of process mediators through this methodology. Thus, strategies
   such as problem-based learning, collaborative learning, peer assessment,
   flipped classroom, among others, have been identified by experts as
   Active Learning approaches that increase learning rates. It so happens
   because it improves autonomy in reading, self-learning, discussions in
   pairs, information sharing, researches and discoveries. Despite the
   foregoing, Active Learning implementation in a higher education course
   is not an easy task, thence this research seeks answers to the following
   question: ``What are the main strengths, limitations and challenges to
   implement Active Learning in a higher education institution?''. In order
   to answer such a question, this paper aims to present a case study on
   the implementation of Active Learning in a higher education program. The
   object of this research is an undergraduate course in Logistics
   Technology of a Brazilian institution, with emphasis on its
   implementation actions, feedback from students and professors and
   experiences obtained from the discipline of Statistical Methods, which
   is considered as pilot project. In order to better understand its
   theory, a literature review of Active Methodology is going to be
   presented in the first and second sections, the third section is going
   to highlight some international experiences, its methods are going to be
   presented in the fourth section, and discussions of the case study and
   research conclusions are going to be shown in the fifth and sixth
   sections, respectively.},

Title = {Leveraging Resident-As-Teacher Training for Health Equity Education: A
   Transformative Approach},
Journal = {TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 11},
Abstract = {Issue: Resident teachers play an essential role in medical education and
   can support broader efforts to advance anti-racism and health equity in
   medicine. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education
   requires programs to provide education about health care disparities so
   residents can contribute to and lead work in this area. However, the
   literature includes few examples, frameworks, or strategies for
   preparing residents to develop the knowledge and skills needed to
   promote health equity, including in their role as clinical teachers.
   Evidence: In this article, the authors propose leveraging
   Resident-as-Teacher training to support residents in learning and
   teaching for health equity. Gorski's conceptualization of equity
   literacy provides an evidence-based framework for four main abilities
   (recognizing, responding, redressing, and cultivating/sustaining)
   residents and medical students can develop through co-learning about
   health equity in the clinical learning environment. The authors discuss
   preconditions, example activities, and assessments strategies for
   effective health equity education. Based on the principles of social
   learning theory, the authors recommend that Resident-as-Teacher training
   be part of an institutional strategy to cultivate a community of
   practice for health equity education. Implications: Incorporating health
   equity education into Resident-as-Teacher curriculum offers a
   potentially transformative part of the broader strategy needed to
   prepare the next generation of physicians to enact anti-racism and
   advance health equity.},

Title = {Team-based learning (TBL) in the medical curriculum: better than PBL?},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {DEC 8},
Abstract = {Background: Internationally, medical schools have long used a variety of
   approaches to develop hybrid Problem based learning (PBL) curricula.
   However, Team-based learning (TBL), has gained recent popularity in
   medical education. TBL maintains the advantages of small group teaching
   and learning, but in contrast to Problem-based learning (PBL), does not
   require large numbers of tutors. In 2016, TBL was introduced to Year 1
   of the Sydney Medical Program (SMP). This study sought to compare
   students' perceptions of using TBL in place of PBL.
   Methods: Year 1 students (n = 169) completed three PBL and three TBL
   sessions during one of the following teaching blocks: Musculoskeletal (n
   = 56), Respiratory (n = 59) or Cardiovascular (n = 54). Student feedback
   following completion of each block of teaching was collected by
   questionnaire, using closed and open ended items. Data were analysed
   using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis.
   Results: In total, 144/ 169 (85\%) of participants completed a
   questionnaire regarding PBL, and 152/ 169 (90\%) completed a similar
   questionnaire regarding TBL. The students found positive aspects of
   their TBL experience to include the smaller group size, the use of
   readiness assurance tests, immediate feedback from senior clinicians,
   and time efficiency. In PBL, students reported that variable expertise
   of tutors; limited direction; and large group size hindered their
   learning.
   Conclusions: Overwhelmingly, students preferred TBL over PBL, as the
   optimal teaching strategy. Students found the structure and format of
   the TBL sessions more conducive to learning, engagement and
   participation than PBL sessions. Although the use of TBL required an
   instructional approach, needing direction from the tutor, it remained
   student-centred, generating a range of positive outcomes. Study results
   provide confidence to change from PBL to TBL within Year 1 and Year 2 of
   the SMP in 2017.},

Abstract = {Metacognition and self-regulation are important skills for successful
   learning and have been discussed and researched extensively in the
   general education literature for several decades. More recently, there
   has been growing interest in understanding how metacognitive and
   self-regulatory skills contribute to student success in the context of
   computing education. This article presents a thorough systematic review
   of metacognition and self-regulation work in the context of computer
   programming and an in-depth discussion of the theories that have been
   leveraged in some way. We also discuss several prominent metacognitive
   and self-regulation theories from the literature outside of computing
   education-for example, from psychology and educationthat have yet to be
   applied in the context of programming education.
   In our investigation, we built a comprehensive corpus of papers on
   metacognition and self-regulation in programming education, and then
   employed backward snowballing to provide a deeper examination of
   foundational theories from outside computing education, some of which
   have been explored in programming education, and others that have yet to
   be but hold much promise. In addition, we make newobservations about the
   way these theories are used by the computing education community, and
   present recommendations on how metacognition and self-regulation can
   help inform programming education in the future. In particular, we
   discuss exemplars of studies that have used existing theories to support
   their design and discussion of results as well as studies that have
   proposed their own metacognitive theories in the context of programming
   education. Readers will also find the article a useful resource for
   helping students in programming courses develop effective strategies for
   metacognition and self-regulation.},

Abstract = {This article proposes an adaptive, optimal, data-driven control approach
   based on reinforcement learning and adaptive dynamic programming to the
   three-phase grid-connected inverter employed in virtual synchronous
   generators (VSGs). This article takes into account unknown system
   dynamics and different grid conditions, including balanced/unbalanced
   grids, voltage drop/sag, and weak grids. The proposed method is based on
   value iteration, which does not rely on an initial admissible control
   policy for learning. Considering the premise that the VSG control should
   stabilize the closed-loop dynamics, the VSG outputs are optimally
   regulated through the adaptive, optimal control strategy proposed in
   this article. Comparative simulations and experimental results validate
   the proposed method's effectiveness and reveal its practicality and
   implementation.},

Title = {A randomised controlled trial of feedback to improve patient
   satisfaction and consultation skills in medical students},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Background: The use of feedback has been integral to medical student
   learning, but rigorous evidence to evaluate its education effect is
   limited, especially in the role of patient feedback in clinical teaching
   and practice improvement. The aim of the Patient Teaching Associate
   (PTA) Feedback Study was to evaluate whether additional written consumer
   feedback on patient satisfaction improved consultation skills among
   medical students and whether multisource feedback (MSF) improved student
   performance.
   Methods: In this single site, double-blinded randomised controlled
   trial, 71 eligible medical students from two universities in their first
   clinical year were allocated to intervention or control and followed up
   for one semester. They participated in five simulated student-led
   consultations in a teaching clinic with patient volunteers living with
   chronic illness. Students in the intervention group received additional
   written feedback on patient satisfaction combined with guided
   self-reflection. The control group received usual immediate formative
   multisource feedback from tutors, patients and peers. Student
   characteristics, baseline patient-rated satisfaction scores and
   tutor-rated consultation skills were measured.
   Results: Follow-up assessments were complete in 70 students attending
   the MSF program. At the final consultation episodes, both groups
   improved patient-rated rapport (P = 0.002), tutor-rated
   patient-centeredness and tutor-rated overall consultation skills (P =
   0.01). The intervention group showed significantly better tutor-rated
   patient-centeredness (P = 0.003) comparing with the control group.

   tutor-rated clinical skills did not differ significantly between the two
   groups.
   Conclusions: The innovative multisource feedback program effectively
   improved consultation skills in medical students. Structured written
   consumer feedback combined with guided student reflection further
   improved patient-centred practice and effectively enhanced the benefit
   of an MSF model. This strategy might provide a valuable adjunct to
   communication skills education for medical students.},

   Program: A Descriptive Qualitative Study},

Abstract = {Background: Faculty continue to observe students struggling as they
   adapt their study strategies to learn nursing core content.
   Objectives: This study described the study habits of Bachelor of Science
   in Nursing (BSN) students prior to admission to the program.
   Design: This study used a descriptive qualitative research design.
   Settings and Participants: A purposive sample of 19 BSN students
   (juniors En = 10] and seniors En = 9]) from a 4 year public Midwestern
   university were included in this study.
   Methods: Two focus group sessions, using a semi-structured interview
   guide, were conducted in the spring semester of 2013.
   Results: The four themes which emerged from the analysis of data were:
   ``I just got it,{''} ``I had a lot of time then,{''} ``I studied
   alone{''} mostly, and ``...a little struggle with the sciences.{''}
   Conclusions: The findings suggest the BSN students did not study much or
   employed poor study strategies during their years completing general
   education courses. Academic support is needed by students prior to
   admission to the nursing program so they can learn effective study
   skills and modify their study habits for easier adaptation to the rigors
   of nursing education.},

Abstract = {With an escalating arms race to adopt machine learning (ML) in diverse
   application domains, there is an urgent need to support declarative
   machine learning over distributed data platforms. Toward this goal, a
   new framework is needed where users can specify ML tasks in a manner
   where programming is decoupled from the underlying algorithmic and
   system concerns. In this paper, we argue that declarative abstractions
   based on Datalog are natural fits for machine learning and propose a
   purely declarative ML framework with a Datalog query interface. We show
   that using aggregates in recursive Datalog programs entails a concise
   expression of ML applications, while providing a strictly declarative
   formal semantics. This is achieved by introducing simple conditions
   under which the semantics of recursive programs is guaranteed to be
   equivalent to that of aggregate-stratified ones. We further provide
   specialized compilation and planning techniques for semi-naive fixpoint
   computation in the presence of aggregates and optimization strategies
   that are effective on diverse recursive programs and distributed data
   platforms. To test and demonstrate these research advances, we have
   developed a powerful and user-friendly system on top of Apache Spark.
   Extensive evaluations on large-scale datasets illustrate that this
   approach will achieve promising performance gains while improving both
   programming flexibility and ease of development and deployment for ML
   applications.},

Abstract = {Malware is `malicious software' programs that carry out many of the
   cyberattacks on the Internet, including cybercrime, fraud, scams and
   nation-state cyberwar. These malicious software programs come in a wide
   range of different classifications such as viruses, Trojans, worms,
   spyware, botnet malware, ransomware, Rootkit, etc. Ransomware is class
   of malware that holds the victim's data hostage by encrypting the data
   on a user's computer to make it unavailable to the user and only decrypt
   it after the user pays a ransom in the form of a sum of money. To avoid
   detection, different variants of ransomware utilise one or more
   techniques in their attack flow including Machine Learning (ML)
   algorithms. There is, therefore, a need to understand the techniques
   used ransomware development and their deployment strategy in order to
   understand their attack flow better to develop appropriate
   countermeasures. In this paper, we propose DNAact-Ran, A Digital DNA
   Sequencing Engine for Ransomware Detection Using Machine Learning.
   DNAact-Ran utilises Digital DNA sequencing design constraints and k-mer
   frequency vector. To measure the efficacy of the proposed approach, we
   evaluated DNAact-Run on 582 ransomware and 942 goodware instances to
   measure the performance of precision, recall, f-measure and accuracy.
   Compared to other methods, the evaluation results show that DNAact-Run
   can predict and detect ransomware accurately and effectively.},

Pages = {467-471},
Abstract = {Introduction: The Medical School of the Federal University of Rio Grande
   do Norte (UFRN) is one of the biggest public medical schools in
   Northeast Brazil. In the last decade, significant investment in faculty
   development, innovative learning methodologies and student engagement
   has been key milestones in educational improvement at this medical
   school, harnessed to recent political changes that strengthened
   community-based and emergency education. This study describes how
   curriculum changes in UFRN Medical School have been responsible for
   major improvements in medical education locally and which impacts such
   transformations may have on the educational community.
   Methods: A group of students and teachers revised the new curriculum and
   established the key changes over the past years that have been
   responsible for the local enhancement of medical education. This
   information was compared and contrasted to further educational evidences
   in order to define patterns that can be reproduced in other
   institutions.
   Results: Improvements in faculty development have been fairly observed
   in the institution, exemplified by the participation of a growing number
   of faculty members in programs for professional development and also by
   the creation of a local masters degree in health education. Alongside,
   strong student engagement in curriculum matters enhanced the
   teaching-learning process.
   Conclusions: Due to a deeper involvement of students and teachers in
   medical education, it has been possible to implement innovative
   teaching-learning and assessment strategies over the last ten years and
   place UFRN Medical School at a privileged position in relation to
   undergraduate training, educational research and professional
   development of faculty staff.},

Title = {Homogeneous Group Formation in Collaborative Learning Scenarios: An

Abstract = {The incorporation of collaborative work in the educational field grows
   day after day, as does the research associated with this topic. One of
   the most recurring problems faced by teachers who want to employ this
   learning strategy is the good students' group formation since this task
   can be complex both conceptually and computationally, especially if the
   aim is to automate it. Considering that group formation is key when
   developing activities in collaborative learning scenarios, this article
   aims to propose a technique based on a genetic algorithm approach for
   achieving homogeneous groups, considering the students personality
   traits as grouping criteria, since, the aforementioned traits, have
   proven to be significantly predictive of academic performance and, in
   addition, to be associated with variables with a strong influence on
   academic success, such as intelligence and beliefs of self-efficacy. A
   controlled experiment was designed with 132 students, quantifying the
   personality traits through the ``Big Five Inventory,{''} forming working
   groups and developing a collaborative activity in the initial
   programming courses. The experiment results allowed validation, not only
   from a computational point of view evaluating the algorithm performance
   but also from a pedagogical point of view, confronting the results
   obtained by students: formation based on personality traits versus
   formation by the students' preference. The highlight of this article is
   that the homogeneous groups generated by the proposed approach produced
   better academic results compared to those obtained by groups generated
   by the students' preference, at the moment of developing a collaborative
   activity.},

Abstract = {This paper studies a system of a virtual welding torch employed during
   the teaching process of welding tasks for offline programming of robotic
   manipulators. The torch is manipulated by the user in a virtual
   environment applying a haptic interface. An approach based on a
   spring-damper model is proposed to compute the force to be felt by the
   user during the manipulation of the interface. The force is such that
   more realistic sensations are perceived by the hand's user if a
   collision occurs of the torch in the virtual environment. A suitable
   strategy is employed to represent the virtual torch by two coupled
   models with spring-damper systems (SDS). Such models are termed
   kinematic virtual torch (KVT) and dynamic virtual torch (DVT). Thus, in
   the studied system, the DVT follows the geometric coordinates of the KVT
   during a manipulation of the torch avoiding penetration of other objects
   in the scene. Careful analyses are accomplished on manipulation tasks
   using different SDS configurations in a case study in order to show the
   efficacy of the proposed approach. As a result, a desired welding task
   is properly programmed for a robot in an easy and accurate way.},

Abstract = {The pandemic has influenced most of us either directly or indirectly. In
   ensuring the education is always in line with the National Education
   Philosophy in developing holistic, entrepreneurial, and balanced
   graduates, the Civil Engineering Program of Universiti Malaysia Sabah
   utilizes the UMS-OBE system, particularly in course outcome (CO) input
   to the program outcomes (PO) in the assessment and reporting of
   student's performance. As the main stakeholders, learners and lecturers
   must be actively engaged in the rationale and motivation of implementing
   the OBE mechanisms. Hence this paper evaluated the course learning
   outcome and measured their perceptions by categorizing the ranked
   perception feedback on project-based learning (PBL). This paper
   highlights the modification in implementing PBL that previously involved
   physical work on-site. Due to the movement control order (MCO) enforced
   due to the covid-19 pandemic, the course assessment targeted to instill
   the program outcome (PO) of Environment and Sustainability attribute was
   strategized into 3 phases. The analysis found that the course outcome
   has been successfully achieved, even though a slight decrease was
   observed from the previous regular face-to-face mode. A slight decrease
   was observed in the overall grade achievement and course outcome
   analysis. The instructional modification and intervention in
   Project-Based-learning to improve online learning strategies, despite
   the requirement for engineering community fieldwork through the
   learner's feedback responses during the three phases in model strategies
   for course outcome pedagogy, have shown optimistic input by learners and
   has continuously engaged them through the Project-based-Learning
   completion.},

Abstract = {Motivation and learning are inter-related. It is well known that
   motivating learners is clearly a complex endeavor, which can be
   influenced by the educational program and the learning environment.
   Limited research has been conducted to examine students' motivation as a
   method to assess the effectiveness of dissection in medical education.
   This study aimed to assess and analyze students' motivation following
   their dissection experience. A 29-item survey was developed based on the
   Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction model of motivation.
   Descriptive statistics were undertaken to describe students' motivation
   to the dissection experience. T-test and ANOVA were used to compare
   differences in motivational scores between gender and educational
   characteristics of students. Dissection activities appear to promote
   students' motivation. Gender difference was statistically significant as
   males were more motivated by the dissection experience than females.
   Comparison between students with different knowledge of anatomy was also
   significantly different. The study is an important step in the
   motivational design to improve students' motivation to learn. The
   outcome of this study provides guidance to the selection of specific
   strategies to increase motivation by generating motivational
   strategies/tactics to facilitate learning. Anat Sci Educ 10: 363-371.

Abstract = {This paper seeks to combine differential game theory with the
   actor-critic-identifier architecture to determine forward-in-time,
   approximate optimal controllers for formation tracking in multiagent
   systems, where the agents have uncertain heterogeneous nonlinear
   dynamics. A continuous control strategy is proposed, using communication
   feedback from extended neighbors on a communication topology that has a
   spanning tree. A model-based reinforcement learning technique is
   developed to cooperatively control a group of agents to track a
   trajectory in a desired formation. Simulation results are presented to
   demonstrate the performance of the developed technique.},

Abstract = {An evolutionary process that is currently taking place in the software
   industry is the shift from developing applications from scratch to
   discovering and assembling services published in the Internet. This has
   given birth to a new computing paradigm called service-oriented
   computing (SOC). We investigated whether simplifying and automating
   tasks inherent to SOC-based development, while exploiting systems
   engineering students' experience in earlier paradigms, namely object
   orientation, reduce the cognitive effort needed to learn SOC. The study
   involved 38 undergraduate students plus 7 postgraduate students from 4
   universities, which attended a course about SOC development models and
   technologies. Then, they were asked to develop a real-life
   service-oriented application using two alternatives, namely existing SOC
   libraries and a software support of our own named EasySOC. EasySOC
   promotes using common object-oriented design patterns to structure
   service-oriented applications, facilitates service discovery, and hides
   many technological details from users. The students were surveyed about
   their perception on both alternatives using a Likert-based
   questionnaire. Results show that the students, who had no previous
   experience in service-oriented notions before the experiment, perceived
   that EasySOC allows focusing on essential aspects of the paradigm while
   concealing accidental aspects, and provides adequate support and
   guidance to bridge the gap. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Comput Appl

Abstract = {BACKGROUND School-based COVID-19 testing is a potential strategy to
   limit COVID-19 transmission among youth in congregate settings such as
   schools, sports programs, and summer camps. The purpose of this study is
   to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of frequent rapid antigen
   testing at a supervised distance-learning setting for elementary and
   middle school children while their schools were closed. METHODS This
   evaluation examines participation rates and testing data in addition to
   qualitative analysis of focus groups from a Los Angeles City-sponsored
   rapid antigen testing pilot program. In total, 434 children and staff
   were enrolled in the 13-week pilot program in the spring of 2021.
   RESULTS In this pilot program, 2482 rapid antigen tests were
   administered, resulting in 3 positive test results, 1 of which was a
   false positive (confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing) and 0
   outbreaks or community spread. CONCLUSIONS Throughout this pilot
   program, implementing rapid antigen tests allowed for the quick
   identification and isolation of potentially COVID-19-positive children,
   improved perceived safety for parents and staff who interact with
   children, and demonstrated the ability for staff and non-health care
   professionals in a school-based setting to implement a widespread
   COVID-19 screening program with minimal training.},

Title = {Data Poisoning Attacks on Federated Machine Learning},

Abstract = {Federated machine learning which enables resource-constrained node
   devices (e.g., Internet of Things (IoT) devices and smartphones) to
   establish a knowledge-shared model while keeping the raw data local,
   could provide privacy preservation, and economic benefit by designing an
   effective communication protocol. However, this communication protocol
   can be adopted by attackers to launch data poisoning attacks for
   different nodes, which has been shown as a big threat to most machine
   learning models. Therefore, we in this article intend to study the model
   vulnerability of federated machine learning, and even on IoT systems. To
   be specific, we here attempt to attacking a popular federated multitask
   learning framework, which uses a general multitask learning framework to
   handle statistical challenges in the federated learning setting. The
   problem of calculating optimal poisoning attacks on federated multitask
   learning is formulated as a bilevel program, which is adaptive to the
   arbitrary selection of target nodes and source attacking nodes. We then
   propose a novel systems-aware optimization method, called as attack on
   federated learning (AT(2)FL), to efficiently derive the implicit
   gradients for poisoned data, and further attain optimal attack
   strategies in the federated machine learning. This is an earlier work,
   to our knowledge, that explores attacking federated machine learning via
   data poisoning. Finally, experiments on several real-world data sets
   demonstrate that when the attackers directly poison the target nodes or
   indirectly poison the related nodes via using the communication
   protocol, the federated multitask learning model is sensitive to both
   poisoning attacks.},

Title = {Two-phase ESO and comprehensive learning PSO method for structural
   optimization with discrete steel sections},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {167},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper proposes the novel two-phase metaheuristic method that
   combines the distinctive features provided by evolutionary structural
   optimization (ESO) and comprehensive learning particle swarm
   optimization (CLPSO) for the design of steel structures with standard
   sections. The approach overcomes the challenges associated with local
   optima pitfalls in processing the mixed integer nonlinear programming
   problem, and hence determines the accurate solutions at modest computing
   efforts. In essence, the first-phase ESO design incorporates the
   constraint relaxations to fast eliminate the ineffective (infeasible)
   sections from initial discrete variable domains. This advantageously
   provides a significant reduction in the search spaces performed in the
   second-phase CLPSO scheme. The comprehensive learning technique enhances
   a standard particle swarm optimization algorithm by enabling the
   cooperative responses among swarm populations. The learning probability
   function defines the comprehensive cross-positions between the sets of
   best particles constructed from the reducing sets of steel sections
   specified in the preliminary ESO phase leading to the computation of
   optimal solutions. Various benchmarks (subjected to infinite design
   combinations) illustrate robustness and accuracy of the proposed design
   method (viz., generating the smaller number of particles) as compared to
   conventional metaheuristic algorithms.},

Title = {Optimization of facility location and size problem based on bi-level
   multi-objective programming},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& OPERATIONS RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {145},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {With the rapid urbanization, solving the facility location and size
   problem (FLSP) of general service infrastructure (GSI) has become an
   essential issue in spatial planning. Due to unreasonable location and
   regional scale, the satisfaction of residents has been seriously
   affected. This paper develops a bi-level multi-objective programming
   (BLMOP) to optimize both facility location and size. Three major
   problems have been addressed: (1) solving the contradiction between
   supply and demand; (2) keeping a balance of social, economic, and
   environmental benefits; and (3) designing a multi-objective particle
   swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm by modifying the parameters and
   learning strategies. To obtain feasible solutions, a combination of
   optimistic and pessimistic approaches is adopted. Taking the rural areas
   of Southwest China as an example, the results find that the proposed
   model enables to provide objective-oriented optimization schemes
   depending on the decision-maker's (DM) preferences. Furthermore, the
   MOPSO algorithm can solve the BLMOP and provide Pareto-optimal solutions
   separately.},

Abstract = {Buying and selling stocks are the main activities of investment in the
   financial markets. During several years, financial experts have designed
   various indices and indicators to develop intelligent methods to decide
   whether buy or sell or no trade a specific stock. In this paper, the
   league championship algorithm (LCA) is adapted and equipped with a
   network structure (which provides the implicit memory function, compact
   structure and gives the ability of reusing nodes) for stock trading rule
   extraction process. The proposed algorithm is able to extract and save
   various stock trading rules for various kinds of stock market
   conditions. Each individual in LCA makes role as a sport team which
   could learn from weaknesses and strengths of others to enhance its
   performance. The network structure used for each individual is equipped
   with reinforcement learning to strength the searching power and
   extracting better rules. The backward Q-learning (BQL), which is a
   combination of Sarsa learning and Q-learning algorithms, is also
   hybridized with LCA to increase the learning speed to extract better
   rules. A trend clustering technique is also developed to determine
   uptrends and downtrends and to remedy delay in the trend direction
   reflection along with moving average of stock prices. Finally, to use
   the trading rules extracted and saved in the rule pools, a new approach
   through average matching degree is introduced which could create trinary
   signals of buying, selling, and no trade. The effectiveness of the
   proposed approach is tested on a set of 20 companies, which have high
   liquidity and large market capitalization, chosen from various fields of
   Tehran Stock Exchange. The used historical price data was adjusted
   through factors of dividends and capital increase. Computational tests
   and simulations indicate that our hybrid method clearly offers higher
   profits and lower losses than those of genetic network programming
   method with rule accumulation (GNP-RA) on all stocks and those of the
   Buy\&Hold strategy on 17 out of 20 instances (85\%), especially when the
   price uptrends are sharp. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS FOR SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO

Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 AUG 23},
Abstract = {With the rapid growth of deep learning models and deep learning-based
   applications, how to accelerate the inference of deep neural networks,
   especially neural network operators, has become an increasingly
   important research area. As a bridge between a front-end deep learning
   framework and a back-end hardware platform, deep learning compilers aim
   to optimize various deep learning models for a range of hardware
   platforms with model- and hardware-specific optimizations. Apache TVM
   (or TVM for short), a well-known open-source deep learning compiler,
   uses a customized domain-specific language, called Tensor Expression
   Language, to define hardware-specific optimizations for neural network
   operators. TVM also allows users to write tensor expressions to design
   customized optimizations for specific operators. However, TVM does not
   assist users with supporting information, such as what computations are
   performed within an operator, and tools for optimizing the operators in
   a deep learning model. In addition, tensor expressions have an entirely
   different syntax from imperative languages and are not easy to get
   started with. Furthermore, although TVM comes with an auto-tuning
   module, called AutoTVM, which facilitates the tuning of optimization
   configurations (e.g., tiling size and loop order), AutoTVM takes quite a
   long time to search the optimum configurations for a set of
   optimizations. In this paper, we present DLOOPT, an optimization
   assistant that assists optimization developers in designing effective
   optimizations for neural network operators and/or obtaining optimum
   optimization configurations in a timely manner. DLOOPT specifically
   addresses three key aspects: (1) developers can focus only on designing
   optimizations by using DLOOPT, which offers sufficient information about
   the operators of a given model and provides an easier way to write
   optimizations, (2) the number of optimizations that developers need to
   design can be minimized by using DLOOPT, which allows optimizations to
   be reused, and (3) the tuning process can be greatly simplified by using
   DLOOPT, which implements a set of tuning strategies in AutoTVM. The
   evaluation results showed that DLOOPT reduced more than 99\% of time in
   terms of developing adequate optimizations for operators in a model. We
   believe that DLOOPT is friendly to optimization developers and allows
   them to quickly develop effective optimizations for neural network
   operators.},

   committed suburban middle school Physical Education teachers. Constant
   comparison was used to generate themes and trustworthiness procedures
   were used to confirm findings. Two types of strategies for including OWS
   in instruction were identified: First-order and Second-order. School
   resources, shared program goals, and beliefs about students and teaching
   were factors influencing teachers' decisions and actions for teaching
   motor skill/game play and fitness content to OWS.},

Abstract = {This paper presents on four chosen benchmarks an experimental evidence
   of efficiency of active-set-based algorithms and a gradient projection
   scheme exploiting Barzilai-Borwein-based steplength rule for
   box-constrained quadratic programming problems, which have theoretically
   proven rate of convergence. The crucial phase of active-set-based
   algorithms is the identification of the appropriate active set combining
   three types of steps-a classical minimization step, a step expanding the
   active set and a step reducing it. Presented algorithms employ various
   strategies using the components of the gradient for an update of this
   active set to be fast, reliable and avoiding undesirable oscillations of
   active set size.},

Abstract = {In recent years, resilience has been lauded as a valuable, even
   necessary, facet of an effective veterinary practitioner. This study
   describes a mixed-methods research exploration of the impact of a
   self-care and mental well-being teaching intervention on the
   self-reported resilience of 105 first-year veterinary students enrolled
   at the School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Surrey, UK.
   Quantitative data were obtained through a questionnaire, the 10-item
   Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 10), which students completed
   before and after the teaching intervention. The median total score on
   the scale increased from 27 (IQR = 25-30) to 29 (IQR = 26-32) (p<.001),
   a medium effect size (r = -0.28). Student focus groups were held to
   allow qualitative data analysis of the students' perspectives on the
   teaching intervention and on the topic of resilience in general. The
   results of this study suggest that appropriate training in
   resilience-building strategies can help veterinary students build
   greater awareness of resilience, and potentially support their
   development of a more resilient approach in their personal and
   professional lives. In this study, veterinary students felt that
   resilience training was a valuable addition to the veterinary
   curriculum, and that resilience likely plays an important role in
   achieving a successful veterinary career. The study also suggested that
   veterinary students utilize a variety of different resilience-building
   strategies, including drawing on past experiences, seeking help from
   support networks, and developing an ability to change their
   perspectives.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education
   (ACGME) and The American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery proposed The
   Orthopaedic Surgery Milestone Project. Training residency and fellowship
   programs have evolved accordingly adjusting academic curriculums. A new
   comprehensive Learner-Centered Education Curriculum (LCEC) was designed
   based on critical reviews and interactive collaboration between faculty,
   residents, and fellows using structured interviews and iterative
   feedback. We aim to evaluate the results at 4 years after implementation
   of a new curriculum.
   DESIGN: The new adult arthroplasty LCEC was implemented in 2015; data
   collected between 2015 and 2019 was retrospectively reviewed and
   analyzed. Our primary goal was to evaluate educational, research, and
   quality successes using objective and quantitative academic quality
   metrics including annual Orthopedic In-Training Examination scores for
   the Hip \& Knee domain to evaluate the medical knowledge competency.
   SETTING: This study was conducted at the Department of Orthopedic
   Surgery residency and fellowship program of Adult Arthroplasty and Joint
   Reconstruction Surgery, University of Florida (tertiary care center).
   PARTICIPANTS: Participants include 25 learners (PGY-1 to 5, Clinical
   fellows) and faculty of an ACGME-accredited orthopedic surgery residency
   and adult arthroplasty fellowship program.
   RESULTS: Significant improvements in academic, research and quality
   metrics were obtained since implementation of the LCEC: Orthopedic
   In-Training Examination scores for Hip \& Knee domain increased from
   50th to 87th percentile (P=0.042), annual learner peer-reviewed
   publications and research awards from none before intervention to 20 and
   8 respectively (p < 0.05). Resident and fellows conference attendance
   improved from 81\% to 99\% (p = 0.0001). The ACGME resident
   Likert-evaluations also improved from 4.6 to 4.8.
   CONCLUSION: This LCEC, by enhancing an interactive and active academic
   learning experience, positively influenced fund of knowledge, conceptual
   thinking, and interest in the specialty and learner attitudes.
   Significant and consistent improvements in academic, research, and
   quality metrics were obtained, while maintaining the highest resident
   evaluation scores in the program. (C) 2020 Association of Program

Abstract = {Making rational decisions for sequential decision problems in complex
   environments has been challenging researchers in various fields for
   decades. Such problems consist of state transition dynamics, stochastic
   uncertainties, long-term utilities, and other factors that assemble high
   barriers including the curse of dimensionality. Recently, the
   state-of-the-art algorithms in reinforcement learning studies have been
   developed, providing a strong potential to efficiently break the
   barriers and make it possible to deal with complex and practical
   decision problems with decent performance. We propose a formulation of a
   velocity varying one-on-one quadrotor robot game problem in the
   three-dimensional space and an approximate dynamic programming approach
   using a projected policy iteration method for learning the utilities of
   game states and improving motion policies. In addition, a
   simulation-based iterative scheme is employed to overcome the curse of
   dimensionality. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
   decision strategy can generate effective and efficient motion policies
   that can contend with the opponent quadrotor and gather advantaged
   status during the game. Flight experiments, which are conducted in the
   Networked Autonomous Vehicles (NAV) Lab at the Concordia University,
   have further validated the performance of the proposed decision strategy
   in the real-time environment.},

Title = {A Reinforcement Learning Model Based on Temporal Difference Algorithm},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Abstract = {In some sense, computer game can be used as a test bed of artificial
   intelligence to develop intelligent algorithms. The paper proposed a
   kind of intelligent method: a reinforcement learning model based on
   temporal difference (TD) algorithm. And then the method is used to
   improve the playing power of the computer game of a special kind of
   chess. JIU chess, also called Tibetan Go chess, is mainly played in
   places where Tibetan tribes gather. Its play process is divided two
   sequential stages: preparation and battle. The layout at preparation is
   vital for the successive battle, even for the final winning. Studies on
   Tibetan JIU chess have focused on Bayesian network based pattern
   extraction and chess shape based strategy, which do not perform well. To
   address the low chess power of JIU chess from the view of artificial
   intelligence, we developed a reinforcement learning model based on
   temporal difference (TD) algorithm for the preparation stage of JIU.
   First, the search range was limited within a 6 x 6 area at the center of
   the chessboard, and the TD learning architecture was combined with chess
   shapes to construct an intelligent environmental feedback system.
   Second, optimal state transition strategies were obtained by self-play.
   In addition, the results of the reinforcement learning model were output
   as SGF files, which act as a pattern library for the battle stage. The
   experimental results demonstrate that this reinforcement learning model
   can effectively improve the playing strength of JIU program and
   outperform the other methods.},

Abstract = {PERSPECTIVES: In times of public health crises, medical residency
   program leaders are responsible to maintain the wellbeing of their
   residents and ensure uninterrupted training. COVID-19 caused significant
   impact on healthcare industry, depleting resources and manpower, which
   led to disruption to graduate medical education and residency training.
   Surgical residents were affected by the pandemic both by reduced
   operative opportunities in most training centers and inducing stress and
   concerns about safety and wellbeing among residents. Spread of the
   SARS-Cov-2 was naturally accompanied with a gradual decrease in numbers
   of healthcare personnel which consequently increased the burden on
   residents. During these times of crisis and uncertainty, it is crucial
   that residency programs find alternative learning opportunities and
   deploy pre-designed, dynamic operational strategies to ensure high
   quality surgical services while optimizing resident safety and
   wellbeing. The COVID-19 crisis was a natural call for the essential need
   to add another dimension to residency competencies, which is
   Crisis-based learning and practice. Times of public health crisis are
   opportunities to reflect on the medical practice from an
   interdisciplinary and interprofessional perspective and train the
   residents to function as part of a larger, globally responsible team. It
   also calls upon adopting innovative instructional and learning
   strategies such as utilizing digital and online learning tools to
   complement learning. A holistic approach to the crisis was taken by the
   surgical residency program at the University of Illinois in Chicago,
   which addressed the issue from a resident, hospital, and public health
   standpoints. An operational strategy was introduced to optimize resident
   safety, maximize learning opportunities, support other non-surgical
   services, and promote online teaching and learning. This strategy is
   meant to serve as a dynamic reference for surgical residency programs
   and as an infrastructure for dealing with this and any upcoming
   healthcare crises in an efficient and resident-centered way. ((C) 2020

Abstract = {Elementary school children spend less and less time outdoors in nature.
   In this way they will neither become familiar with plants and animals in
   their environment, nor will their environmental awareness develop. The
   solution for them would be to spend more quality time outdoors. In this
   work 170 teachers from Hungary and 170 teachers from Serbia shared their
   experiences and opinions about outdoor education. The aim was to
   determine whether they thought that outdoor classes were an effective
   method to bring pupils closer to nature. The research showed that
   teachers from both countries found teaching in a real environment vital
   but could not always implement it. They need help in the form of ideas,
   teaching programs and professional development courses to be confident
   and motivated to hold more outdoor classes.},

Abstract = {Cancer has become the leading cause of death in North Carolina (NC)
   (North Carolina DHHS, State Center for Health Statistics 2015) and the
   eastern region of North Carolina (ENC) has experienced greater cancer
   mortality than the remainder of the state. The Pitt County Breast
   Wellness Initiative-Education (PCBWI-E) provides culturally tailored
   breast cancer education and navigation to screening services for
   uninsured/underinsured women in Pitt and Edgecombe Counties in ENC.
   PCBWI-E created a network of 23 lay breast health educators, and has
   educated 735 women on breast health and breast cancer screening
   guidelines. Navigation services have been provided to 365 women, of
   which 299 were given breast health assessments, 193 were recommended for
   a mammogram, and 138 were screened. We have identified five lessons
   learned to share in the successful implementation of a community-based
   breast cancer screening intervention: (1) community partnerships are
   critical for successful community-based cancer screening interventions;
   (2) assuring access to free or low-cost screening and appropriate
   follow-up should precede interventions to promote increased use of
   breast cancer screening; (3) the reduction of system-based barriers is
   effective in increasing cancer screening; (4) culturally tailored
   interventions can overcome barriers to screening for diverse
   racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups; and (5) multi-component
   interventions that include multiple community health strategies are
   effective in increasing screening.},

Title = {Who owns responsibility? An administrator's take on implementing
   time-variable medical training in teaching hospitals},

Abstract = {Introduction: Developments in outcome-based medical education led to the
   introduction of time-variable medical training (TVMT). Although this
   idea of training may be a consequence of competency-based training that
   calls for individualized learning, its implementation has posed
   significant challenges. As a new paradigm it is likely to have
   repercussions on the organization of teaching hospitals. The purpose of
   this study is therefore to explore how hospital administrators cope with
   this implementation process. Methods: We conducted an exploratory
   qualitative study for which we interviewed administrators of hospitals
   who were actively implementing TVMT in their postgraduate programs.
   Results: Several problems of implementation were identified: existing
   governance structures proved unfit to cope with the financial and
   organizational implications of TVMT. Administrators responded to these
   problems by delegating responsibilities to departments, reallocating
   tasks, learning from other hospitals and scaling up their teaching
   facilities. Conclusions: Hospital administrators perceived the
   implementation of TVMT as challenging. TVMT affects the existing
   equilibrium between education and clinical service. Administrators'
   initial attempts to regain control, using steering strategies that were
   based on known concepts and general outcomes, including cutting
   departmental budgets did not work, nor did their subsequent wait-and-see
   approach of leaving the implementation to the individual departments.},

Title = {An Online English Writing Evaluation System Using Deep Learning
   Algorithm},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {AUG 12},
Abstract = {In English writing, automatic evaluation systems are becoming more and
   more common and are receiving more and more attention. As a teaching
   application, an automatic evaluation system uses information
   technologies such as corpus and artificial intelligence to quickly score
   and modify students' writing. To expedite the realization of teaching
   information, this system records students' writing processes, which are
   closely related to the instruction requirements of the college's English
   program and meets the personalized needs by combining the current
   situation of English writing and teaching. This study investigates the
   impact of field cognitive style and automatic evaluation system on
   college writing training. From the perspective of cognitive style
   differences, this paper summarizes the application strategies of an
   automatic evaluation system in College English writing and teaching, to
   better realize the integration of information technology and subject
   teaching and improve students' English writing ability and level. The
   deep learning-based system for grading students in the classroom is
   completed by this paper. The network data transmission module allows
   several ends to all experience stable data interaction.},

Title = {The longitudinal association between engagement and achievement varies
   by time, students? profiles, and achievement state: A full program study},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {199},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {There is a paucity of longitudinal studies in online learning across
   courses or throughout pro-grams. Our study intends to add to this
   emerging body of research by analyzing the longitudinal trajectories of
   interaction between student engagement and achievement over a full
   four-year program. We use learning analytics and life-course methods to
   study how achievement and engagement are intertwined and how such
   relationship evolves over a full program for 106 students. Our findings
   have indicated that the association between engagement and achievement
   varies between students and progresses differently between such groups
   over time. Our results showed that online engagement at any single
   time-point is not a consistent indicator for high achievement. It takes
   more than a single point of time to reliably forecast high achievement
   throughout the program. Longitudinal high grades, or longitudinal high
   levels of engagement (either separately or combined) were indicators of
   a stable academic trajectory in which students remained engaged -at
   least on average- and had a higher level of achievement. On the other
   hand, disengagement at any time point was consistently associated with
   lower achievement among low-engaged students. Improving to a higher
   level of engagement was associated with -at least- acceptable
   achievement levels and rare dropouts. Lack of improvement or ``catching
   up{''} may be a more ominous sign that should be proactively addressed.},

Abstract = {Education research is increasingly being recognized as a legitimate
   route for faculty development in universities. However, many anatomy
   faculty lack the appropriate training and access to experienced mentors
   who can help them develop their own education research projects.
   Inspired by the American Physiological Society's Institute for Teaching
   and Learning, the coauthors proposed and developed the inaugural Anatomy
   Education Research Institute (AERI 2017). Funded by an American
   Association of Anatomists Innovations grant, the five-day institute was
   held in Bloomington, Indiana in July 2017. The coauthors spent two years
   preparing the conference schedule, inviting speakers who could discuss
   education research topics and mentor applicants, reviewing applications,
   developing assessment instruments for the institute, and hosting the
   institute. A total of 62 registered participants (applicants and invited
   speakers) attended AERI 2017. Through a series of presentations and
   workshops, participants were introduced to many aspects of education
   research and the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, including
   developing rigorous education research questions, determining
   appropriate methods to assess these questions, and searching the
   education research literature. Each day also included regular time
   devoted to work on their own education research project with help from
   more experienced mentors. Throughout the conference, participants were
   encouraged to post information on Twitter, using the hashtag \#AERI2017.
   Participants had strong positive impressions of the conference and
   strongly requested future AERI conferences be held. Follow-up analyses
   will assess the institute in alignment with Kirkpatrick's Four Levels of
   Evaluation Model, though preliminary evaluation indicates AERI 2017 met
   the original aims of the proposal.},

Title = {Predicting Intentions of Students for Master Programs Using a
   Chaos-Induced Sine Cosine-Based Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {67235-67248},
Abstract = {One of the essential tasks for the planning and development of talents
   training programs in different colleges of universities is to find how
   we can reasonably guide students to pursue a master's degree concerning
   their comprehensive situations. The purpose of this study is to develop
   a modified fuzzy k-Nearest Neighbor (FKNN) framework to predict the
   college students' intentions for master programs in advance, that is,
   students choose to attend the postgraduate exam or find a job after
   graduation. The proposed integrated framework combines the random forest
   (RF), FKNN, and a new chaos-enhanced sine cosine-inspired algorithm
   (CESCA). In this model, RF is employed to evaluate the importance of
   features in the dataset, while the FKNN is utilized to establish the
   relationship framework between the features and the college students'
   decisions to earn a master's degree or not. The proposed CESCA is
   utilized to tune the key parameters of the FKNN automatically. All eight
   variants of SCA have been rigorously compared based on 13 benchmark
   problems to validate the effectiveness of the proposed CESCA. Then, the
   CESCA-based FKNN (CESCA-FKNN) has been further compared against the
   other three classical classifiers in terms of four common performance
   metrics. The experimental results indicate that the proposed CESCA-FKNN
   can obtain the best classification accuracy. The results indicate that
   the established adaptive FKNN framework can be served as a powerful tool
   for college students' intention before pursuing a master's degree.},
