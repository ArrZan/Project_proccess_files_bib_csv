Abstract = {Postgraduate residencies utilize academic half-days to supplement
   clinical learning. Spaced repetition reinforces taught content to
   improve retention. We leveraged spaced repetition in a curriculum
   companion for a paediatric residency program's half-day. One half-day
   lecture was chosen weekly for reinforcement (day 0). Participants
   received 3 key points on day 1 and a multiple-choice question (MCQ) on
   day 8. On day 29, they received two MCQs to test reinforced and
   unreinforced content from the same day 0. Thirty-one (79\%) residents
   participated over 17 weeks, but only 14 (36\%) completed more than half
   of the weekly quizzes. Of all quizzes, 37.4\% were completed, with an
   average weekly engagement of 5.5 minutes. Helpfulness to learning was
   rated as 7.89/10 on a Likert-like scale. Reported barriers were missing
   related half-days and emails, or limited time. There was no significant
   difference in performance between reinforced (63.4\%, {[}53.6-73.3]) and
   unreinforced (65.6\%, {[}53.7-73.2]) questions. Spaced repetition is a
   proven strategy in learning science, but was not shown to improve
   performance. Operational barriers likely limited participation and
   underpowered our analysis, therefore future implementation must consider
   practical and individual barriers to facilitate success. Our results
   also illustrate that satisfaction alone is an inadequate marker of
   success.},

Abstract = {The objective of this research was to investigate the effect of a
   context-based approach (CBA) `Relating, Experiencing, Applying,
   Cooperating, Transferring' (REACT) strategy used in relation to the
   topic of solubility equilibrium in the laboratory chemistry course on
   students' achievement at associate level in a health-related program. In
   this regard, two contexts related to the topic of solubility equilibrium
   were developed and applied. The study had pre-test post-test with a
   control group research design and the participants consisted of
   sophomore students studying in the Medical Laboratory Techniques (MLT)
   and the Pharmacy Services (PS) Programs of the Ahmet Erdogan Vocational
   School of Health Services at Bulent Ecevit University (N = 96). The
   students enrolled in the MLT program were randomly assigned as the
   experimental group (n = 47) and the students in the PS program were
   randomly assigned as the control group (n = 49). The experimental group
   was taught solubility equilibrium by a CBA REACT strategy, whereas the
   control group was taught the relevant topic by conventional teaching.
   The `Equilibrium of Solubility Achievement Test (ESAT)' and `Structured
   Interview Form' were used as data collection tools in the research. The
   results of content analysis of ESAT post-test showed that the frequency
   of answers in the sound understanding category was higher for the
   experimental group compared to the control group students. In addition,
   the results of Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon tests of the ESAT indicated
   that post-test scores were higher in both groups compared to pre-test
   scores and the increase was higher in the experimental group compared to
   the control group. The content analysis results of structured interview
   form and semi-structured interviews showed that the students expressed
   positive views concerning the instruction and the qualities of the
   contexts in general. In this research, it was concluded that the CBA
   REACT strategy used in relation to the topic of solubility equilibrium
   in the laboratory chemistry course improved students' sound
   understanding and achievement and helped them develop positive views
   regarding the instruction and the quality of the contexts.},

Abstract = {Recommended approaches to promoting children's physical activity through
   schools call for physical education teachers to serve as champions for,
   and leaders of, Comprehensive School Physical Activity Programs
   (CSPAPs). Little evidence, however, exists to suggest that physical
   education teachers are ideally prepared or supported to assume CSPAP
   leadership roles. The purpose of this article is to consider
   expectations that must be met for physical education teachers to serve
   as central protagonists in CSPAP implementation efforts, and to propose
   a conceptual model aimed at increasing both effectiveness and
   sustainability of CSPAPs through key external-internal partnerships.
   Specifically, community-based participatory research, communities of
   practice, and service-learning are presented as possible strategies to
   expand the support system for growing and sustaining CSPAPs. In sum,
   this article offers some reasons for rethinking current recommendations
   for CSPAP implementation.},

Title = {Using a Professional Development Program for Enhancing Chilean Biology
   Teachers' Understanding of Nature of Science (NOS) and Their Perceptions
   About Using History of Science to Teach NOS},

Abstract = {A number of authors have recognized the importance of understanding the
   nature of science (NOS) for scientific literacy. Different instructional
   strategies such as decontextualized, hands-on inquiry, and history of
   science (HOS) activities have been proposed for teaching NOS. This
   article seeks to understand the contribution of HOS in enhancing biology
   teachers' understanding of NOS, and their perceptions about using HOS to
   teach NOS. These teachers (N = 8), enrolled in a professional
   development program in Chile are, according to the national curriculum,
   expected to teach NOS, but have no specific NOS and HOS training.
   Teachers' views of NOS were assessed using the VNOS-D+ questionnaire at
   the beginning and at the end of two modules about science instruction
   and NOS. Both the pre- and the post-test were accompanied by interviews,
   and in the second session we collected information about teachers'
   perceptions of which interventions had been more significant in changing
   their views on NOS. Finally, the teachers also had to prepare a lesson
   plan for teaching NOS that included HOS. Some of the most important
   study results were: significant improvements were observed in teachers'
   understanding of NOS, although they assigned different levels of
   importance to HOS in these improvements; and although the teachers
   improved their understanding of NOS, most had difficulties in planning
   lessons about NOS and articulating historical episodes that incorporated
   NOS. The relationship between teachers' improved understanding of NOS
   and their instructional NOS skills is also discussed.},

Abstract = {Background The use of simulated patients (SPs) is considered a
   significant resource for teaching and assessing clinical and
   communication skills in health professional education. We conducted this
   study to explore pharmacy students' perspective towards the utilization
   of SPs in Qatar and to identify areas that require improvement. Methods
   An explanatory sequential mixed-methods design was used among students
   and recent graduates of the College of Pharmacy at Qatar University
   (QU-CPH). First, their perspectives toward the current utilization of
   SPs at QU-CPH was explored using a quantitative cross-sectional study
   design. Following this, we conducted six focus group discussions based
   on the analysis of the questionnaire results. The findings of the two
   phases were interpreted through integration of the quantitative and
   qualitative phases. Results The majority of the participants (> 90\%)
   reported that interactions with SPs are important in building good
   communication and counseling skills during professional skills course
   activities. Similarly, most of the respondents (80\%) indicated that
   interactions with SPs prepared them to apply the clinical skills gained
   during professional skills and patient assessment sessions in real-life.
   In addition, they reported that interactions with SPs during
   competency-based assessments were good experiences. The participants
   disagreed with the notion that interaction with SPs of opposite gender
   was uncomfortable for them. Themes identified from the focus groups
   include: interactions with trained SPs compared to faculty SPs,
   standardization and consistency of SPs' roles, communication and
   language barriers, simulations of real-life case scenarios, SPs'
   competence and preparedness, psychological impact associated with
   interaction with SPs, proposed strategies for improving the SP program.
   Identified areas for improvement include the need for strengthening the
   SP training and orientation program as well as the SP selection
   criteria. Conclusion This study showed a positive impact of the
   utilization of SPs in this pharmacy curriculum as perceived by students
   and alumni. However, the SP program needs to be optimized in terms of
   the training and orientation of SPs.},

Abstract = {Simulation and team-based learning are reported as useful strategies in
   nursing education. However, empirical evidence on the effects of
   participating in an integrated course of team-based learning and
   simulation is limited. The aim of this study was to identify the effects
   of a nursing simulation program with team-based learning on knowledge,
   team performance, and teamwork among Korean nursing students. A
   one-group pretest-posttest design was used. Fourth-year students (N =
   229) participated in a 32-hour nursing simulation program with
   team-based learning. Each of the three sessions of the program involved
   a 3-hour task training with video-assisted learning and skills
   performance assessment, 1-hour team-based learning, and 4-hour
   simulation session with a high-fidelity simulator. In addition to the
   knowledge test and performance assessment, participants completed a
   self-administered questionnaire on teamwork. Participants achieved
   higher scores in the Group Readiness Assurance Test than they did in the
   Individual Readiness Assurance Test. The posttest scores on team
   performance and teamwork were significantly higher than their pretest
   scores. The simulation with team-based learning induced favorable
   effects on participants' knowledge, performance, and teamwork. A
   curricular integration of simulation program with team-based learning is
   consistent with achieving outcomes-based learning in nursing education.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {20712-20721},
Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel network representation learning model
   TransPath to encode heterogeneous information networks (HINs).
   Traditional network representation learning models aim to learn the
   embeddings of a homogeneous network. TransPath is able to capture the
   rich semantic and structure information of a HIN via meta-paths. We take
   advantage of the concept of translation mechanism in knowledge graph
   which regards a meta-path, instead of an edge, as a translating
   operation from the first node to the last node. Moreover, we propose a
   user-guided meta-path sampling strategy which takes users' preference as
   a guidance, which could explore the semantics of a path more precisely,
   and meanwhile improve model efficiency via the avoidance of other noisy
   and meaningless meta-paths. We evaluate our model on two large-scale
   real-world data sets database systems and logic programming (DBLP) and
   YELP, and two benchmark tasks similarity search and node classification.
   We observe that TransPath outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines
   consistently and significantly.},

Title = {Evaluation of strategies designed to enhance student engagement and
   success of indigenous midwifery students in an Away-From-Base Bachelor
   of Midwifery Program in Australia: A qualitative research study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},

Abstract = {Background: A strategy to close the gap in relation to Indigenous health
   is the employment of more Indigenous health professionals. However,
   despite government reviews, research studies and educational
   initiatives, Indigenous students' retention and completion rates of
   tertiary education remains below those of non-Indigenous Australians.
   Objective: To evaluate two enhancements to an Away-from-Base Bachelor of
   Midwifery program for Indigenous students, namely the appointment of an
   Indigenous Academic Liaison Midwife to provide academic and cultural
   support and an additional clinical placement in a high-volume tertiary
   hospital.
   Method: In this qualitative study, 10 Indigenous students enrolled in
   the Away-from-Base Bachelor of Midwifery program participated in one of
   two focus groups. Focus group transcriptions were subjected to a manual
   thematic analysis, and key themes were identified and explored.
   Findings: The role of the Indigenous Academic Liaison Midwife was highly
   valued as students had access to a resource who provided cultural and
   academic support, and who encouraged and advocated for them. Regular
   contact with the Indigenous Academic Liaison Midwife enabled students to
   stay connected with and focussed on their study. Students were
   overwhelmingly positive about the opportunity to undertake the
   additional clinical placement, as it exposed them to complex clinical
   cases they may not have seen in their home communities.
   Conclusions: The introduction of an Indigenous Academic Liaison Midwife
   and an additional clinical placement in a high-volume tertiary hospital
   were perceived as valuable additions to the range of support mechanisms
   already in place for Indigenous Away-from-Base Bachelor of Midwifery
   students. These interventions have had a direct impact on retention,
   course progression and completion rates for Indigenous students.
   Students expressed enhanced clinical learning and knowledge retention as
   a result of the additional clinical placement, and the Indigenous
   Academic Liaison Midwife provided culturally sensitive support for
   students undertaking remote learning, and during on-campus intensive
   sessions.},

Abstract = {Beginning in 2005, the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program at the
   University of California underwent major curricular review and reform.
   To provide information for others that follow, we have documented our
   process and commented on factors that were critical to success, as well
   as factors we found surprising, difficult, or problematic. The review
   and reform were initiated by the Executive Committee, who led the
   process and commissioned the committees. The planning stage took 6 years
   and involved four faculty committees, while the implementation stage
   took 5 years and was led by the Curriculum Committee. We are now in year
   2 of the institutionalizing stage and no longer refer to our reform as
   the ``new curriculum.'' The change was driven by a desire to improve the
   curriculum and the learning environment of the students by aligning the
   delivery of information with current teaching methodologies and
   implementing adult learning strategies. We moved from a department-and
   discipline-based curriculum to a school-wide integrated block curriculum
   that emphasized student-centered, inquiry-based learning. A limit was
   placed on in-class time to allow students to apply classroom knowledge
   by solving problems and cases. We found the journey long and arduous,
   requiring tremendous commitment and effort. In the change process, we
   learned the importance of adequate planning, leadership, communication,
   and a reward structure for those doing the ``heavy lifting.'' Specific
   to our curricular design, we learned the importance of the block leader
   role, of setting clear expectations for students, and of partnering with
   students on the journey.},

Title = {Machine learning for surgical time prediction},
Journal = {COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {208},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background and Objective: Operating Rooms (ORs) are among the most
   expensive services in hospitals. A challenge to optimize the OR
   efficiency is to improve the surgery scheduling task, which requires the
   estimation of surgical time duration. Surgeons or programming units
   (based on people's experience) typically do the duration estimation
   using an experience-based strategy, which may include some bias, such as
   overestimating the surgery time, increasing ORs' operational cost.
   Methods: This paper analyzes a machine learning-based solution for
   surgical time predictions. We apply and compare four machine-learning
   algorithms (Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, Regression
   Trees, and Bagged Trees) to predict the surgical time duration at a
   tertiary referral university hospital in Bogota, Colombia. Historical
   data from 2004 until 2019 was used to train the algorithms. Comparison
   among algorithms was given in terms of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
   of the predicted surgery duration and the algorithms' computing time.
   The algorithm with the best performance was compared to the currently
   used experience-based method. Results: All the ML algorithms predict the
   surgery duration with an error between 26 and 37 min. The best overall
   performance was obtained using Bagged Trees (26 min RMSE, 3.16 min
   training time, 0.49 min testing time) when using a subset of the DB with
   the nine specialties containing 80\% of the surgeries. Bagged Trees also
   outperformed the experience-based method with a lower RMSE; however, it
   also shifted from a predominant overestimation to underestimating
   surgeries' duration. Conclusions: Different ML algorithms for predicting
   the surgical time duration, showing and comparing their performance.
   Bagged Trees showed the best performance in terms of RMSE and computing
   time. Depending on the initial data, Bagged Trees outperformed the
   experience-based method, but future work is necessary to suit it, like
   any other ML algorithm, to the hospitals' needs. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Background This study presents an experiment regarding the introduction
   of gamification strategies in occupational therapy courses. Based on
   previous studies, the objective is to adapt the idea of recreational
   escape rooms to educational environments of health sciences like
   occupational therapy to increase student motivation and promote
   game-based learning and key skills, such as teamwork. Methods Computer
   software was created for a collaborative escape room which allows
   on-line simultaneous play of up to 24-30 students. It was tested three
   times in an occupational therapy degree program with 75 students and it
   was based on two different subjects, although it can be adapted to
   others. The escape room was evaluated using feedback surveys and
   comparing students' performances before and after the game. Descriptive
   exploratory statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 24.
   Results An appropriate use of educational escape rooms can have
   significant positive impacts on students' engagement and learning.
   Students were found to prefer using gamification tools in their
   learning. Their degrees of satisfaction exceeded their expectations.
   Conclusions Educational escape rooms may have a positive impact on
   students' motivation and a statistically significant improvement of test
   scores after playing was found. Comments from the feedback surveys were
   used to improve successive versions of the software and design of the
   game.},

Abstract = {To solve the current problem concerning the education and skills gap of
   college students as well as to cultivate mold design talent in line with
   Industry 4.0 for the mold industry, this study established a mold design
   concurrent system program using the conceive-design-implement-operate
   (CDIO) teaching model and assessed the effectiveness of the model
   through program implementation. First, the development trends of the
   mold industry in Taiwan and the human resources strategy of the smart
   mold manufacturing industry of Industry 4.0 were investigated to explore
   the standard of engineering talent in the industry and create a
   competency indicator for mold design concurrent systems to serve as an
   essential reference for curriculum planning and the criteria for
   learning outcome assessments. Second, the scope covered by the mold
   industry in the product life cycle was used as the blueprint for
   developing the curriculum. Finally, the CDIO curriculum design principle
   was applied to the design of the integrated curriculum module.
   Experimental teaching was conducted in the Bachelor's Program in
   Precision System Design at Feng Chia University in Taiwan for 18 weeks.
   A total of 54 sophomores participated in the experimental program and
   the product research and development project entitled ``Design and
   transformation of older-adult-friendly living supplies{''} to experience
   the entire process of CDIO. The curriculum consisted of a total of seven
   courses and six teachers (including three industry experts) and offered
   15 credits. Moreover, this study used the competency indicator scale in
   the pre- and post-tests to evaluate the effectiveness of the
   experimental teaching. At the end of the semester, a student program
   satisfaction survey was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the
   curriculum design and implementation. The results revealed that the
   students' competency indicators exhibited significant progress in
   understanding the professional technology of molds, using CAX software,
   and understanding concurrent system engineering capabilities. Moreover,
   the students were highly satisfied with the program, and the item ``The
   engineering practice of the integrated curriculum is helpful for my
   future academic progression and employment needs{''} received the
   highest level of satisfaction. This program was proven effective for
   cultivating excellent mold design talent for the industry, thereby
   bridging the mismatch between knowledge and application among university
   graduates and serving as a great example for higher-level engineering
   education reform.},

Title = {Performance Change in Treating Tobacco Addiction: An Online,
   Interprofessional, Facilitated Continuing Education Course (TEACH)
   Evaluation at Moore's Level 5},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTINUING EDUCATION IN THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Introduction: Continuing education is essential to build capacity among
   health care providers (HCPs) to treat people with tobacco addiction.
   Online, interprofessional training programs are valuable; however,
   interpretation and comparison of outcomes remain challenging because of
   inconsistent use of evaluation frameworks. In this study, we used level
   5 of Moore's evaluation framework to examine whether an online training
   program in intensive tobacco cessation counseling achieved sustained
   performance change among HCPs across multiple health disciplines.
   Methods: The evaluation sample included 62 HCPs with direct clinical
   duties, who completed the online Training Enhancement in Applied
   Counseling and Health (TEACH) Core Course in 2015 and 2016. We compared
   self-reported changes in cessation counseling and clinical practices
   across eight core competencies from baseline to 6-month follow-up using
   McNemar's tests and descriptive analyses. Results: Compared with
   baseline, significantly more HCPs reported providing cessation
   counseling at 6-month follow-up (44\% versus 81\%, P < .001). HCPs also
   reported significant increases in engagement in six of the eight core
   competencies. Discussion: Online training in intensive tobacco cessation
   treatment can result in sustained performance improvement at 6 months.
   However, availability of resources and clinical context may influence
   the extent to which HCPs are able to implement their learned skills.
   Furthermore, continuing education programs should consider the use of
   consistent evaluation frameworks to promote cross program comparisons.},

Abstract = {Background Intra-regional cultural and linguistic differences are common
   in low- and middle-income countries. To sensitise undergraduate medical
   students to the social and contextual determinants of health to achieve
   the `health for all' goal, these countries must focus on innovative
   teaching methods. The early introduction of a Community Orientation
   Program (COP) as a Community-based Medical Education (CBME) method could
   be a game changing strategy. In this paper the methods, evaluation, and
   implication of the COP in an Indian setting are described. Methods The
   curriculum of the COP was developed based on the analysis, design,
   development, implementation, and evaluation (ADDIE) model for
   educational intervention. In this learner-centric and supervised
   educational program, the key aim was to focus on developing students'
   communication skills, observation power and enhancing their motivation
   for learning through collaborative learning. To meet the objectives of
   the COP, a situated learning model under the constructivism theory was
   adopted. Results Between 2016 and 2019, 557 students were trained
   through the COP by visiting more than 1300 households in ten villages.
   To supplement the students' observations in the community, more than 150
   small group discussions, a health education programme for the community
   and summary presentations were conducted. The students' feedback
   indicated the need to improve the clinical examinations demonstration
   quality and increase the number of instruments for clinical
   examinations. More than 80\% of students felt that the program would
   assist them to improve their communication skills, their understanding
   of the various socio-demographic factors associated with the common
   diseases, and it will enable them to respect the local culture during
   their clinical practice. Conclusions Early initiation of the COP as a
   CBME method in the undergraduate medical curriculum in an Indian setting
   has shown promising results. Further evidence is required to adopt such
   a program routinely for under-graduate medical teaching in the low- and
   middle- income settings.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Teaching and training surgeons work hard in the OR to
   understand each other, yet miscommunication is an important cause of
   preventable adverse events in surgery. Our objective was to perform a
   formal semantic analysis of language in authentic teaching surgical
   cases, identify the prevalence and typology of ambiguous or potentially
   ambiguous language, and describe their potential for miscommunication.
   DESIGN: In this secondary analysis of qualitative data, we collaborated
   with a semanticist, categorizing linguistic phenomena often associated
   with miscommunication. We defined an ambiguous phenomenon as a string of
   language that could be reasonably interpreted in more than one way. We
   analyzed transcripts of 319 minutes of surgery, coding for 14 linguistic
   categories. Cohen's kappa was calculated. We determined the prevalence
   and rate of each linguistic category and chose illustrative examples.
   PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Six surgical attendings, four fellows, and six
   residents, ranging from PGY1 to PGY4, at the University of Pittsburgh
   Medical Center, a tertiary medical center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
   RESULTS: We found 3912 examples of potentially ambiguous language, 12.3
   per minute. Percentage agreement between two expert raters was 76.3\%.
   The most common phenomena were deixis (3.1 per minute), directional
   (2.6), anaphora (1.3), implicit instruction (1.3), and degree modifiers
   (0.7). Restatements/reframing occurred 1.4 times per minute. We
   identified 131 near misses associated with potentially ambiguous
   language. Cohen's kappa was 0.70 among expert semanticists. CONCLUSIONS:
   Potentially ambiguous language is common and has the potential to
   jeopardize safe teaching surgery. We postulate that the high amount of
   potentially ambiguous language use in the operating room places a burden
   on the training surgeon to comprehend surgical instruction. ((C) 2021

Title = {A Discount-Based Time-of-Use Electricity Pricing Strategy for Demand
   Response With Minimum Information Using Reinforcement Learning},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {54018-54028},
Abstract = {Demand Response (DR) programs show great promise for energy saving and
   load profile flattening. They bring about an opportunity for indirect
   control of end-users' demand based on different price policies. However,
   the difficulty in characterizing the price-responsive behavior of
   customers is a significant challenge towards an optimal selection of
   these policies. This paper proposes a Demand Response Aggregator (DRA)
   for transactive policy generation by combining a Reinforcement Learning
   (RL) technique on the aggregator side with a convex optimization problem
   on the customer side. The proposed DRA can maintain users' privacy by
   exploiting the DR as the only source of information. In addition, it can
   avoid mistakenly penalizing users by offering price discounts as an
   incentive to realize a satisfying multi-agent environment. With an
   ensured convergence, the resultant DRA is capable of learning adaptive
   Time-of-Use (ToU) tariffs and generating near-to-optimal price policies.
   Moreover, this study suggests an off-line training procedure that can
   deal with issues related to the convergence time of RL algorithms. The
   suggested process can notably expedite the DRA convergence and, in turn,
   enable online applications. The developed method is applied to a set of
   residential agents in order to benefit them by regulating their thermal
   loads according to generated price policies. The efficiency of the
   proposed approach is thoroughly evaluated from the standpoint of the
   aggregator and customers in terms of load shifting and comfort
   maintenance, respectively. Besides, the superior performance of the
   selected RL method is represented through a comparative study. An
   additional assessment is also conducted by use of a coordination
   algorithm to validate the competitiveness of the recommended DR program.
   The multifaceted evaluation demonstrates that the designed scheme can
   significantly improve the quality of the aggregated load profile with a
   low reduction in the aggregator's income.},

Abstract = {In the field of bioinformatics, a large number of classical software
   becomes a necessary research tool. To measure the influence of
   scientific software as one kind of important intellectual products, a
   few strategies have been proposed to identify the software names from
   full texts of papers to collect the usage data of packages in
   bioinformatics research. However, the performance of these strategies is
   limited because of the highly imbalance of data in the full texts. This
   study proposes EnsembleSVMs-CRF, a two-step refinement strategy based on
   ensemble learning that gradually increases the sentences that contain
   software mentions to improve the performance of named entity
   recognition. The experiment on the bioinformatics corpus shows that the
   performance of EnsembleSVMs-CRF, in terms of the local F1 (78.81\%) and
   the global F1-A (73.49\%), is superior to the rule-based bootstrapping
   method and direct CRF. Application of this strategy to the articles
   published between 2013 and 2017 in 27 bioinformatics journals extracted
   8,239 unique packages. The most popular 50 packages thus identified
   demonstrate that most of them are professional software which generally
   requires inter-discipline knowledge, rather than programming skill.
   Meanwhile, we found that researchers in bioinformatics tend to use free
   scientific software, and the application of general software is
   increasing compared with professional software.},

Title = {Strategies From 11 US Medical Schools for Integrating Basic Science Into

Abstract = {Calls for curricular reform in medical schools and enhanced integration
   of basic and clinical science have resulted in a shift toward
   preclerkship curricula that enhance the clinical relevance of
   foundational science instruction and provide students with earlier
   immersion in the clinical environment. These reforms have resulted in
   shortened preclerkship curricula, yet the promise of integrated basic
   science education into clerkships has not been sufficiently realized
   because of barriers such as the nature of clinical practice, time
   constraints, and limited faculty knowledge. As personalized medicine
   requires that physicians have a more nuanced understanding of basic
   science, this is cause for alarm. To address this problem, several
   schools have developed instructional and assessment strategies to better
   integrate basic science into the clinical curriculum. In this article,
   faculty and deans from 11 U.S. medical schools discuss the strategies
   they implemented and the lessons they learned to provide guidance to
   other schools seeking to enhance basic science education during
   clerkships. The strategies include program-level interventions (e.g.,
   longitudinal sessions dedicated to basic science during clerkships,
   weeks of lessons dedicated to basic science interspersed in clerkships),
   clerkship-level interventions (e.g., case-based learning with online
   modules, multidisciplinary clerkship dedicated to applied science),
   bedside-level interventions (e.g., basic science teaching scripts,
   self-directed learning), and changes to formative and summative
   assessments (e.g., spaced repetition/leveraging test-enhanced learning,
   developing customized examinations). The authors discovered that:
   interventions were more successful when buy-in from faculty and students
   was considered, central oversight by curricular committees collaborating
   with faculty was key, and some integration efforts may require schools
   to provide significant resources. All schools administered the United
   States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 exam to students after
   clerkship, with positive outcomes. The authors have demonstrated that it
   is feasible to incorporate basic science into clinical clerkships, but
   certain challenges remain.},

Abstract = {Using current research and real-life scenarios to motivate students to
   understand chemistry principles is a key strategy in learning and
   teaching. An illustration of psychoactive drugs referred to as ``legal
   highs{''} used in the U.K. and Europe is presented to highlight key
   chemistry principles and relate the importance of chemistry research in
   healthcare. Specific topics include stereochemistry, H-1 NMR
   characterization, organic `synthesis, and functional groups, which can
   be used in chemistry curricula for high school students and also in
   higher education programs. A contextualized example focused on
   mephedrone is used during an interpretative spectroscopy exercise in a
   second-year bioscience program. Student evaluations on the use of this
   case study approach were very positive. This topic on psychoactive drugs
   integrates chemistry in social and legal issues relating to patient
   safety. It highlights public awareness of ``legal highs{''} and the
   generalized perception that ``natural products{''} are safe and
   nontoxic.},

Title = {Challenges and Strategies for Educational Virtual Reality: Results of an
   Expert-led Forum on 3D/VR Technologies across Academic Institutions},
Journal = {INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND LIBRARIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4},
Pages = {25-48},
Abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) is a rich visualization and analytic platform that
   furthers the library's mission of providing access to all forms of
   information and supporting pedagogy and scholarship across disciplines.
   Academic libraries are increasingly adopting VR technology for a variety
   of research and teaching purposes, which include providing enhanced
   access to digital collections, offering new research tools, and
   constructing new immersive learning environments for students. This
   trend suggests that positive technological innovation is flourishing in
   libraries, but there remains a lack of clear guidance in the library
   community on how to introduce these technologies in effective ways and
   make them sustainable within different types of institutions. In June
   2018, the University of Oklahoma hosted the second of three forums on
   the use of 3D and VR for visualization and analysis in academic
   libraries, as part of the project Developing Library Strategy for 3D and
   Virtual Reality Collection Development and Reuse (LIB3DVR), funded by a
   grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services. This
   qualitative study invited experts from a range of disciplines and
   sectors to identify common challenges in the visualization and analysis
   of 3D data, and the management of VR programs, for the purpose of
   developing a national library strategy.},

Title = {Active set expansion strategies in MPRGP algorithm},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {149},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The paper investigates strategies for expansion of active set that can
   be employed by the MPRGP algorithm. The standard MPRGP expansion uses a
   projected line search in the free gradient direction with a fixed step
   length. Such a scheme is often too slow to identify the active set,
   requiring a large number of expansions. We propose to use adaptive step
   lengths based on the current gradient, which guarantees the decrease of
   the unconstrained cost function with different gradient-based search
   directions. Moreover, we also propose expanding the active set by
   projecting the optimal step for the unconstrained minimization.
   Numerical experiments demonstrate the benefits (up to 78\% decrease in
   the number of Hessian multiplications) of our expansion step
   modifications on two benchmarks - contact problem of linear elasticity
   solved by TFETI and machine learning problems of SVM type, both
   implemented in PERMON toolbox.},

Abstract = {One of the biggest challenges in modern engineering education is to
   raise awareness about the basic principles of process safety. Although
   several organizations such as AIChE through CCPS and SAChE, IChemE and
   ABET are trying to seek suitable learning environments, there is still
   lack of courses or programs aimed at making students conscious about
   accident causes and prevention. This paper presents a strategy to raise
   awareness in undergraduate engineering students about this topic. Our
   strategy consists of four educating modules that can be taught as part
   of core courses. We have implemented our strategy in 14 Colombian
   universities in five undergraduate engineering programs: Chemical,
   Industrial, Mechanical, Environmental, and Process Engineering. This
   pedagogical material was validated by experts in process safety from the
   Colombian Oil Company (ECOPETROL), faculty from various universities,
   and the Process Design group at Los Andes University. This proposed open
   education approach, which is a shared initiative between
   industry-academia, has been well received by all stakeholders. During
   2016, it has incorporated 28 faculty and the enrollment of more than
   1732 students. This process needs long-term sustainability to fulfill
   the primary purpose of including process safety in the engineer's
   education. (C) 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by

Title = {Effectiveness of evidence-based medicine training for undergraduate
   students at a Chinese Military Medical University: a self-controlled
   trial},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {Background: To evaluate the effect of the integration of evidence-based
   medicine (EBM) into medical curriculum by measuring undergraduate
   medical students' EBM knowledge, attitudes, personal application, and
   anticipated future use.
   Methods: A self-controlled trial was conducted with 251 undergraduate
   students at a Chinese Military Medical University, using a validated
   questionnaire regarding the students' evidence-based practice (EBP)
   about knowledge (EBP-K), attitude (EBP-A), personal application (EBP-P),
   and future anticipated use (EBP-F). The educational intervention was a
   20-hour EBM course formally included in the university's medical
   curriculum, combining lectures with small group discussion and
   student-teacher exchange sessions. Data were analyzed using paired
   t-tests to test the significance of the difference between a before and
   after comparison.
   Results: The difference between the pre- and post-training scores were
   statistically significant for EBP-K, EBP-A, EBP-P, and EBP-F. The scores
   for EBP-P showed the most pronounced percentage change after EBM
   training (48.97 +/- 8.6\%), followed by EBP-A (20.83 +/- 2.1\%), EBP-K
   (19.21 +/- 3.2\%), and EBP-F (17.82 +/- 5.7\%). Stratified analyses by
   gender, and program subtypes did not result in any significant changes
   to the results.
   Conclusions: The integration of EBM into the medical curriculum improved
   undergraduate medical students' EBM knowledge, attitudes, personal
   application, and anticipated future use. A well-designed EBM training
   course and objective outcome measurements are necessary to ensure the
   optimum learning opportunity for students.},

Abstract = {Attracting a general audience to STEM topics can be a challenge, and
   developing engaging and interactive instruction is important for
   educators in all fields. While many chemical educators have successfully
   used pop-culture themes to introduce their students to scientific
   concepts, these encounters are largely limited to formal classroom
   environments. Inspired by the successes of community science programs
   such as Science, Cafe and Nerd Nite, science educators from two Nebraska
   campuses sought to broaden the exposure of their pop-culture themed
   class lectures, and created the SciPop Talks! program. Now entering its
   fifth year, this informal educational outreach program has become a
   model of faculty/librarian partnerships and successful campus outreach.
   In this article, we discuss the program's formation, outline its
   strengths and challenges, and stress the importance of using
   interactivity to engage with learners. We report on findings from a
   survey of our attendees, which revealed surprising differences along
   gender lines. By sharing the motivations, strategies, operational
   specifics, outcomes, and future goals, we hope that scientists, science
   educators, outreach coordinators, and librarians will be inspired to
   launch their own SciPop Talks! programs.},

Abstract = {The effective prediction of stock market prices and trends is a critical
   topic in financial research for investors and stakeholders who wish to
   increase their return on investment. Motivated by highly unstable stock
   market targets and the continuous trading system that has been launched
   by Taiwan's stock market, this work develops an intelligent candlestick
   forecast system (ICFS), which combines the advantages of three
   forecasting techniques - single-point, interval value, and trend
   forecasting. The ICFS is simple and intuitive, using a sliding-window
   metaheuristic-optimized multi-output least squares support vector
   regression hybrid model scheme to forecast simultaneously four types of
   price information that are represented on a candlestick chart. Three
   parameter-free metaheuristic algorithms, namely teaching-learning-based
   optimization (TLBO), symbiotic organisms search (SOS), and
   forensic-based investigation (FBI), are in turn used to optimize the
   hyperparameters of the multi-output least squares support vector
   regression (MLSSVR) model, to increase its accuracy and stability in
   predicting stock prices. Benchmark data from relevant studies are used
   to compare the forecast performances of previously developed and the
   three proposed hybrid models. Among all tested models, the FBI-MLSSVR
   greatly outperforms the others in forecasting Standard \& Poor's (S\&P)
   and National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations
   (NASDAQ) indexes, Taiwan's exchange-traded funds, and major listed
   construction companies. A floating dollar-cost averaging strategy for
   maximizing returns while minimizing investment risks is proposed and
   compared with traditional dollar-cost averaging and the buy-and-hold
   strategy. The profitability of the predictions made using the proposed
   system is verified against actual stock market operations. The ICFS is
   packaged as a visualized expert system and independent application
   program for the convenience of users, who can intuitively run it and
   interpret its forecasts. Therefore, this study is highly practical by
   providing stakeholders with an easy-to-use and accurate predictive
   tool.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Background The aim of this educational study was to investigate the use
   of interactive case-based modules relating to the screening and
   identification of early-stage inflammatory arthritis in both online
   technology (OLT) and paper (PF) formats with identical content. Methods
   Forty learners from family medicine or rheumatology residency programs
   were recruited. Content pertaining to a ``Sore Hands, Sore Feet{''}
   (SHSF) and Gait Arms Legs Spine (GALS) screening tool modules were
   selected, reviewed and developed based on a validated curriculum from
   the World Health Organization and Canadian Curriculum for MSK
   conditions. Both the SHSF module and GALS screening tool were assessed
   via a randomized control trial. Assessments were completed during an
   orientation with all learners; then prior to the intervention (T1); at
   the end of the module (T2) and 3 months following the modules (T3) to
   assess retention. Focus groups were conducted to determine learners'
   satisfaction with the different learning formats. Baseline data was
   collated, and analysis performed after randomization into the PF
   (control) and OLT (experimental) groups. Repeated measures ANOVA was
   used for statistical analyses. Results Forty participants were recruited
   and randomized into the PF or OLT group (n = 20 each). At 3 months,
   there were n = 31 participants for SHSF (PF n = 19, OLT n = 12) and n =
   32 for GALS (PF n = 19, OLT n = 13). There was no significant difference
   between the OLT and PF groups in both analyses. A significant increase
   in scores from Pre- to Post-Module in SHSF (F (1, 18) = 24.62. p <
   .0001) and GALS (F (1, 30) = 40.08, p < .0001) were identified to
   suggest learning occurred with both formats. The repeated measures ANOVA
   to assess retention revealed a significant decrease in scores from
   Post-Module to Follow-up for both learning format groups for SHSF (F (1,
   29) = 4.68. p = .039), and GALS (F (1, 30) = 18.27. p < .0001)
   suggesting 3 months may be too long to retain this educational
   information. Conclusions Both formats led to residents' ability to
   screen, identify and initially manage inflammatory arthritis. The
   hypothesis is rejected because both OLT and PF groups demonstrated
   significant learning during the process regardless of format. It is
   important to emphasize that from T1 (pre-module) to T2 (post-module),
   the residents demonstrated learning regardless of group to which they
   were assigned. However, learning retention declined from T2
   (post-module) to T3 (three-month follow-up). Regular review of knowledge
   may be required earlier than 3 months to retain information learned.
   This study may impact educational strategies in MSK health.},

Abstract = {Analyzing learners' learning behaviors helps teachers understand how
   learning behaviors of learners influence learning performance. To
   determine which learning behaviors influence learners' science-based
   inquiry learning performance, this work develops an xAPI (Experience
   Application Programming Interface)-based learning record store module
   embedded in a Collaborative Web-based Inquiry Science Environment
   (CWISE) to record detailed data about students' learning processes. This
   work discusses whether the significant correlation and cause-effect
   relationship among science inquiry competence, learning time, and
   learning performance exist, and examines whether remarkable shifts and
   differences in the learning behaviors of learners with different
   learning performances and inquiry competences exist by using sequential
   pattern mining and lag sequential analysis. The results demonstrate that
   inquire ability, total learning time in the designed inquiry learning
   course, and learning time in an inquiry buoyancy simulation experiment
   are positively correlated with learning performance and can predict
   learning performance, and the learning time in the inquiry buoyancy
   simulation experiment appears to be the most significant predictor. The
   results of lag sequential analyses indicate that learners with high
   learning performance and high inquiry competence re-adjust hypotheses
   after performing an inquiry buoyancy simulation experiment, while
   learners with low learning performance and low inquiry competence lack
   this critical inquiry learning behavior. This study presents a
   systematic analysis method to insight the effective learning behaviors
   in a web-based inquiry learning environment based on mining students'
   learning processes, thus providing potential benefits in guiding
   learners to adjust their learning behaviors and strategies.},

Abstract = {Computation-aware delay optimal mobility management (MM) is an important
   problem in ultra-dense network (UDN) with mobile edge computing (MEC).
   Since the additional time delay caused by task computation is not taken
   into consideration, traditional radio access-oriented mobility
   management scheme cannot guarantee the overall delay performance of
   delay-sensitive user equipment (UE). In this paper, we propose a novel
   dynamic programming-based mobility management (DPMM) scheme to minimize
   the average delay under an energy consumption constraint. DPMM makes MM
   decisions using statistic information to handle the inaccurate state
   information. Cooperative data transmission is adopted to improve the
   delay performance. Simulation shows that the proposed DPMM scheme can
   achieve delay performance close to optimal and reduce the frequency of
   handover. However, the wireless link, computation resources and UE's
   location in UDN environment is dynamic, which leads to information
   uncertainties. We further propose an MM scheme based on deep Q-network
   (DQN) to learn the system information from the environment. In this
   scheme, UE takes the current and past observed delay as experience,
   learning the optimal mobility management strategy through DQN training.
   Simulation shows that DQN-based MM can learn from experience and reduce
   the handover frequency to a certain degree.},

Abstract = {The general assembly meeting of the United Nations Educational,
   Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2015 adopted the 17
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aimed at achieving a better and
   more sustainable world by 2030. Incorporating sustainable values through
   a series of pedagogical strategies into university curricula to help
   future professionals enhance their understanding of sustainability and
   how they relate to it is one of the crucial steps to help achieve
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through education. Inspired by the
   principles of Green Analytical Chemistry (GAC) and the ``3R{''} (reduce,
   recycle, and reuse) approach, a laboratory experiment has been developed
   to illustrate the basic concept of reaction miniaturization step by
   step. This article presents a novel experimental design consisting of 7
   sessions, which includes all elements of the 3R approach. Herein,
   students miniaturize the conventional calorimetric determination of soil
   organic carbon (OC) and soil available phosphorus (P) utilizing recycled
   microtips and microcentrifuge tubes. Students apply their critical
   thinking abilities to compute and compare the waste generated, the
   analysis cost, and the time required for each test using the
   conventional approach (CA) and miniature approach (MA). They further
   assess the greenness of both approaches using the open-source Analytical
   GREEnness (AGREE) software. While students carry out these experiments,
   they acquire laboratory skills and reinforce their understanding of
   sustainability, Beer-Lambert law, how OC relates to the bioavailability
   of anionic nutrients such as PO43- phosphate species, and how such
   relationships can statistically vary based on the methods applied.
   Learning outcomes were assessed to evaluate the experimental design.},

Abstract = {The tribal communities in South India, especially those in the Wayanad
   region in the proximity of Kerala state, havelow literacy rates and
   occupy a socio-culturally marginalized statusamong various demographic
   clusters in India. The pedagogiesemployed through mainstream schooling
   do not appeal to thestudents in the tribal community, resulting in high
   dropout rates.Therefore, Madras Christian College, Chennai, has
   identified tribalcommunities as an underrepresented group in Indian
   scienceeducation proposing to engage them through{''}Service Learning
   Science Camps{''}. Herein we document our activities as
   formativeassessment through teaching chemistry to tribal school children
   and consolidate the experiences gained by both the studentvolunteers and
   tribal students for prospective research. The program enabled the
   student mentors to explore their leadership skillswhile administering
   the science camps. In addition to this, the camps created a pleasurable
   environment for learning chemistry forthe tribal children and increased
   their inclination toward science. This exercise helps students to change
   their perception towardtribals and bridge the gap between them by
   providing a welcoming and supportive environment for pleasurable
   learning. We proposethese camps as a model to reach out and popularize
   chemistry among the overlooked communities, simultaneously nurturing the
   minds of college students toward creating an inclusive future},

Title = {Interpreting log data through the lens of learning design: Second-order
   predictors and their relations with learning outcomes in flipped
   classrooms},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {168},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Flipped classrooms supported by learning management systems (LMS) have
   been widely adopted by educational institutions. However, earlier
   studies have found problems with interpreting LMS log data to understand
   student approaches to learning within the context of a learning design.
   This study investigates whether it is possible to use LMS log data as a
   proxy to understand students' learning strategies over different periods
   of time in the flipped-classroom context. A total of 135 sophomores from
   two classes of a flipped programming course participated in this study.
   Exploratory factor analysis is first conducted on the log data to
   synthesize second-order predictors based on the total-effort model.
   Then, we investigate the extent to which these second-order predictors
   relate to students' learning outcomes over time. Four types of learning
   outcomes are considered, including a quiz, a midterm exam, a final exam
   and the final grade. For each type of learning outcome, multiple linear
   regression is used to construct a weekly prediction model from these
   predictors. Adjusted R-squared and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) are the
   metrics used to compare the models. The results show that consistent
   second-order predictors can be derived from log data, implying that
   students' clicking events in LMS could manifest students' learning
   strategies understandable in the design context of a flipped classroom.
   Furthermore, compared with the first-order models, most of the models
   constructed using the second-order predictors have higher predictive
   performance, although with lower data fitness. In addition, the
   predictive performance of the models with MSLQ (Motivated Strategies for
   Learning Questionnaire) indicators and past assessment data are also
   examined. It is found that MSQL variables have a positive but
   short-termed effect on the models' predictive ability, while past
   assessment data greatly improve the models of all types of learning
   outcomes. Theoretical contributions and implications of the proposed
   approach for practice, research and future research are discussed.},

Abstract = {The goal of this paper is to study model-free data-driven control
   evaluation and design strategies for discrete-time linear time-invariant
   systems, where the system model is unknown. In particular, our main
   contribution is twofold: 1) new state-input exploration and data
   collection schemes from experiences; 2) new data-driven linear matrix
   inequalities and dynamic programming methods for stabilization and
   optimal control problems. The proposed exploration and data collection
   schemes theoretically guarantee to acquire sufficient information from
   the system's state-input trajectories that can solve the underlying
   control design problems. We prove that under mild assumptions, as more
   and more data is accumulated, the collected data can solve the problems
   with higher probability along with the proposed algorithms.},

Abstract = {In this paper, an optimization method based on adaptive dynamic
   programming is developed to improve the electricity consumption of rooms
   in office buildings through optimal battery management. Rooms in office
   buildings are generally divided into office rooms, computer rooms,
   storage rooms, meeting rooms, etc., and each category of rooms have
   different characteristics of electricity consumption, which is divided
   into electricity consumption from sockets, lights and air-conditioners
   in this paper. The developed method based on action-dependent heuristic
   dynamic programming is explained in detail, and different optimization

Abstract = {Wireless sensor network is a network that integrates sensor technology,
   computer technology, information processing technology, and
   communication technology. This paper aims to study how to analyze and
   study the routing optimization of wireless sensor network based on deep
   learning and describe the neural network. This paper puts forward the
   problem of routing optimization, which is based on the dynamic
   programming of wireless sensor network, and then elaborates around its
   concept and related algorithms and designs and analyzes the case of
   wireless sensor network optimization. Through the comparative analysis
   of the five algorithms in computer simulation, although the average
   network delay performance of DPER reached 0.47 s, it could effectively
   prolong the life cycle of the network. The DPER algorithm not only
   improves the network life but also improves the network energy
   utilization rate, shortens the average path length of the network, and
   reduces the standard deviation of the remaining energy of the node.},

Abstract = {Computer security has become one of the core areas according to IEEE
   Computer Society and ACM Joint Task Force curriculum guidelines for
   undergraduate degree programs in computer engineering and software
   engineering. At the University of Belgrade, School of Electrical
   Engineering there is a course called Computer Security that is taught to
   software engineering and computer engineering students for the past 9
   years. During this time a significant change was made to the course
   regarding the level of practical students' work. Several factors
   initiated the change: the recommendations in the curriculum guidelines,
   the analysis of the students' success at the exams, and the students'
   opinion. The impact of gradual transition from no practical activities
   at all to laboratory exercises and practical project at the course are
   described in this paper. Results show that the introduction of
   laboratory exercises at the course helped students to better understand
   some of the core areas and that the introduction of practical project
   increased their overall knowledge in the computer security area.},

Title = {The Professionalism and Integrity in Research Program: Description and
   Preliminary Outcomes},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},

Volume = {93},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Violations of rules and regulations in research can cause significant
   problems for human participants, animal subjects, data integrity,
   institutions, and investigators. The Professionalism and Integrity in
   Research Program (PI Program) provides remediation training that
   addresses the root causes of violations of rules and regulations in
   research. Through assessments, a three-day workshop, and follow-up
   coaching calls, the PI Program teaches evidence-based decision-making
   strategies designed to help researchers to compensate for bias,
   uncertainty, and work-related stress, and foster the skills needed to
   oversee research projects in today's complex regulatory environments.
   Across its first three years (2013-2015), the program trained 39
   researchers from 24 different institutions in the United States.
   Participant evaluations of the program's faculty and workshop content
   were highly positive (4.7-4.8 and 4.5-4.6, respectively, on a 5-point
   scale). Preliminary program outcome assessment using validated measures
   of professional decision making and cognitive distortions in a pre- and
   postworkshop design indicated significant improvements. A follow-up
   survey of participants found statistically significant increases in a
   variety of target behaviors, including training research staff members
   to foster compliance and research quality, using standard operating
   procedures to support compliance and research integrity, performing
   self-audits of research operations, reducing job stressors, actively
   overseeing the work of the research team, and seeking help when
   experiencing uncertainty. Assessment of the PI Program was conducted
   with modest sample sizes, yet evaluation, outcome assessment, and
   self-reported survey data provided statistically significant evidence of
   effectiveness in achieving program goals.},

Title = {Us and them: The experience of international nursing students engaged in
   team based learning: A qualitative descriptive study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {92},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: International students report multiple challenges adjusting
   to educational settings. Instructional strategies such as Team Based
   Learning (TBL), could provide international students with opportunities
   that promote academic success, language skills and social connectedness.
   However, little is known about international students' experience of
   TBL. The aim of this study was to explore culturally and linguistically
   diverse (CALD) students' experiences of TBL.
   Methods: This paper reports on a qualitative study that explored the
   experiences of 15 international students enrolled in an Australian
   university nursing program, where TBL is used.
   Results: Findings indicate that TBL promotes language proficiency and
   respectful intercultural connections. It also uncovered an unintentional
   benefit of TBL in interrupting racism towards international students
   from domestic students. However, it is not enough to rely on TBL to
   mitigate the impact of racial and cultural power dynamics in educational
   settings.
   Conclusion: To improve international student experiences, educators must
   actively engage students in dialogue about privilege and structural
   racism as it relates to international students and other people of
   colour.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Despite the growing importance of quality improvement (QI)
   training in medical education, there is a lack of faculty with expertise
   in QI at many academic medical centers. In this report, we describe the
   design, implementation, and evaluation of a QI training program for
   faculty in hospital medicine at an academic medical center aimed at
   increasing faculty capacity in QI. Methods: With input from an initial
   focus group of hospital medicine faculty, we developed a 12-session,
   active-learning curriculum incorporating core concepts in QI applied to
   a real-life QI problem. We used a survey instrument to assess changes in
   self-reported confidence, the Quality Improvement Knowledge Application
   Tool-Revised to assess changes in applied knowledge, and a second focus
   group to obtain qualitative feedback regarding the curriculum. Results:
   Self-reported confidence in numerous QI skills increased after
   completion of the curriculum; however, concurrent improvement in applied
   knowledge was not observed. Qualitatively, participants not only
   described improved understanding of QI methodology and greater
   confidence contributing to QI initiatives but also a sense they were not
   prepared to lead a QI project independently. Discussion: An
   active-learning faculty training program is feasible with limited
   resources and was associated with increased faculty confidence in QI
   skills.},

Title = {Turkish medical educators' TPACK components and characters: an analysis
   within the framework of simulation-based medical education},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {JUN 25},
Abstract = {BackgroundNowadays, a comprehensive approach is needed to describe the
   current status of the technology integration process and the
   identification of the factors that affect it, because the description
   and frame of the existing situation will be the starting point in the
   organization of the roadmap to the realization of an effective
   integration process. The purpose of this study is to identify the
   differences in technology integration of the medical educators working
   in Turkey and analyze these according to various variables on the basis
   of technological pedagogical content knowledge.MethodData used in the
   study were collected from 301 medical educators using the
   TPACK-Practical Scale and Attitude towards Technology Scale. The data
   were analyzed using Ward's minimum variance hierarchical clustering
   analysis, discriminant function analysis and multinomial logistic
   regression analysis.ResultsAccording to the results of the study,
   medical educators' technology integration was grouped in the following
   clusters, according to their TPACK: (i) activity-based, (ii) student-
   based and (iii) topic-based. It was found that the developed model
   explains 79\% of the variance of technology integration. The
   implementation of simulation-based medical education in medical school
   and the department where they work affect the clusters to which the
   medical educators were assigned, whereas the gender variable didn't have
   an effect. The findings showed that attitudes towards technology,
   simulation education and working in the field of basic medical sciences
   increased medical educators' activity-based presence.ConclusionsThe
   review of the clusters and their characteristics showed that there are
   similarities between the items used in the designing stage of the
   education programs and the relationships of these items among them.
   Learner centered approaches are based on the assumption that students
   are located at the center of the program. In these designs, teaching
   mostly focuses on the learner, rather than program, learning or
   administrative body. Individuals and their identities are crucial.},

Abstract = {An instructive software was developed and programmed as an educational
   aid for design of distillation tower and tray hydraulics using visual
   basic language. This user-friendly software can be used as an
   educational aid for undergraduate Chemical Engineering courses. This
   tool allows students to study the behavior of the distillation tower and
   explore the different mass transfer and unit operation features. The
   students will be able to perform many simulation exercises including the
   tower overall and interior design and predict the behavior of undesired
   phenomena such as weeping and flooding. The software environment
   facilitates students' learning by providing a step-by-step procedure and
   instructions that are consistent with standard course books. (c) 2016

Title = {Establishing a Deaf and American Sign Language Inclusive Residency
   Program},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},

Abstract = {Improving diversity in residency programs has been increasingly
   emphasized as a means to address gender, racial, and ethnic disparities
   in medicine. However, limited attention has been given to the potential
   benefits of training physicians with differences other than gender or
   race and ethnicity. Americans with a disability represent about 27\% of
   the U.S. population, whereas 1\%-3\% of physician trainees report having
   a disability. In 2013, a national survey identified only 86 physicians
   or trainees reporting deafness or hearing loss as a disability. To date,
   there are no published strategies on how to create an inclusive program
   for Deaf trainees. Herein, the authors report on the development of a
   Deaf and American Sign Language (ASL) inclusive residency program that
   can serve as an academic model for other programs, in any medical
   specialty, seeking to create an accessible training program for Deaf
   physicians and that can be adapted for trainees with other disabilities.
   In March 2017, the radiation oncology residency program at Johns Hopkins
   University matched an ASL-signing Deaf resident who would begin the
   program in July 2018. In preparation, department leadership engaged key
   stakeholders and leaders within the university's health system and among
   the department faculty, residents, and staff as well as the incoming
   resident to create an ASL inclusive program. A 5-step transition process
   for the training program was ultimately developed and implemented. The
   authors focused on engaging the Deaf trainee and interpreters, engaging
   health system and departmental leadership, contracting a training
   consultant and developing oral and written training materials for
   faculty and staff, and optimizing the workspace via accommodations.
   Through collaborative preparation, a Deaf and ASL-signing resident was
   successfully integrated into the residency program. The proposed 5-step
   transition process provides an effective, engaging model to encourage
   other institutions that are seeking to employ similar inclusivity
   initiatives.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the association
   between Spanish physical education teachers' perceived self-efficacy
   toward including overweight and obese students and their attitudes
   toward overweight and obese students. Method: Four hundred and
   seventy-one physical education teachers filled out questionnaires to
   assess their self-efficacy expectations to meet overweight and obese
   students' educational needs, and to identify physical education
   teachers' beliefs and attitudes toward these students. Results: The
   physical education teachers with a higher perceived self-efficacy in
   fostering participation and in assessing and promoting overweight and
   obese students' learning were more sensitive toward these students'
   fitness and healthcare and showed less pejorative attitudes toward
   overweight and obesity. Conclusions: These results highlight the need
   for teaching education programs capable of increasing the physical
   education teachers' perceived self-efficacy in this area. The results
   also show that there is a need for training for teachers and students in
   strategies aimed at reducing the cases of victimization of overweight
   and obese students.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The operating theatre (OT) is an important learning
   environment. Trainees face barriers to learning in the OT that may
   reduce meaningful educational interactions. The impact of these barriers
   on the intraoperative learning experience of trainees and the strategies
   that they employ to overcome them are not known. This qualitative study
   aimed to describe the intraoperative learning experiences of senior
   general surgery trainees in Australia and their strategies to optimize
   learning in the OT.
   DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: The authors developed a semi-structured
   interview guide based on published literature. Purposive sampling was
   used to identify a representative group of general surgery trainees in
   Australia, who were interviewed in a private setting with audio
   recordings deidentified for verbatim transcription and analysis.
   Thematic analysis was conducted using an interpretivist approach to
   produce a coding framework.
   RESULTS: Ten trainees participated in the study. Themes were divided
   into external and internal barriers to learning, promoters of effective
   learning and actions to facilitate learning. External barriers included
   cultural neglect of an important issue, with inadequate prioritization
   of teaching and a lack of structure for intraoperative learning. From
   this, we identified the theme of missed opportunities. Internal barriers
   included difficulties in developing assertiveness required to address
   these issues and a failure to adequately plan for learning, with
   reliance on the mentor to initiate. Actions to facilitate learning were
   rarely employed by trainees, as most were unaware of strategies to
   maximize intraoperative learning.
   CONCLUSIONS: Trainees find the barriers to learning in the OT difficult
   to address and are not well acquainted with strategies that may allow
   them to maximize their learning. (C) 2020 Association of Program

Abstract = {The VARK learning style is a pedagogical focus in health care education.
   This study examines relationships of course performance vs. VARK
   learning preference, study time, and career plan among students enrolled
   in an undergraduate anatomy and physiology course at a large urban
   university. Students (n=492) from the fall semester course completed a
   survey consisting of the VARK questionnaire, gender, academic year,
   career plans, and estimated hours spent per week in combined classroom
   and study time. Seventy-eight percent of students reported spending 15
   or fewer hours per week studying. Study time and overall course score
   correlated significantly for the class as a whole (r=0.111, P=0.013),
   which was mainly due to lecture (r=0.118, P=0.009) performance. No
   significant differences were found among students grouped by learning
   styles. When corrected for academic year, overall course scores (mean
   +/- SEM) for students planning to enter dentistry, medicine, optometry
   or pharmacy (79.89 +/- 0.88\%) were significantly higher than those of
   students planning to enter physical or occupational therapies (74.53 +/-
   1.15\%; P=0.033), as well as nurse/physician assistant programs (73.60
   +/- 1.3\%; P=0.040). Time spent studying was not significantly
   associated with either learning style or career choice. Our findings
   suggest that specific career goals and study time, not learning
   preferences, are associated with better performance among a diverse
   group of students in an undergraduate anatomy and physiology course.
   However, the extent to which prior academic preparation, cultural norms,
   and socioeconomic factors influenced these results requires further
   investigation. Anat Sci Educ 9: 121-131. (c) 2015 American Association

Title = {Conceptions of learning factors in postgraduate health sciences master
   students: a comparative study with non-health science students and

Abstract = {Background: The students' conceptions of learning in postgraduate health
   science master studies are poorly understood. The aim of this study was
   to compare the factors influencing conceptions of learning in health
   sciences and non-health sciences students enrolled in postgraduate
   master programs in order to obtain information that may be useful for
   students and for future postgraduate programs.
   Methods: A modified version of the Learning Inventory Conception
   Questionnaire (COLI) was used to compare students' conception learning
   factors in 131 students at the beginning of their postgraduate studies
   in health sciences, experimental sciences, arts and humanities and
   social sciences.
   Results: The present study demonstrates that a set of factors may
   influence conception of learning of health sciences postgraduate
   students, with learning as gaining information, remembering, using, and
   understanding information, awareness of duty and social commitment being
   the most relevant. For these students, learning as a personal change, a
   process not bound by time or place or even as acquisition of
   professional competences, are less relevant. According to our results,
   this profile is not affected by gender differences.
   Conclusions: Our results show that the overall conceptions of learning
   differ among students of health sciences and non-health sciences
   (experimental sciences, arts and humanities and social sciences) master
   postgraduate programs. These finding are potentially useful to foster
   the learning process of HS students, because if they are metacognitively
   aware of their own conception or learning, they will be much better
   equipped to self-regulate their learning behavior in a postgraduate
   master program in health sciences.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {Since the diversification of customer demands poses a great challenge
   for manufacturing enterprises and the scheduling problem of material
   handling affects the efficiency of assembly lines, this paper proposes a
   novel scheduling method, an improved static kitting strategy, to solve
   the scheduling problems of the material handling for automotive
   mixed-model assembly lines (MMALs) based on line-integrated
   supermarkets. Firstly, an integer programming mathematical model is
   established with the objective of minimizing the number of logistic
   workers. Then, an improved static kitting strategy is presented to solve
   the problem and a model based on graph theories is constructed to
   transform the scheduling problem to a mathematical one. Afterwards, a
   Kuhn-Munkres algorithm and an elite opposition-based learning adaptive
   dynamic differential evolution algorithm, named EOADDE algorithm, is
   developed to solve the scheduling problem. The elite opposition-based
   learning (EOL) and self-adaptive operators are applied to the proposed
   EOADDE algorithm to enhance the local search ability and the convergence
   speed. Finally, computational experiments of the proposed algorithm are
   carried out compared with benchmark algorithms, and the feasibility and
   effectiveness of proposed methods are verified by results.},

Abstract = {The exponential proliferation of Malware over the past decade has
   threatened system security across a plethora of Internet of Things (IoT)
   devices. Furthermore, the improvements in computer architectures to
   include speculative branching and out-of-order executions have
   engendered new opportunities for adversaries to carry out
   microarchitectural attacks in these devices. Both Malware and
   microarchitectural attacks are imperative threats to computing systems,
   as their behaviors range from stealing sensitive data to total system
   failure. With the cat-and-mouse game between Anti-Virus Software (AVS)
   and attackers, the frequent bolstering of AVS induces large
   computational overhead. Consequently, hardware performance counter
   (HPC)-based detection strategies augmented with machine learning (ML)
   classifiers have gained popularity as a low overhead solution in
   identifying these malicious threats. However, ML models are operated as
   black boxes, which results in decisions that are not human
   understandable. Clarity of the models' results facilitates the
   development of more robust systems. Existing explainable frameworks are
   only capable of determining each feature's impact on a prediction which
   does not provide meaningful interpretable outcomes for HPC-based
   intrusion detection. In this article, we address this issue by proposing
   an explainable HPC-based double regression (HPCDR) ML framework. Our
   proposed technique provides relevant transparency through isolation of
   the most malevolent transient window of an application, thereby allowing
   a user to efficiently locate the pernicious instructions within the
   program. We evaluated HPCDR on five microarchitectural attacks and two
   Malware. HPCDR was successfully able to identify the most malicious
   function manifested in each intrusive application.},

Title = {Machine-Learning Aided Optimal Customer Decisions for an Interactive
   Smart Grid},

Year = {2015},

Abstract = {In this paper, a hierarchical smart grid architecture is presented. The
   concept of smart home is extended in two aspects: 1) from traditional
   households with smart devices, such as advanced metering infrastructure,
   to intelligent entities with instantaneous and distributive
   decision-making capabilities; and 2) from individual households to
   general customer units of possibly large scales. We then develop a
   hidden mode Markov decision process (HM-MDP) model for a customer
   real-time decision-making problem. This real-time decision-making
   framework can effectively be integrated with demand response schemes,
   which are prediction based and therefore inevitably lead to real-time
   power-load mismatches. With the Baum-Welch algorithm adopted to learn
   the nonstationary dynamics of the environment, we propose a value
   iteration (VI)-based exact solution algorithm for the HM-MDP problem.
   Unlike conventional VI, the concept of parsimonious sets is used to
   enable a finite representation of the optimal value function. Instead of
   iterating the value function in each time step, we iterate the
   representational parsimonious sets by using the incremental pruning
   algorithm. Although this exact algorithm leads to optimal policies
   giving maximum rewards for the smart homes, its complexity suffers from
   the curse of dimensionality. To obtain a low-complexity real-time
   algorithm that allows adaptively incorporating new observations as the
   environment changes, we resort to Q-learning-based approximate dynamic
   programming. Q-learning offers more flexibility in practice because it
   does not require specific starting and ending points of the scheduling
   period. Performance analysis of both exact and approximate algorithms,
   as compared with the other possible alternative decision-making
   strategies, is presented in simulation results.},

   Wellness Program Staff},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 31},
Abstract = {Background: Staff play a critical role in promoting positive youth
   development in out-of-school-time programs, yet little is known about
   best-practices for preparing staff to work with youth and meet their
   needs. The present study seeks to understand the impact of a basic
   psychological needs training on the staff's ability to deliver
   needs-supportive instruction to youth during a summer wellness program.
   Methods: A quasi-experimental, qualitative design using interviews,
   observations, and journals was employed to compare the intervention
   staff (n = 9; M = 21.5) with a comparison group who did not receive the
   training (n = 8; M = 21.10). Results: Results indicated that the
   intervention enhanced the staff's understandings of basic psychological
   needs and empowered them to be more responsive to youth misbehavior,
   while educating youth about the importance of appropriate behavior.
   Conclusions: In order to prepare staff to meet the psychological needs
   of youth and protect themselves against exhaustion and burnout, future
   research should examine adequate dosage and content of staff training.},

Abstract = {Objectives: The dearth of data on the role of assessment in higher
   education formed the two purposes of this study: first to explore
   assessment strategies commonly used in nursing education by analyzing
   the curriculum documents of three baccalaureate nursing programs in
   Lebanon against Bloom's Taxonomy of learning, and second to unravel
   issues of instruction and assessment by categorizing data into teacher-
   and learner-centered strategies.
   Design: Content analysis research technique applied to analyze the
   curriculum documents of three baccalaureate nursing programs in Beirut,
   Lebanon.
   Method: After obtaining IRE approval and consent to access the
   curriculum documents of the programs, data were analyzed using the
   content analysis research technique. Data on assessments and instruction
   were categorized into student-centered and teacher-centered.
   Findings: Data revealed deficiency in employing learner-centered
   strategies in the assessment and instruction of the three programs.
   There was evidence that educators of the programs focus on teaching
   content and examining retention, thus supporting prior notions on
   teaching to the test and accusations in earnest on adherence to the
   traditional and behavioral curriculum perspectives. Such curricula leave
   little room for the development of higher order thinking in learners.
   Conclusions: Although assessments are believed to be indicators of
   program and teaching effectiveness, there is relatively alarming
   information on the incompatibility between current assessment practices
   and demands of the workplace. There is an urgent need for transforming
   educators' beliefs, knowledge, and skills on testing, since teaching to
   pass a test could impede knowledge transfer and deter the development of
   learners' higher order thinking skills. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The current impetus for increasing STEM in K-12 education calls for an
   examination of how preservice teachers are being prepared to teach STEM.
   This paper reports on a study that examined elementary preservice
   teachers' (n = 21) self-efficacy, understanding of science concepts, and
   computational thinking as they engaged with robotics in a science
   methods course. Data collection methods included pretests and posttests
   on science content, prequestionnaires and postquestionnaires for
   interest and self-efficacy, and four programming assignments.
   Statistical results showed that preservice teachers' interest and
   self-efficacy with robotics increased. There was a statistically
   significant difference between preknowledge and postknowledge scores,
   and preservice teachers did show gains in learning how to write
   algorithms and debug programs over repeated programming tasks. The
   findings suggest that the robotics activity was an effective
   instructional strategy to enhance interest in robotics, increase
   self-efficacy to teach with robotics, develop understandings of science
   concepts, and promote the development of computational thinking skills.
   Study findings contribute quantitative evidence to the STEM literature
   on how robotics develops preservice teachers' self-efficacy, science
   knowledge, and computational thinking skills in higher education science
   classroom contexts.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Coaching can provide learners with space to reflect on their
   performance while ensuring well-being and encouraging professional
   achievement and personal satisfaction outside of traditional mentorship
   and teaching models. We hypothesized that a proactive coaching program
   for general surgery interns coupled with individualized learning plans
   would help build foundational skills necessary for residency success and
   facilitate the incorporation of well-being practices into resident
   professional life. Here, we present the develop-ment, implementation,
   and outcomes of a novel well-being coaching program for surgical
   interns. DESIGN AND SETTING: A well-being coaching program was developed
   and implemented from July 2020 through June 2021 at a single
   university-based surgical residency program. To assess impact of the
   coaching program, we designed a mixed-methods study incorpo-rating
   end-of-program survey results as well as partici-pant narratives from
   commitment-to-act statements for thematic content. PARTICIPANTS: All 32
   general surgery interns partici-pated in aspects of the coaching
   program. RESULTS: The end-of-program survey was completed by 19/32
   (59\%) interns and commitment-to-act statements were completed by 22/32
   (69\%). The majority (89\%) of survey respondents ``agreed{''} or
   ``strongly agreed{''} that the longitudinal intern coaching program
   helped them reach goals they had set for themselves this academic year;
   15/19 (79\%) noted that the coaching experience was effective in
   promoting well-being practices in their life. Well-being and
   professional goals were identified as major themes in the
   end-of-the-year commitment-to-act statements. Statements specifically
   mentioned resources highlighted and skills taught in our coaching
   program such as mindfulness techniques, gratitude journals, and
   self-compassion strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Our study illustrates the
   effectiveness of a coaching pilot program on promoting well-being
   practices in a university-based general surgery intern-ship and can be a
   roadmap with proven efficacy and measurable outcomes. (J Surg Ed

Title = {Networking Matters: A Social Network Analysis of the Association of
   Program Directors of Internal Medicine},
Journal = {TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Pages = {415-422},
Abstract = {Theory: Networking has positive effects on career development; however,
   personal characteristics of group members such as gender or diversity
   may foster or hinder member connectedness. Social network analysis
   explores interrelationships between people in groups by measuring the
   strength of connection between all possible pairs in a given network.
   Social network analysis has rarely been used to examine network
   connections among members in an academic medical society. This study
   seeks to ascertain the strength of connection between program directors
   in the Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine (APDIM) and
   its Education Innovations Project subgroup and to examine possible
   associations between connectedness and characteristics of program
   directors and programs. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that connectedness
   will be measurable within a large academic medical society and will vary
   significantly for program directors with certain measurable
   characteristics (e.g., age, gender, rank, location, burnout levels,
   desire to resign). Method: APDIM program directors described levels of
   connectedness to one another on the 2012 APDIM survey. Using social
   network analysis, we ascertained program director connectedness by
   measuring out-degree centrality, in-degree centrality, and eigenvector
   centrality, all common measures of connectedness. Results: Higher
   centrality was associated with completion of the APDIM survey, being in
   a university-based program, Educational Innovations Project
   participation, and higher academic rank. Centrality did not vary by
   gender; international medical graduate status; previous chief resident
   status; program region; or levels of reported program director burnout,
   callousness, or desire to resign. Conclusions: In this social network
   analysis of program directors within a large academic medical society,
   we found that connectedness was related to higher academic rank and
   certain program characteristics but not to other program director
   characteristics like gender or international medical graduate status.
   Further research is needed to optimize our understanding of connection
   in organizations such as these and to determine which strategies promote
   valuable connections.},

Title = {The relationship of learned resourcefulness with self-leadership skills:
   A study with nurse and midwife students},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {107},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: It is important for the professionalism that students at the
   university use their coping skills to solve the problems that may arise
   before starting the profession, control their behaviours by directing
   themselves, and motivate themselves in case they face negative
   situations. Objectives: This study was carried out to determine the
   relationship between the selfleadership skills of students studying in
   nursing and midwifery departments and their learned resourcefulness
   skills. Design: The study a descriptive, correlational and
   cross-sectional pattern. Settings: The sample of the study consisted of
   380 students studying at the Nursing and Midwifery Department of the
   Faculty of Health Sciences of a foundation university in Istanbul.
   Methods: The research data were collected using the information form,
   the Revised Self-Leadership Questionnaire, and the Rosenbaum Learned
   Resourcefulness Scale. In the analysis of the data descriptive analysis,
   parametric or non-parametric comparative analyzes and correlational
   analyzes were used. Results: In the study; 84.5\% of the participants
   were female and whose mean age was 20.6-61.6\% of the participants were
   studying in the nursing department. The total score the students got
   from the Revised SelfLeadership Questionnaire was 131.87 +/- 23.49, and
   the total score that got from the Rosenbaum Learned Resourcefulness
   Scale was 120.81 +/- 16.77. The students studying in the third-grade
   (124.16 +/- 13.9) had higher self-control skills compared to the first
   (118.57 +/- 18.8) and the second-grade (119.2 +/- 16.7) students,
   that's, they frequently applied the coping strategies represented in the
   scale (p < 0.05). There was a positive linear relationship between two
   scale (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Within the framework of the research
   results, gender, grade and the department studied are related to the
   level of self-leadership. The level of learned resourcefulness was
   associated with classroom and stress training. Individuals'
   self-leadership levels showed a positive relationship with their learned
   resourcefulness level.},

Abstract = {Experiential learning is an effective educational tool across many
   academic disciplines, including career development. Nine different
   institutions bridged by the National Institutes of Health Broadening
   Experiences in Scientific Training Consortium compared their experiments
   in rethinking and expanding training of predoctoral graduate students
   and post-doctoral scholars in the biomedical sciences to include
   experiential learning opportunities. In this article, we provide an
   overview of the four types of experiential learning approaches our
   institutions offer and compare the learning objectives and evaluation
   strategies employed for each type. We also discuss key factors for
   shaping experiential learning activities on an institutional level. The
   framework we provide can help organizations determine which form of
   experiential learning for career training might best suit their
   institutions and goals and aid in the successful design and delivery of
   such training.},

Title = {The role of continuing medical education programs in promoting iranian
   nurses, competency toward non-communicable diseases, a qualitative
   content analysis study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},

Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Background Continuing medical education is essential for nurses to
   provide quality patient care and upgrade their professional skills and
   competence. The need for continuing medical education (CME) has become
   more apparent in the face of advances in medical science, the
   ever-changing healthcare system, and nurses' vital role in improving
   health care. It is, therefore, imperative to explore the nurses'
   experience of CME courses and the extent to which such programs are
   effective. Objective The present qualitative study aimed to explore and
   describe nurses' experiences of the effect of CE programs in promoting
   their competencies toward non-communicable diseases. Methods This
   qualitative content analysis study was conducted from December 2019 to
   April 2020 at various hospitals affiliated to Shiraz University of
   Medical Sciences (Shiraz, Iran) and based on the principles of
   conventional content analysis. The target population was nurses who
   actively worked in the chronic wards of these hospitals. The
   participants were selected using maximum variation sampling, including
   nine nursing managers, education and clinical supervisors, and staff
   nurses. Data were collected through individual, face-to-face,
   semi-structured interviews guided by an interview guide, and data
   collection continued until data saturation was achieved. Each interview
   took about 30-45 min. Follow up questions were used for clarification
   when needed. Data trustworthiness was assessed according to the criteria
   proposed by Guba and Lincoln. Results Analysis of the interview data
   resulted in 230 primary codes, based on 8 categories, and three themes
   were identified. The extracted themes were gaps in the planning of the
   CME program, problematic context, and training to improve professional
   skills and competency. The associated categories were gaps in the
   planning of the CME program, problematic context, and training to
   improve professional skills and competency. Conclusion Professional
   competence and performance of nurses can be improved through intrinsic
   motivation stimulation, planning, and implementation of training
   programs based on professional needs and effective assessment of the
   teaching/learning process.},

Title = {Challenges of Globalization and Successful Adaptation Strategies in
   Implementing a ``Scientific Writing and Authoring{''} Course in China},

Abstract = {This paper describes the adaptation of an upper-division undergraduate
   seminar course taught at the University of Missouri in Columbia (MU) to
   the Summer School Program of the University of Chinese Academy of
   Sciences in Beijing (UCAS). The course ``Scientific Writing in
   Chemistry{''} addresses an essential need for science students across
   the globe to receive experiential education in scientific writing. An
   assignment-based curriculum was developed to instruct students on best
   practices in writing a scientific paper and to educate students about
   the scientific publication process and peer review. The semester-long MU
   course that included three meetings per week and had low enrollment was
   adapted to 20 h UCAS block courses with much higher enrollments. The
   drastic differences in scale and mode of delivery posed numerous
   nontrivial challenges and required modifications of the teaching goals.
   Because of the short duration of the summer courses, the MU curriculum
   with its focus on ``working on assignments and working with rubrics{''}
   was adjusted to a curriculum which is based on ``working with posted
   samples of completed assignments and working with rubrics{''} at UCAS.
   Instruction on publication ethics was emphasized, and several
   adjustments were made to address cultural and language differences.
   Enrollment data and results of evaluations collected over five years
   (2011-2016) are presented to demonstrate the success of the adaptation.
   It is hoped that this paper will contribute to the wide and open
   dissemination of this ``Scientific Writing{''} curriculum and, more
   generally, that the example of our course adaptation might encourage
   outstanding experts from many science, technology, engineering, and
   mathematics (STEM) fields to contribute in a significant way to
   international education.},

   program in LabVIEW. Several tests were developed by dropping a
   projectile of a certain height and through an ultrasonic sensor HC-sr04
   you get the different heights of the bounce. Experimental results were
   used to determine the coefficient of restitution, the speed and the time
   for free fall of the projectile, which are compared with the results
   displayed on the virtual platform. Also this research established a
   proposal based on the development of prototypes teaching directed to

Abstract = {Problem: Meeting the needs of patients with life-limiting and terminal
   illness requires effectively trained physicians in all specialties to
   provide skillful and compassionate care. Despite mandates for
   end-of-life (EoL) care education, graduating medical students do not
   consistently feel prepared to provide this care. Intervention: We have
   developed a longitudinal, integrated, and developmental 4-year
   curriculum in EoL care. The curriculum's purpose is to teach basic
   competencies in EoL care. A variety of teaching strategies emphasize
   experiential, skill-building activities with special attention to
   student self-reflection. In addition, we have incorporated
   interprofessional learning and education on the spiritual and cultural
   aspects of care. We created blended learning strategies combining
   interactive online modules with live workshops that promote flexibility,
   adaptability, and interprofessional learning opportunities. Context: The
   curriculum was implemented and evaluated in the 4-year program of
   studies at Yale School of Medicine. Outcome: A mixed-method evaluation
   of the curriculum included reviews of student written reflections and
   questionnaires, graduating student surveys, and demonstration of
   4th-year students' competency in palliative care with an observed
   structured clinical examination (OSCE). These evaluations demonstrate
   significant improvements in students' self-reported preparedness in EoL
   care and perceptions of the adequacy in their instruction in EoL and
   palliative care, as well as competency in primary palliative care in a
   newly developed OSCE. Lessons Learned: A 4-year longitudinal integrated
   curriculum enhances students' skills and preparedness in important
   aspects of EoL care. As faculty resources, clinical sites, and
   curricular structure vary by institution, proven and adaptable
   educational strategies as described in this article may be useful to
   address the mandate to improve EoL care education. Teaching strategies
   and curricular components and design as just described can be adapted to
   other programs.},

Abstract = {Learning science is an emerging interdisciplinary field that offers
   educators key insights about what happens in the brain when learning
   occurs. In addition to explanations about the learning process, which
   includes memory and involves different parts of the brain, learning
   science offers effective strategies to inform the planning and
   implementation of activities and programs in continuing education and
   continuing professional development. This article provides a brief
   description of learning, including the three key steps of encoding,
   consolidation and retrieval. The article also introduces four major
   learning-science strategies, known as distributed learning, retrieval
   practice, interleaving, and elaboration, which share the importance of
   considerable practice. Finally, the article describes how learning
   science aligns with the general findings from the most recent synthesis
   of systematic reviews about the effectiveness of continuing medical
   education.},

Title = {A model of influences on the clinical learning environment: the case for
   change at one US medical school},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {MAR 23},
Abstract = {Background: The learning environment within a school of medicine
   influences medical students' values and their professional development.
   Despite national requirements to monitor the learning environment,
   mistreatment of medical students persists.
   Methods: We designed a program called WE SMILE: We can Eradicate Student
   Mistreatment In the Learning Environment with a vision to enhance
   trainee and faculty awareness and ultimately eliminate medical student
   mistreatment. We provide a description of our program and early
   outcomes.
   Results: The program has enhanced student awareness of what constitutes
   mistreatment and how to report it. Faculty members are also aware of the
   formal processes and procedures for review of such incidents. Our
   proposed model of influences on the learning environment and the
   clinical workforce informs the quality of trainee education and safety
   of patient care. Institutional leadership and culture play a prominent
   role in this model. Our integrated institutional response to learning
   environment concerns is offered as a strategy to improve policy
   awareness, reporting and management of student mistreatment concerns.
   Conclusions: Our WE SMILE program was developed to enhance education and
   awareness of what constitutes mistreatment and to provide multiple
   pathways for student reporting, with clear responsibilities for review,
   adjudication and enforcement. The program is demonstrating several signs
   of early success and is offered as a strategy for other schools to adopt
   or adapt. We have recognized a delicate balance between preserving
   student anonymity and informing them of specific actions taken.
   Providing students and other stakeholders with clear evidence of
   institutional response and accountability remains a key challenge.
   Multiple methods of reporting have been advantageous in eliciting
   information on learning environment infringements. These routes and
   types of reporting have enhanced our understanding of student
   perceptions and the specific contexts in which mistreatment occurs,
   allowing for targeted interventions. A common platform across the
   healthcare professions to report and review concerns has afforded us
   opportunities to deal with interprofessional issues in a respectful and
   trustworthy manner. We offer a model of learning environment influences
   with leadership and institutional culture at the helm, as a way to frame
   a comprehensive perspective on this challenging and complex concern.},

Abstract = {Polymers are present in most organic materials in the field of cultural
   heritage science and art conservation. This makes the study of polymer
   chemistry necessary in art conservation graduate training programs.
   Given each program approaches this important topic in different ways,
   the present paper describes areas of common ground and problems we, as
   faculty in two of the programs in North America, have found, and how we
   have addressed them: from stressing the importance of polymer science as
   part of a holistic educational model to emerging art conservators, to
   addressing the characterization and degradation of polymers in cultural
   heritage. While they are seemingly different, both approaches
   successfully accomplish our overall goal: instill scientific curiosity
   and problem solving using the extremely ubiquitous class of materials we
   know as polymers. Consequently, our strategies and the practical
   exercises we are describing can be easily applied to other areas where
   polymers are present.},

Title = {Using Artifacts and Qualitative Methodology to Explore Pharmacy
   Students' Learning Practices},

Volume = {84},

Abstract = {Objective. To explore the use of artifacts and material objects in
   accessing what learning means to pharmacy students, what their learning
   practices are, and their assumptions about what it means to master the
   pharmacy curriculum.
   Methods. Data collection was qualitative and took the form of individual
   semi-structured interviews with students in a Master of Pharmacy
   program. Participants were asked to select three artifacts (a
   photograph, an object, a song, a picture, or something else) that
   represented what learning as a pharmacy student meant to them and bring
   them to the interview. The interviews were conducted using both the
   abstracts and a semi-structured interview plan constructed as a mind
   map. Flexibility was applied to changing the sequence of themes, and
   additional probing questions were asked. Data were analyzed thematically
   using mind mapping and, subsequently, theoretical constructs were
   applied to make sense of the analysis.
   Results. Nineteen interviews were conducted. Findings were grouped into
   five distinct themes: study practices or strategies adopted, rituals
   associated with learning and studying, pharmacy knowledge, motivation
   for learning, and ways of learning. Each of these identified themes was
   summarized and illustrations from the data given. The affective
   dimensions of learning were a strong emergent theme throughout the data.
   Conclusion. The use of artifacts in the research process afforded
   in-depth insight into the specific study practices adopted by a group of
   pharmacy students. Qualitative methods can be useful in surfacing
   students' learning practices and difficulties faced in their negotiation
   of the pharmacy curriculum.},

Title = {Teacher Perceptions of Multilevel Policies and the Influence on
   Nutrition Education in North Carolina Head Start Preschools},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NUTRITION EDUCATION AND BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {49},
Number = {5},
Pages = {387+},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objective: To develop a theory that explains the process of how
   teachers' perception of multilevel policies may influence nutrition
   education (NE) teaching strategies in Head Start preschools.
   Design: Semistructured telephone interviews.
   Setting: North Carolina Head Start preschools.
   Participants: Thirty-two Head Start teachers. Phenomenon of Interest:
   All interviews were transcribed verbatim. Following a grounded theory
   approach, authors coded interview data for emergent themes.
   Analysis: Two primary themes emerged during analysis, including
   teachers' policy perceptions and teacher-perceived influence of policy
   on NE.
   Results: A theoretical model was developed to explain how teachers'
   perceptions of policies influenced NE (eg, teaching strategies) in the
   classroom. Teachers discussed multiple policy areas governing their
   classrooms and limiting their ability to provide meaningful and
   consistent NE. How teachers perceived the level of regulation in the
   classroom (ie, high or low) influenced the frequency with which they
   used specific teaching strategies.
   Conclusion and Implications: Despite federal policies supporting the
   provision of NE, teachers face competing priorities in the classroom
   (eg, school readiness vs NE) and policies may conflict with standardized
   NE curricula. To understand how Head Start centers develop local
   policies, additional research should investigate how administrators
   interpret federal and state policies.},

Title = {The effects of multiple-pedagogical agents on learners' academic
   success, motivation, and cognitive load},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {74-100},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In computer-assisted instruction, primary causes for the main problems
   are student's feeling lonely and lack of social learning environment.
   Pedagogical agents, which could enable students to use software, have
   been developed and integrated into instructional software to remove the
   obstacles mentioned. The main purpose of the study is to compare the
   effects of a fixed pedagogical agent and multi pedagogical agents left
   to students' choice on dependent variables. Additionally, it has also
   been examined if computer assisted instruction software without
   pedagogical agent has any effects on dependent variables. The study
   seeks to investigate both learners' agent preferences and the effects of
   pedagogical agents on learners' academic success, motivation and
   cognitive load. For the purpose of the study, four groups were formed.
   The first group used educational software via fixed agent, the second
   group used educational software with the option to choose among several
   agents whereas the third group used educational software without agent
   and the fourth group received the same education through traditional
   way. The academic success refers to MS Excel program literacy. The
   findings revealed no statistically significant difference between fixed
   and multi pedagogical agents in terms of dependent variables. However,
   the designs with agents were found to have positive effects on learners'
   motivation, academic success and cognitive load. The results also
   indicated that pedagogical agents should be used in all
   computer-assisted instruction software. Another finding of the study is
   that the students in younger age groups tend to prefer the same gender
   agent as theirs. Furthermore, feedback from participants showed that
   users of multi pedagogical agents would like to conceive their own
   pedagogical agents. Accordingly, it is suggested that learners should be
   provided with programs that can be personalized depending on learners'
   needs and preferences. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper considers the optimization problem of joint admission control
   and routing for the video streaming service in wired software-defined
   networking (SDN). With the aid of the network operating system, SDN is
   able to support the dynamic nature of future network functions and
   intelligent applications. Against this changing network landscape, we
   rely on Flow Visor-based virtualization in the context of OpenFlow-based
   wired SDN to design an open optimization architecture for the joint
   admission control and routing, which supports flexible and agile
   deployment of advanced joint admission control and routing strategies.
   Following this architecture, we interpret the joint admission control
   and routing problem into the Markov decision process for maximizing the
   overall `` revenue.{''} In order to solve the issue of the curses of
   dimensionality, we invoke the function approximation technique in the
   context of approximate dynamic programming to conceive an online
   learning framework. By applying kernel-based autonomous feature
   extraction into the function approximation, we develop an approximate
   dynamic programming-based joint admission control and routing for video
   streaming service, which is apt to be implemented in the proposed open
   architecture. An emulation platform based on Flow Visor, POX, and
   Mininet is constructed for demonstrating the success of the proposed
   solution. The experimental results are presented to show the performance
   improvement of the proposed scheme by comparing it with the Q-learning
   algorithm and open shortest path first-based benchmark scheme.},

Title = {Marc: Multi-Granular Representation Learning for Networks Based on the
   3-Clique},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Abstract = {Network embedding is of paramount importance in many real applications,
   such as node classification, network visualization, and link prediction.
   Existing methods can effectively encode different structural properties
   into representations. Most of them are single-granular representation
   learning methods that do not enable the network to be easily analyzed at
   various scales. There are many kinds of hierarchical structures in
   reality. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm multi-granular
   representation learning for networks based on the 3-clique named Marc.
   It makes the representations of the current network be formed by both
   considering the structure of this granular network and inheriting the
   coarser network representation results. Firstly, we propose the 3-clique
   coarsening strategy. A 3-clique is coarsened to be a supernode in the
   coarser network. These coarsened networks with different granularities,
   preserve the original network's main structure. Secondly, we use the
   single-granular optimization objective function to obtain the nodes'
   representations of each granular network. Finally, the refinement model
   learns the nodes' representations, starting from the coarsest network.
   The learned representations of supernodes serve as good initializations
   for embedding the corresponding coarsened nodes from the finer network.
   This process is repeated until we obtain an embedding for each node in
   the original network which preserves the relationship among
   multi-granular networks. The experimental results on five public
   datasets, Wiki, BlogCatalog, Cora, CiteSeer, and DBLP, demonstrate that
   Marc has a better Macro F-1 value for classification tasks than the
   baseline methods.},

Abstract = {BackgroundA report from the American Society for Engineering Education
   (Jamieson \& Lohmann, 2012) identified career-long professional
   development for faculty, teacher training in graduate programs,
   departmental climates that value and support educational innovation, and
   reward systems that recognize achievements in educational innovation as
   mechanisms to improve undergraduate engineering education. These factors
   have long been assumed to influence faculty members' choices to engage
   in educational improvements, but their relationships with teaching
   practices rarely have been studied.
   PurposeWe examined the relationships among professional development,
   departmental contexts, and engineering faculty members' use of
   student-centered teaching practices.
   Design/MethodThis study drew on a nationally representative survey
   dataset of 906 engineering faculty members from 31 four-year
   institutions. We used multiple regression analyses to investigate
   whether graduate training, professional development, and institutional
   factors (e.g., reward systems) relate to engineering faculty members'
   use of student-centered teaching practices, such as active learning and
   frequent and detailed feedback to students.
   ResultsProfessional development activities and, to a lesser extent,
   graduate training in teaching positively related to the use of
   student-centered teaching practices. We provide some of the first
   evidence that graduate training in teaching is linked to the use of
   student-centered teaching practices. Only modest relationships were
   observed between departmental environments and teaching practices.
   ConclusionEngineering departments seeking to increase the use of
   student-centered teaching practices should consider supporting faculty
   engagement in on- and off-campus professional development activities.
   Supporting these activities may be more effective than emphasizing
   research on engineering education and curriculum enhancement in reward
   decisions.},

Abstract = {With introduction of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network
   Functions Virtualization (NFV) technologies, mobile network operators
   are able to provide on-demand Service Function Chaining (SFC) to meet
   various needs from users. However, it is challenging to map multiple
   SFCs to substrate networks efficiently, particularly in a number of key
   scenarios of forthcoming 5G, where user requests have different
   priorities and various resource demands. To this end, we first formulate
   the mapping of multiple SFCs with priorities as a multi-step Linear
   Integer Programming (ILP) problem, of which the mapping strategy (i.e.,
   the objective function) in each step is configurable to improve overall
   CPU and bandwidth resource utilization rates. Secondly, to solve the
   strategy selection problem in each step and alleviate the complexity of
   ILP, we propose an adaptive deep Q-learning based SFC mapping approach
   (ADAP), where an agent is learned to make decisions from two
   low-complexity heuristic SFC mapping algorithms. Finally, we conduct
   extensive simulations using multiple SFC requests with randomly
   generated CPU and bandwidth demands in a real-world substrate network
   topology. Related results demonstrate that compared with a single
   strategy or random selections of strategies under the ILP-based approach
   or the proposed heuristic algorithms, our ADAP approach can improve
   whole-system resource efficiency by scheduling this two simply designed
   heuristic algorithms properly after limited training episodes.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a Game-Based
   Auxiliary Training System (GBATS) in special education for improving
   visual perceptual dysfunction in children with developmental
   disabilities. The GBATS application program was designed in the first
   stage of the study. Sixty participants with visual perceptual
   dysfunction were then randomly assigned to either an experimental group
   or a control group (n = 30 each) to evaluate the effectiveness of the
   GBATS. The experimental group received the GBATS while the control group
   received the Conventional Visual Perceptual Training Program (CVPTP).
   Both the GBATS and CVPTP were administered in two 30-min sessions per
   week for 8 weeks. The post-intervention outcome measures were the Test
   of Visual Perceptual Skill, Third Edition, the Vineland Adaptive
   Behavior Scale, and the School Function Assessment. At
   post-intervention, the GBATS group significantly outperformed the CVPTP
   group in all three measures. Specifically, children in the GBATS group
   showed significantly larger improvements in demonstrated benefit in
   improving visual perceptual function. The GBATS group also showed
   significantly larger improvements in adaptive behaviors and school
   functions. The present study shows that the GBATS can be used as a
   training program adjuvant to other rehabilitative interventions that
   have proven effective for treating visual perceptual dysfunction in
   children.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to assess the current status of
   physiology education in US Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) programs. A
   survey instrument was developed and distributed through SurveyMonkey to
   American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) Biological Sciences
   section members of 132 PharmD programs. Survey items focused on
   soliciting qualitative and quantitative information on the delivery of
   physiology curricular contents and faculty perceptions of physiology
   education. A total of 114 programs responded to the survey, resulting in
   a response rate of 86\%. Out of 114 schools/colleges, 61 programs (54\%)
   offered standalone physiology courses, and 53 programs (46\%) offered
   physiology integrated with other courses. When integrated, the average
   contact hours for physiology contents were significantly reduced
   compared with standalone courses (30 vs. 84 h, P < 0.0001). Survey
   respondents identified diverse strategies in the delivery and assessment
   of physiology contents. Eighty percent of the responding faculty (n =
   204) agree/strongly agree that physiology is underemphasized in PharmD
   curriculum. Moreover, 67\% of the respondents agree/strongly agree that
   physiology should be taught as a standalone foundational course. A wide
   variation in the depth and breadth of physiology course offerings in US
   PharmD programs remains. The reduction of physiology contents is evident
   when physiology is taught as a component of integrated courses. Given
   current trends that favor integrated curricula, these data suggest that
   additional collaboration among basic and clinical science faculty is
   required to ensure that physiology contents are balanced and not
   underemphasized in a PharmD curriculum.},

Abstract = {Arguably, constructive alignment has been the major challenge for
   assessment in the context of problem-based learning (PBL). PBL focuses
   on promoting abilities such as clinical reasoning, team skills and
   metacognition. PBL also aims to foster self-directed learning and deep
   learning as opposed to rote learning. This has incentivized researchers
   in assessment to find possible solutions. Originally, these solutions
   were sought in developing the right instruments to measure these
   PBL-related skills. The search for these instruments has been
   accelerated by the emergence of competency-based education. With
   competency-based education assessment moved away from purely
   standardized testing, relying more heavily on professional judgment of
   complex skills. Valuable lessons have been learned that are directly
   relevant for assessment in PBL. Later, solutions were sought in the
   development of new assessment strategies, initially again with
   individual instruments such as progress testing, but later through a
   more holistic approach to the assessment program as a whole.
   Programmatic assessment is such an integral approach to assessment. It
   focuses on optimizing learning through assessment, while at the same
   gathering rich information that can be used for rigorous decision-making
   about learner progression. Programmatic assessment comes very close to
   achieving the desired constructive alignment with PBL, but its wide
   adoption-just like PBL-will take many years ahead of us.},

Title = {ALTRA: Cross-Project Software Defect Prediction via Active Learning and
   Tradaboost},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {30037-30049},
Abstract = {Cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) methods can be used when the
   target project is a new project or lacks enough labeled program modules.
   In these new target projects, we can easily extract and then measure
   these modules with software measurement tools. However, labeling these
   program modules is time-consuming, error-prone and requires professional
   domain knowledge. Moreover, directly using labeled modules in the other
   projects (i.e., the source projects) can not achieve satisfactory
   performance due to the large data distribution difference in most cases.
   In this article, to our best knowledge, we are the first to propose a
   novel method ALTRA, which can utilize both active learning and
   TrAdaBoost to alleviate this issue. In particular, we firstly use Burak
   filter to select similar labeled modules from the source project after
   analyzing the unlabeled modules in the target project. Then we use
   active learning to choose representative unlabeled modules from the
   target project and ask experts to label the type (i.e., defective or
   non-defective) of these modules. Later, we use TrAdaBoost to determine
   the weights of labeled modules in the source project and the target
   project, and then construct the model via weighted support vector
   machine. After selecting a small number of modules (i.e., only 5 \&
   x0025; modules) in the target project, we terminate the method ALTRA and
   return the final constructed model. To show the effectiveness of our
   proposed method ALTRA, we choose 10 large-scale open-source projects
   from different application domains. In terms of both F1 and AUC
   performance indicators, we find ALTRA can perform significantly better
   than seven state-of-the-art CPDP baselines. Moreover, we also show that
   the usage of Burak filter, the uncertainty active learning strategy, the
   class imbalanced learning method and TrAdaBoost are competitive in our
   proposed method ALTRA.},

Title = {H-infinity Control for Discrete-Time Multi-Player Systems via Off-Policy
   Q-Learning},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {28831-28846},
Abstract = {This paper presents a novel off-policy game Q-learning algorithm to
   solve control problem for discrete-time linear multi-player systems with
   completely unknown system dynamics. The primary contribution of this
   paper lies in that the Q-learning strategy employed in the proposed
   algorithm is implemented in an off-policy policy iteration approach
   other than on-policy learning, since the off-policy learning has some
   well-known advantages over the on-policy learning. All of players
   struggle together to minimize their common performance index meanwhile
   defeating the disturbance that tries to maximize the specific
   performance index, and finally they reach the Nash equilibrium of game
   resulting in satisfying disturbance attenuation condition. For finding
   the solution of the Nash equilibrium, control problem is first
   transformed into an optimal control problem. Then an off-policy
   Q-learning algorithm is put forward in the typical adaptive dynamic
   programming (ADP) and game architecture, such that control policies of
   all players can be learned using only measured data. More importantly,
   the rigorous proof of no bias of solution to the Nash equilibrium by
   using the proposed off-policy game Q-learning algorithm is presented.
   Comparative simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness
   and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.},

Abstract = {Background Identifying effective methods for safeguarding the efficient
   functioning of the healthcare system contributes significantly towards
   establishing a successful healthcare organization. Consequently, quality
   management programs are currently being implemented in healthcare as a
   vital strategy for patient care. Quality management encompasses
   protocols and guidelines in decision-making and in the evaluation of
   processes and treatment flowcharts, data analysis and health indicators,
   and addresses improvement in the interaction between different health
   professionals. Qualifying health professionals to perform quality
   management has represented a barrier to implementing a well-structured
   management system. Indeed, the pathway to qualifying health managers is
   often poorly outlined, with clear gaps in the definition of their
   competencies, training and career plans. Therefore, studies and
   education-related actions aimed at qualifying health professionals in
   management are vital if health services of excellence are to be
   established. The present study aimed to plan, develop, implement and
   evaluate a management specialization course in oncology using blended
   learning. Methods Following approval by the institution's internal
   review board, the study was conducted at the Instituto de Medicina
   Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira (IMIP). The Analysis, Design,
   Development, Implementation and Evaluation (ADDIE) model was used to
   plan, develop, implement and evaluate the course. Data were collected as
   the course participants who had concluded all the modules evaluated the
   program. Results A management course in oncology, consisting of ten
   sequential modules, was developed and implemented between March 2018 and
   February 2019. The course consisted of monthly face-to-face encounters,
   each with 12 h of activities, and distance education using a virtual
   learning environment. Each module was presented by a specialist on the
   subject in question. After the end-of-course conclusion work had already
   been handed in and evaluated by the tutors, the participants completed a
   form to assess the course using Kirkpatrick's training evaluation model.
   Conclusions A management course in oncology was developed using the
   ADDIE model. A high degree of satisfaction was found among the
   participants regarding improvements in their management skills and their
   professional behavior. The expectation is that this initiative will
   ultimately improve healthcare and reduce costs, as well as encourage
   further innovative educational actions for health professionals.},

Title = {Quantum Particle Swarm With Teamwork Evolutionary Strategy for
   Multi-Objective Optimization on Electro-Optical Platform},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {41205-41219},
Abstract = {This paper deals with multi-objective optimization design of the
   airborne electro-optical platform to reduce its mechanical resonance,
   improve its stability and reduce its mass. The traditional group
   intelligent algorithm could easily fall into a local optimum. This
   greatly affects its search accuracy; the multi-objective optimization of
   the optoelectronic platform cannot meet the design requirements with
   traditional algorithms. This paper proposes a teamwork evolutionary
   strategy quantum particle swarm optimization (TEQPSO) algorithm for
   balancing global and local search. This algorithm is based on a novel
   learning strategy consisting of cross-sequential quadratic programming
   and Gaussian chaotic mutation operators. The former performs the local
   search on the sample and the interlaced operation on the parent
   individual while the descendants of the latter generated by Gaussian
   chaotic mutation may produce new regions in the search space. The
   experiments performed on multimodal test and composite functions with or
   without coordinate rotation demonstrated that the population information
   could be utilized by the TEQPSO algorithm more effectively compared with
   the twelve QSOs and PSOs variants. This improves the algorithm
   performance, significantly. Finally, the TEQPSO algorithm is employed
   for multi-objective optimization design of the airborne electro-optical
   platform. This leads to significant vibration response and mass
   reduction as well as stiffness characteristics improvement. Finally,
   higher search accuracy and superior performance are obtained with the
   TEQPSO algorithm compared with the QPSO algorithm.},

Title = {Engaging Pharmacy Students in Research Through Near-Peer Training},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {81},
Number = {9},
Abstract = {Objective. To describe the implementation of a near-peer training model
   within a student research program.
   Methods. A near-peer training model was implemented in a pharmacy
   student research program to promote development of effective teaching
   skills and research competencies. Under the supervision of a research
   mentor, senior learners precepted junior learners in various aspects of
   translational research. A three-step teaching process was employed
   throughout the experience in which junior learners performed an assigned
   task, senior learners provided guidance and mentorship, and research
   mentors provided feedback for improvement.
   Results. A total of 43 pharmacy trainees have participated in the
   student research program; each year of involvement now averages 15 to 18
   students. The program has been responsible for almost 100 poster
   presentations at national meetings and more than 20 manuscripts in
   peer-reviewed journals. Funding through intramural grants and
   scholarships to compensate for conference expenses and other functions
   has also been awarded.
   Conclusion. Near-peer teaching supports a tiered-research model under
   the supervision of a research mentor. For health care systems and
   colleges of pharmacy with established research programs or those seeking
   to implement new programs, near-peer teaching appears to be a promising
   strategy to promote the development of research competencies in
   pharmacist trainees.},

Title = {Chapter 3: Recruitment and Retention in PETE: Foundations in
   Occupational Socialization Theory},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Chapter 2 overviewed the teacher pipeline and documented some of the
   challenges faced by the physical education profession in relation to
   teacher education recruitment and retention. Given declining program
   enrollments and the elimination of some once-prominent programs, a
   theory of action is recommended for understanding how the field can
   better recruit and retain diverse, highly qualified preservice teachers.
   In this chapter, we argue that occupational socialization theory
   presents one such theory of action. We begin with an overview of the
   theory in a general sense and then discuss possible implications for
   preservice teacher recruitment and retention. Recommended recruitment
   efforts focus on leveraging both physical education teacher education
   faculty members and in-service teachers as agents of recruitment;
   retention strategies relate to developing field-based teacher education
   programs that adopt a constructivist approach to teaching and learning.
   We conclude by describing how occupational socialization theory relates
   to guide research presented within this monograph.},

Abstract = {Testing can influence student learning outcomes by influencing their
   approach to study and to learning. It is important to understand the
   influence of testing on students' learning outcomes to optimize
   instruction. We examine the role that testing played in a science
   course, to examine the effect of testing on retention and performance on
   a standardized final exam. This study compared two sections-experimental
   condition with testing (N = 35) and comparison condition with homework
   (N = 39)-of an Electricity and Magnetism course in a pre-university
   program to explore the role of the testing effect, that is, whether
   taking a test aids subsequent learning and retention. Results indicated
   that the students in the experimental group had a higher final exam
   average and greatest achievement gains. Our findings corroborate
   previous research and suggest that the traditional homework-based
   instructional strategy is a less effective approach for science learning
   or later retention compared to an instructional approach incorporating
   regular testing. Implications of these findings and the importance of
   testing in science instruction are also discussed.},

Abstract = {In international surveys, Brazilian students have been consistently
   ranking low in science. Continuing education for secondary school
   teachers is certainly a way to change this situation. To update teachers
   and provide teaching and learning experiences for graduate students, our
   department organized a ``Winter Course in Physiology{''} where
   schoolteachers had the opportunity to attend lectures that were offered
   by graduate students and participate in discussions on teaching and
   learning strategies and their applicability, considering different
   schools and student age groups. This work evaluated the ways in which
   the Winter Course in Physiology improves continuing education for
   secondary school teachers. Graduate students prepared, presented, and
   discussed with the audience the concepts, content, and topics of the
   program, which were previously presented to the organizing committee and
   a supervising professor. Potential participants were recruited based on
   their curriculum vitae and a letter of intent. During the course, they
   completed a questionnaire that graded different aspects of course
   organization and lectures. The results indicated that the Winter Course
   was positively evaluated. Most topics received a grade of >= 4.0,
   considering a range of 1.0 (low) to 5.0 (high). In a followup, both the
   participants and instructors reported positive impacts on their overall
   knowledge in physiology. Schoolteachers reported improvements in the
   performance and participation of their students. In conclusion, the
   results suggested that the Winter Course is a good way to promote
   continuing education for schoolteachers and promote university outreach.
   It also provided an important experience for graduate students to
   develop teaching skills.},

Title = {A novel reinforcement learning-based hyper-heuristic for heterogeneous
   vehicle routing problem},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {156},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study investigates a practical heterogeneous vehicle routing
   problem that involves routing a predefined fleet with different vehicle
   capacities to serve a series of customers to minimize the maximum
   routing time of vehicles. The comprehensive utilization of different
   types of vehicles brings great challenges for problem modeling and
   solving. In this study, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model
   is formulated to obtain optimal solutions for small-scale problems. To
   further improve the quality of solutions for large-scale problems, this
   study develops a reinforcement learning-based hyper-heuristic, which
   introduces several meta-heuristics with different characteristics as
   low-level heuristics and policy-based reinforcement learning as a
   high-level selection strategy. Moreover, deep learning is used to
   extract hidden patterns within the collected data to combine the
   advantages of low-level heuristics better. Numerical experiments have
   been conducted and results indicate that the proposed algorithm exceeds
   the MILP solution on large-scale problems and outperforms the existing
   meta-heuristic algorithms.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Describe the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on general
   surgery residency training nationwide.
   DESIGN: A 31-question electronic survey was distributed to general
   surgery program directors. Qualitative data underwent iterative coding
   analysis. Quantitative data were evaluated with summary statistics and
   bivariate analyses.
   PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-four residency programs (33.6\% response rate) with
   representation across US geographic regions, program affiliations, and
   sizes.
   RESULTS: Widespread changes were observed in the surgical training
   environment. One hundred percent of programs reduced the number of
   residents on rounds and 95.2\% reduced the size of their in-hospital
   resident workforce; on average, daytime staffing decreased by nearly
   half. With telehealth clinics (90.5\%) and remote inpatient consults
   (26.2\%), both clinical care and resident didactics (86.9\%) were
   increasingly virtual, with similar impact across all program
   demographics. Conversely, availability of some wellness initiatives was
   significantly higher among university programs than independent
   programs, including childcare (51.2\% vs 6.7\%), housing (41.9\% vs
   13.3\%), and virtual mental health services (83.7\% vs 53.3\%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Changes in clinical care delivery dramatically reduced in
   face-to-face learning opportunities for surgical trainees during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. While this effect had equal impact across all program
   types, sizes, and geographies, the same cannot be said for wellness
   initiatives. Though all programs initiated some strategies to protect
   resident health, the disparity between university programs and
   independent programs may be cause for action. (C) 2020 Association of

Abstract = {Objective This study sought to increase understanding of preoperative
   preparatory strategies utilised by senior surgical residents and
   identify how social and material forces come together to shape practice.
   Summary/Background Data Preoperative preparation can play a powerful
   role in operative learning. Residents rarely receive guidance, feedback,
   or explicit expectations on how to prepare for the OR. Understanding
   current practice and how to support preoperative preparation represents
   an important gap in our efforts to improve surgical training.
   Methods Constructivist grounded theory with sensitizing concepts from
   sociomateriality guided data collection and analysis. Fifteen senior
   surgical residents from a range of surgical disciplines were
   purposefully sampled and participated in an in-depth individual
   interview. Two return-of-finding focus groups followed with seven
   residents. Rigor was enhanced through constant comparison, theoretical
   sampling, pursuit of discrepant data, and investigator triangulation.
   Results Residents utilised a range of strategies addressing four areas
   of focus: develop technical skills, improve procedural knowledge,
   enhance patient-specificity, and know surgical preferences. However,
   residents also described receiving limited guidance on what it means to
   `be prepared' and experience significant challenges in achieving
   preparedness. A mix of social and material things that enabled or
   constrained preparatory efforts influenced individual strategies. These
   included rotation structure, relationships, the OR list, and time.
   Conclusions Our findings offer possible solutions by elaborating on
   preparatory variability and considerations for residents, faculty, and
   programs to improve practice. As a first step, we suggest programs begin
   to engage in explicit dialogue and reflection with their residents,
   faculty, and residency program committees.},

Abstract = {Modern optimizing compilers tend to be conservative and often fail to
   vectorize programs that would have benefited from it. In this paper, we
   propose a way to predict the relevant command-line options of the
   compiler so that it chooses the most profitable vectorization strategy.
   Machine learning has proven to be a relevant approach for this matter:
   fed with features that describe the software to the compiler, a machine
   learning device is trained to predict an appropriate optimization
   strategy. The related work relies on the control and data flow graphs as
   software features. In this article, we consider tensor contraction
   programs, useful in various scientific simulations, especially
   chemistry. Depending on how they access the memory, different tensor
   contraction kernels may yield very different performance figures.
   However, they exhibit identical control and data flow graphs, making
   them completely out of reach of the related work. In this paper, we
   propose an original set of software features that capture the important
   properties of the tensor contraction kernels. Considering the Intel
   Merom processor architecture with the Intel Compiler, we model the
   problem as a classification problem and we solve it using a support
   vector machine. Our technique predicts the best suited vectorization
   options of the compiler with a cross-validation accuracy of 93.4\%,
   leading to up to a 3-times speedup compared to the default behavior of
   the Intel Compiler. This article ends with an original qualitative
   discussion on the performance of software metrics by means of
   visualization. All our measurements are made available for the sake of
   reproducibility.},

Abstract = {Background: Sustaining and strengthening nurses `contributions to public
   and population health in the 21st century depends in part on nursing
   education. Clearly articulated entry-to-practice competencies will
   contribute to the capacity of undergraduate nursing education programs
   to prepare graduates to promote local, national and global population
   health.
   Objectives: The Canadian Association of Schools of Nursing created the
   Public Health Task Force to develop consensus on core, national
   entry-to-practice competencies in public health nursing for
   undergraduate nursing students and to support these competencies with
   corresponding online teaching strategies.
   Design: Delphi approach.
   Participants: Nurses with public health experience in education and
   practice, and representatives from other public health professional
   organizations across Canada.
   Method: The three-phased competency development included: 1) an
   environmental scan; 2) an iterative process to draft competencies; and
   3) a modified Delphi process to confirm the final competency framework
   using face to face consultations and a survey. The knowledge translation
   strategy involved soliciting submissions of teaching strategies for
   peer-review and subsequent inclusion in an interactive online resource.
   Results: 242 public health educators and practitioners participated in
   the consensus consultation. The final document outlined five competency
   statements with 19 accompanying indicators. A total of 123 teaching
   strategies were submitted for the online resource, of which 50 were
   accepted as exemplary teaching strategies.
   Conclusion: This competency development process can provide guidance for
   the development of competencies in other countries, thus strengthening
   public health nursing education globally. The decision to intentionally
   level the competencies to entry-to-practice, as opposed to an advanced
   level, enhanced their application to undergraduate nursing education.
   The development of the additional inventory of teaching strategies
   created a sustainable innovative resource for public health nursing
   educators and practitioners world-wide to support the adoption of
   entry-to-practice public health nursing competencies.},

Abstract = {Background: Mathematical and calculation skills are widely acknowledged
   as being key nursing competences if patients are to receive care that is
   both effective and safe. Indeed, weaknesses in mathematical competence
   may lead to the administration of miscalculated drug doses, which in
   turn may harm or endanger patients' lives. However, little attention has
   been given to identifying appropriate teaching and learning strategies
   that will effectively facilitate the development of these skills in
   nurses. One such approach may be simulation.
   Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of a Clinical Skills Workshop
   on drug administration that focused on improving the drug-dosage
   calculation skills of second-year nursing students, with a view to
   promoting safety in drugs administration.
   Design: A descriptive pre-post test design.
   Settings: Educational. Simulation center.
   Participants: The sample population included 77 nursing students from a
   Northern Italian University who attended a 30-hour Clinical Skills
   Workshop over a period of two weeks.
   Methods: The workshop covered integrated teaching strategies and
   innovative drug-calculation methodologies which have been described to
   improve psychomotor skills and build cognitive abilities through a
   greater understanding of mathematics linked to clinical practice.
   Results: Study results showed a significant improvement between the pre-
   and the post-test phases, after the intervention. Pre-test scores ranged
   between 0 and 25 out of a maximum of 30 points, with a mean score of
   15.96 (SD 4.85), and a median score of 17. Post-test scores ranged
   between 15 and 30 out of 30, with a mean score of 25.2 (SD 3.63) and a
   median score of 26 (p<0.001).
   Conclusions: Our study shows that Clinical Skills Workshops may be
   tailored to include teaching techniques that encourage the development
   of drug-dosage calculation skills, and that training strategies
   implemented during a Clinical skills Workshop can enhance students'
   comprehension of mathematical calculations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Application of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) Principles to
   Surgical Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we have faced
   unprecedented challenges in the delivery of surgical education. At the
   time of writing, changes to the structure and nature of the surgical
   workforce are occurring rapidly, even daily. Surgical educators are
   utilizing remote learning solutions, including flipped class-room
   approaches, online educational materials, telemedicine, and simulations,
   to continue education for surgical residents despite cancelations of
   face-to-face instruction. Our objective is to delineate an
   interdisciplinary strategy, utilizing the principles of Universal Design
   for Learning (UDL), by which we can optimize learning during this
   pandemic.
   DESIGN: This perspective describes the UDL framework which can be used
   to situate solutions to issues with delivery of surgical education
   during this pandemic within the broader view of strategic inclusive
   instructional design to meet diverse learning needs..
   CONCLUSION: The principles of UDL can inform curricular and pedagogical
   changes in surgical education that may be employed during a time of
   social distancing, isolation, and quarantine. UDL involves planning
   flexibility into curricular design from the outset, recognizing that
   learners are varied in their learning preferences and capabilities,
   motivational characteristics, and environmental constraints. Viewing the
   design of remote learning opportunities through the UDL lens aims to
   remove barriers to learning during this pandemic by targeting three
   areas: expansion of the means that information is communicated, ways
   that learners are supported and motivated, and approaches to assessing
   learning through available distance learning technologies (C) 2020

Title = {Using multiple self-regulated learning measures to understand medical
   students' biomedical science learning},
Journal = {MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {54},

Pages = {727-737},

Abstract = {Context Understanding self-regulated learning (SRL) is complicated due
   to the different measures used to identify the key SRL processes. There
   is a growing trend in applying event measures of SRL (microanalysis and
   trace) but aptitude measures (questionnaires) continue to be widely used
   in medical education. A major concern is whether aptitude measures are a
   valid approach to capture the dimensions of SRL processes. This study
   examined correlations between SRL microanalysis, SRL trace and the
   Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) and how these
   measures were associated with biomedical science performance. Methods An
   SRL microanalysis assessment interview was administered to 76 first-year
   medical students individually when performing a biomedical science
   learning task. All written materials by students were collected for
   further trace analysis. Students completed an MSLQ 2 weeks before
   completing their biomedical science course. Correlation analyses were
   used to determine the correlations between the three SRL assessment
   measures. Bivariate and multiple analyses were conducted to compare
   students on different course or task performance using the three SRL
   assessment measures. Results Microanalytic metacognitive monitoring
   (kappa = 0.30,P < .001) and causal attributions (kappa = 0.17,P = .009)
   had statistically significant correlations with use of the SRL trace
   strategy. MSLQ self-efficacy correlated with microanalytic self-efficacy
   (r = .39,P = .001). Bivariate tests showed that microanalytic
   metacognitive monitoring, causal attributions and adaptive inferences,
   and SRL trace strategy use had significant associations with task
   performance (P < .05). Microanalytic self-efficacy, metacognitive
   monitoring and causal attributions, SRL trace strategy use and MSLQ
   self-efficacy had significant associations with course performance (P <
   .05). Measures of use of the SRL trace strategy and MSLQ subscales did
   not show significant associations with task and course outcomes in
   multiple analyses (P > .05). Conclusions Event measures, specifically
   SRL microanalysis, had greater associations with both task and course
   outcomes compared with the MSLQ measure. The SRL microanalysis is
   recommended for the assessment of SRL in biomedical science learning.
   However, to fully understand medical students' SRL a multidimensional
   assessment approach that combines event and aptitude measures should be
   used.},

Abstract = {Energy harvesting technology has been widely developed as a promising
   alternative of battery to power embedded systems. However, energy
   harvesting powered embedded systems may have potential frequent power
   interruptions due to unstable energy supply. Nonvolatile processors
   (NVPs) are proposed to survive power failures by saving volatile data to
   nonvolatile memory (NVM) upon power failures and resuming them after
   power comes back. Traditionally, backup is triggered immediately when an
   energy warning occurs. However, it is also possible to more aggressively
   utilize the residual energy for program execution to improve forward
   progress. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement-learning-guided
   backup strategy to improve forward progress in energy harvesting powered
   intermittent embedded systems. The experimental results show an average
   of 8.3\%, 51.6\%, and 325.3\% improved forward progress compared with
   Q-learning, the related work ALD, and traditional instant backup,
   respectively.},

Abstract = {Human-Computer Interaction topics have been previously used to motivate
   and attract students to the field of Computer Science. However, as
   students are growing up in contact with several interactive
   computational devices, one could suspect that they already possess an
   empirical, informal knowledge about the quality of some specific types
   of human-computer interfaces. This informal knowledge may influence how
   these students deal with the construction of interactive artifacts while
   learning programming fundamentals. In order to test this hypothesis, we
   developed a Game Design Workshop to be offered to high school students.
   Based on the results of its first offering, we identified that issues
   related to displaying the game status and score, response time of
   controls and graphical and sound features were quite relevant to
   students. Students added additional features to solve those issues in a
   spontaneous way. An analysis of the developed games indicates that, in
   order to implement the additional features, students had to learn and
   apply programming concepts that were new to them, such as loop
   boundaries and message broadcasting.},

Title = {The process of coping with stress by Taiwanese medical interns: a
   qualitative study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Month = {JAN 12},
Abstract = {Background: Internship, the transition period from medical student to
   junior doctor, is highly stressful for interns in the West; however,
   little is known about the experience of interns in coping with stress in
   Taiwan. This study aimed to develop a model for coping with stress among
   Taiwanese interns and to examine the relationship between stress and
   learning outcomes.
   Methods: For this qualitative study, we used grounded theory methodology
   with theoretical sampling. We collected data through in-depth interviews
   and participant observations. We employed the constant comparative
   method to analyse the data until data saturation was achieved.
   Results: The study population was 124 medical interns in a teaching
   hospital in northern Taiwan; 21 interns (12 males) participated. Data
   analysis revealed that the interns encountered stressors (such as sense
   of responsibility, coping with uncertainty, and interpersonal
   relationships) resulting from their role transition from observer to
   practitioner. The participants used self-directed learning and avoidance
   as strategies to deal with their stress.
   Conclusions: A self-directed learning strategy can be beneficial for an
   intern's motivation to learn as well as for patient welfare. However,
   avoiding stressors can result in less motivation to learn and hinder the
   quality of care. Understanding how interns experience and cope with
   stress and its related outcomes can help medical educators and policy
   makers improve the quality of medical education by encouraging interns'
   self-directed learning strategy and discouraging the avoidance of
   stressors.},

   Strategies utilizing Open Journey Theory},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},

Volume = {71},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Throughout nursing, spirituality is a recognized domain of patient care,
   but nurses feel ill prepared by their nursing education to provide care
   that is spiritual in nature to patients and their families.
   Incorporating spiritual care into nursing curricula is challenging in
   light of the amount of topics for healthcare learning. Open Journey
   Theory is based on the merging of two grounded theories, one teaching
   and one learning theory, and is the suggested framework for integrating
   spirituality and spiritual care across all levels of nursing education.
   Specially chosen readings (books, articles), activities (role-plays,
   discussion groups), and assignments (journaling, writing papers, giving
   reports) can be integrated into already existing courses. By utilizing
   the three stages of preparing, connecting, and reflecting to frame
   student learning, nurse educators can introduce and build on spiritual
   concepts from the simple to the complex over the course of the entire
   nursing program.},

Title = {Nursing student and faculty competency improvement through a
   nurse-bridging program in Cambodia},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {93},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: An adequate number of high-quality nurses are a key factor
   for superior patient outcomes. However, in 2015, Cambodia reported only
   52 nurses with bachelor's degrees, three with master's degrees, and one
   with a doctorate. The fast track to getting a highly educated nursing
   workforce requires providing a bridging program for associate's degree
   nurses to achieve baccalaureate degrees.
   Objectives: To assess improvement in the competency of nursing students
   and faculty members through a program that prepares associate's degree
   nurses to obtain bachelor's degrees in Cambodia.
   Design: Mixed methods.
   Setting: Educational institutes in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.
   Participants: A total of 45 Cambodian nursing students participated in
   the Cambodian nurse-bridging program and 12 Cambodian faculty members
   served as co-teachers.
   Methods: We conducted three surveys to compare the competence of nursing
   students and faculty members before, during, and after the bridging
   program. We conducted focus-group interviews to support the qualitative
   results and explored changes in student and faculty competencies after
   the program.
   Results: Quantitative analysis revealed significant improvements in
   students' nursing competency (p < .001), critical thinking (p < .001),
   and research competency (p < .001) and faculty members' teaching
   competency (p < .001) and research competency (p < .001) after the
   program. Through qualitative analysis, students showed improvement in
   physical assessment, patient communication, critical thinking,
   evidence-based nursing, and research competency. Faculty members
   indicated they had experienced new teaching strategies and subjects,
   gained increased confidence in teaching, and even though research
   competency had been improved, more training was required.
   Conclusions: This study provides evidence to support the effectiveness
   of higher nurse education in developing countries, and illustrates an
   opportunity to produce high-quality human resources in nursing.},

Abstract = {Carrying out real-world software projects in their academic studies
   helps students to understand what they will face in industry, and to
   experience first-hand the challenges involved when working
   collaboratively. Most of the instructional strategies used to help
   students take advantage of these activities focus on supporting agile
   programming, which is appropriate for capstone courses. This is not
   always recommended in initial software engineering project courses,
   however, where novice developers run projects in teams while
   simultaneously taking other courses. To enhance the learning and
   teamwork experience in this latter instructional scenario, this paper
   proposes a formative monitoring method, reflexive weekly monitoring
   (RWM), for use in project courses that involve disciplined software
   processes and loosely coupled work. RWM uses self-reflection and
   collaborative learning practices to help students be aware of their
   individual and team performance. RWM was applied in a case study over
   nine consecutive semesters. The results obtained indicate that RWM was
   effective in enhancing the learning experience in the instructional
   scenario studied. While students in the monitored teams were more
   effective and coordinated, and experienced a higher sense of team
   belonging and satisfaction, little evidence was found of them being more
   productive than students working in non-monitored teams.},

Abstract = {Learning from class-imbalanced data continues to be a common and
   challenging problem in supervised learning as standard classification
   algorithms are designed to handle balanced class distributions. While
   different strategies exist to tackle this problem, methods which
   generate artificial data to achieve a balanced class distribution are
   more versatile than modifications to the classification algorithm. Such
   techniques, called oversampiers, modify the training data, allowing any
   classifier to be used with class-imbalanced datasets. Many algorithms
   have been proposed for this task, but most are complex and tend to
   generate unnecessary noise. This work presents a simple and effective
   oversampling method based on k-means clustering and SMOTE (synthetic
   minority oversampling technique), which avoids the generation of noise
   and effectively overcomes imbalances between and within classes.
   Empirical results of extensive experiments with 90 datasets show that
   training data oversampled with the proposed method improves
   classification results. Moreover, k-means SMOTE consistently outperforms
   other popular oversampling methods. An implementation(1) is made
   available in the Python programming language. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Joint Power Control and Channel Allocation for Interference Mitigation
   Based on Reinforcement Learning},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {177254-177265},
Abstract = {In dense Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), high-density Access
   Points (APs) bring severe interference that seriously affects the
   experience of users, resulting in lower throughput and poor connection
   quality. Due to the heavy computation workload raised by the sizable
   networking systems and the difficulty in estimating instantaneous
   Channel State Information (CSI), existing works are hard to solve
   interference problem. In this paper, we propose a Joint Power control
   and Channel allocation based on Reinforcement Learning (JPCRL) algorithm
   combining with statistical CSI to reduce interference adaptively.
   Firstly, we analyze the correlation between transmit power and channel,
   and formulate the interference optimization as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear
   Programming (MINLP) problem. Secondly, we use the statistical CSI method
   to take the power and channel state as the state and action space, the
   overall throughput increment as the reward function of Q-learning, and
   obtain the optimal joint optimization strategy through off-line
   training. Moreover, for the periodic reinforcement learning process
   leading to resource consumption, we design an event-driven mechanism of
   Q-learning, which triggers online learning to refresh the optimal policy
   by event-driven condition and the consumption of computing resources can
   be reduced. The evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm can
   effectively improve the throughput compared with the existing scheme.},

Title = {The Flipped Classroom: A Course Redesign to Foster Learning and

Abstract = {Recent calls for educational reform highlight ongoing concerns about the
   ability of current curricula to equip aspiring health care professionals
   with the skills for success. Whereas a wide range of proposed solutions
   attempt to address apparent deficiencies in current educational models,
   a growing body of literature consistently points to the need to rethink
   the traditional in-class, lecture-based course model. One such proposal
   is the flipped classroom, in which content is offloaded for students to
   learn on their own, and class time is dedicated to engaging students in
   student-centered learning activities, like problem-based learning and
   inquiry-oriented strategies. In 2012, the authors flipped a required
   first-year pharmaceutics course at the University of North Carolina
   Eshelman School of Pharmacy. They offloaded all lectures to self-paced
   online videos and used class time to engage students in active learning
   exercises. In this article, the authors describe the philosophy and
   methodology used to redesign the Basic Pharmaceutics II course and
   outline the research they conducted to investigate the resulting
   outcomes. This article is intended to serve as a guide to instructors
   and educational programs seeking to develop, implement, and evaluate
   innovative and practical strategies to transform students' learning
   experience. As class attendance, students' learning, and the perceived
   value of this model all increased following participation in the flipped
   classroom, the authors conclude that this approach warrants careful
   consideration as educators aim to enhance learning, improve outcomes,
   and fully equip students to address 21st-century health care needs.},

Abstract = {Undergraduates having their first research experience frequently have
   little idea of what to expect. Institutions offering summer research
   experiences attempt to address this issue through programs that
   introduce students to the process and culture of science. However,
   didactic approaches frequently bore students who prefer more interactive
   sessions. We describe a ``Pass-the-Problem{''} case study approach that
   engages groups of students in useful discussions about the research
   environment they are entering. The cases presented here include keeping
   a thorough laboratory notebook, balancing laboratory and personal time
   demands, anxiety about formal presentations, unexpected federal
   regulatory inspection, working in a lab with limited funds, being used
   as a technician rather than a researcher, frustration with failed
   experiments, effects of promotion and tenure on laboratory atmosphere,
   the importance of reading the research literature, and questioning a
   career in science. These cases alert students to different situations
   they might encounter and stimulate discussion about how to deal with
   them. (C) 2015 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular

Abstract = {We describe a new strategy (concept, methodology, architecture) and
   results of the advanced step of an EU supported TEMPUS (Trans European
   Mobility Program for University Studies) project EOLES (Electronic and
   Optic e-Learning for Embedded Systems). Our aims are combining
   e-technologies and e-pedagogies to create online undergraduate
   theoretical and practical courses in engineering education. The project
   involves 15 institutions from four European countries and three North
   African countries. This project addresses improvement and development of
   a distance learning system (E-Learning), especially at remote
   laboratories where new technology allows learners or researchers to
   create and conduct scientific experiments and deepen their experimental
   knowledge in a real laboratory via the web. Analyses and results of the
   improvement and development of this learning system seek to address
   needs according to three levels. First, it is necessary for this system
   of E-Learning to use and respect the educational and pedagogical
   standards followed in teaching. The second aspect is performance
   concerning the speed and precision of interaction with real laboratory
   equipment and instruments. Thirdly, this system must make the work and
   the tasks easier for the laboratory manager in matters of preparing and
   managing appointments and access to experiments and manipulation. The
   objective remaining for this new strategy and architecture is to create
   a laboratory cloud to be shared by the universities of the world, in
   order to complement them and to mitigate their lack of equipment.},

   Evidence-Based Teaching?},
Journal = {CBE-LIFE SCIENCES EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},

Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Graduate students hold a critical role in responding to national calls
   for increased adoption of evidence-based teaching (EBT) in undergraduate
   classrooms, as they not only serve as teaching assistants, but also
   represent the pool from which future faculty will emerge. Through
   interviews with 32 biology graduate students from 25 institutions
   nationwide, we sought to understand the progress these graduate students
   are making in adopting EBT through qualitative exploration of their
   perceptions of and experiences with both EBT and instructional
   professional development. Initial inductive content analysis of
   interview transcripts guided the holistic placement of participants
   within stages of Rogers's diffusions of innovations model, which we use
   as a theoretical framework to describe the progress of EBT adoption. We
   found that most graduate students in our sample are aware of and value
   EBT, but only 37.5\% have implemented EBT. Many who were progressing
   toward EBT adoption had sought out supplementary instructional
   experiences beyond the requirements of their programs, and 72\%
   perceived an institutional lack of support for teaching-related
   professional development opportunities. These data indicate that, while
   many graduate students are already engaged with the movement to adopt
   EBT, graduate training programs should emphasize increasing access to
   quality training in EBT strategies.},

Title = {The Right Way to Teach Left-Handed Residents: Strategies for Training by
   Right Handers},

Abstract = {PURPOSE: Left-handed (LH) residents remain underrepresented among
   surgical trainees, and there are few available data on how best to train
   them. The challenge is amplified when pairing a LH resident with a
   right-handed (RH) mentor. This report provides recommendations on how to
   improve the training of LH surgeons in a safe and effective manner.\&
   para;\& para;METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was performed
   using different databases and search engines to identify all articles
   relevant to the training of LH residents.\& para;\& para;RESULTS: A
   total of 40 articles highlighted the challenges for LH surgical
   residents and RH mentors. Our recommendations are based on the following
   4 themes: identifying inherent differences in left vs. RH residents,
   providing guidance to RH mentors training LH residents, adapting the RH
   environment to the LH surgeon, and maximizing safety during training.\&
   para;\& para;CONCLUSION: An organized approach needs to be taken in
   training the LH resident. Changes should be instituted at program-wide
   and national levels to ensure that the training experience of the
   sinistral surgical resident is optimized. (C) 2017 Association of

Title = {Model Predictive Iterative Learning Control for Energy Management of
   Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {71323-71334},
Abstract = {A novel optimal energy management strategy (EMS) for plug-in hybrid
   electric vehicle (PHEV) is proposed in this paper, which takes the
   battery health into consideration for prolonging its service life. The
   integrated control framework combines batch-wise iterative learning
   control (ILC) and time-wise model predictive control (MPC), referred to
   as 2D-MPILC. The major advantages of the proposed method are shown with
   better performance as well as faster convergence speed by taking into
   account the time-wise feedback control within the current batch. Then,
   the MPILC method is applied for the PHEV with the ability to make
   continuous period-to-period improvements. Its performances will approach
   dynamic programming (DP)-based method after a learning process with
   satisfying real-time processing capacity. The results in real-world city
   bus routines verify the effectiveness of the proposed EMS for greatly
   improving the performance of the PHEV.},

Abstract = {Phenomenon: Medical students' coping abilities are important for
   academic success and emotional health. The authors explored differences
   in students' use of active, problem-solving strategies and emotional,
   inwardly directed approaches; the change in coping strategies used
   during medical school; and coping strategy impact on performance.
   Approach: One hundred eighty-three students completed the Ways of Coping
   Scale at matriculation and end of the 2nd and 3rd years. Frequency of
   each of 8 ways of coping, changes in coping strategy use over time, and
   relationship of coping method with preclinical and clinical scores were
   calculated. Findings: Students varied widely in use of coping
   mechanisms. Over time, students shifted to using emotional strategies
   more frequently while decreasing their use of active strategies. Coping
   strategies were unrelated to preclinical academic performance (R-2 =
   .09, adjusted R-2 = .04, ns) but were related to clinical performance
   (R-2 = .23, adjusted R-2 = .18, p < .0001), with active coping
   associated with higher performance and emotional methods associated with
   lower performance. Insights: Students decreased use of active coping
   strategies and increased use of emotional coping strategies over time,
   but emotional strategies were associated with poorer clinical academic
   performance. These shifts in coping methods may be detrimental to
   student performance and learning. Improving students' ability to cope
   should be an educational priority.},

Abstract = {Students' metacognitive skills and perceptions are considered important
   variables for high-quality learning. In this study, students'
   perceptions were used to identify histological threshold concepts
   (integrative, irreversible, transformative, and troublesome) in three
   health sciences curricula. A specific questionnaire was developed and
   validated to characterize students' perceptions of histological
   threshold concepts. A sample of 410 undergraduate students enrolled in
   the dentistry, medicine, and pharmacy degree programs participated in
   the study. Concepts assessed in the study were clustered to ten
   categories (factors) by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis.
   Concepts linked to tissue organization and tissue functional states
   received the highest scores from students in all degree programs,
   suggesting that the process of learning histology requires the
   integration of both static concepts related to the constituent elements
   of tissues and dynamic concepts such as stem cells as a tissue renewal
   substrate, or the euplasic, proplasic and retroplasic states of tissues.
   The complexity of integrating static and dynamic concepts may pose a
   challenging barrier to the comprehension of histology. In addition,
   several differences were detected among the students in different degree
   programs. Dentistry students more often perceived morphostructural
   concepts as threshold concepts, whereas medical students highlighted
   concepts related to two-dimensional microscopic identification. Lastly,
   pharmacy students identified concepts related to tissue general activity
   as critical for the comprehension and learning of histology. The
   identification of threshold concepts through students' perceptions is
   potentially useful to improve the teaching and learning process in
   health sciences curricula.},

Abstract = {In this paper we present a framework for automatic exploitation of news
   in stock trading strategies. Events are extracted from news messages
   presented in free text without annotations. We test the introduced
   framework by deriving trading strategies based on technical indicators
   and impacts of the extracted events. The strategies take the form of
   rules that combine technical trading indicators with a news variable,
   and are revealed through the use of genetic programming. We find that
   the news variable is often included in the optimal trading rules,
   indicating the added value of news for predictive purposes and
   validating our proposed framework for automatically incorporating news
   in stock trading strategies.},

Abstract = {Remote Access Laboratories (RALs) have been used to develop experimental
   knowledge about practical engineering topics for a while. Distributed
   remote laboratories aim to share experiment among institutions and
   individuals through a distributed architecture. Experiments from diverse
   areas are combined as part of a larger system. Multiple control
   strategies are used to integrate experiments in Remote Laboratory
   Management Systems (RLMSs). This work defines two main categories to
   analyze the various implementations, white box and black box approaches.
   Experiments can be on a spectrum between these two extremes, sharing
   properties of both. When integrating an existing experiment into a new
   distributed RAL system, it is useful to evaluate the experiment with
   respect to its host or new RLMS for determining the best strategies to
   assimilate it. This paper provides a framework for such evaluation based
   on a number of properties of experiments. The proposed framework is
   called SHASS (Software, Hardware, Assessment, Support, and
   Share-ability) based on several factors such as the hardware used, the
   software to create the program, methods of sharing, user's support, and
   assessment of user's performance. It can be used to evaluate quality and
   identify options for improvements within an experiment's existing RLMS
   as well. Using this framework, a black box and white box approach are
   compared using two examples federated and Peer-to-Peer RAL. The
   evaluation focuses on technical capabilities and development
   possibilities. A set of four experiments are also analysed to illustrate
   the utility of the framework in creating and improving experiments with
   respect to their RLMS.},

Abstract = {The Google Artificial Intelligence (AI) Challenge is an international
   contest the objective of which is to program the AI in a two-player real
   time strategy (RTS) game. This AI is an autonomous computer program that
   governs the actions that one of the two players executes during the game
   according to the state of play. The entries are evaluated via a
   competition mechanism consisting of two-player rounds where each entry
   is tested against others. This paper describes the use of competitive
   coevolutionary (CC) algorithms for the automatic generation of winning
   game strategies in Planet Wars, the RTS game associated with the 2010
   contest. Three different versions of a prime algorithm have been tested.
   Their common nexus is not only the use of a Hall-of-Fame (HoF) to keep
   note of the winners of past coevolutions but also the employment of an
   archive of experienced players, termed the hall-of-celebrities (HoC),
   that puts pressure on the optimization process and guides the search to
   increase the strength of the solutions; their differences come from the
   periodical updating of the HoF on the basis of quality and diversity
   metrics. The goal is to optimize the AI by means of a self-learning
   process guided by coevolutionary search and competitive evaluation. An
   empirical study on the performance of a number of variants of the
   proposed algorithms is described and a statistical analysis of the
   results is conducted. In addition to the attainment of competitive bots
   we also conclude that the incorporation of the HoC inside the primary
   algorithm helps to reduce the effects of cycling caused by the use of
   HoF in CC algorithms.},

Abstract = {We design a joint radio and computational resource allocation policy for
   a multi-user mobile edge computing system, such that the expected power
   consumption is minimized while satisfying long-term delay constraints.
   The problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process
   (CMDP) that is efficiently solved by the proposed constrained
   reinforcement learning (CRL) algorithm, called successive convex
   programming based policy optimization (SCPPO). SCPPO solves a convex
   objective/feasibility surrogate problem at each update and it can
   provably converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the original
   CMDP problem almost surely under some mild conditions. Moreover, SCPPO
   adopts an application-specific policy architecture and employs a
   data-efficient estimation strategy that can reuse old experiences, such
   that SCPPO can realize fast learning with low computational complexity.},

Title = {Cognitive integration in health professions education: Development and
   implementation of a collaborative learning workshop in an undergraduate
   nursing program},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {90},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Cognitive integration is integral to health professions education as it
   facilitates the ability to synthesize various types of knowledge and
   apply them in a clinical context. Nursing education is one main field of
   study that is subsumed under the umbrella of health professions
   education. Future nurses require learning, not just of skills but also
   of the knowledge that underpins those skills. They need to be able to
   cognitively integrate various forms of content and skills so that they
   can translate them to actual patient management and care during clinical
   practice. Several educational strategies have been implemented and have
   been shown to be effective in promoting cognitive integration in health
   professions learners, both individually and as a group. One of these
   strategies is collaborative learning. This study describes how a
   developed collaborative learning workshop was implemented to aid
   cognitive integration in year 1 undergraduate nursing students prior to
   their clinical postings. It also looks into the perceptions of students
   through qualitative findings from focus group discussions. Generated
   themes include `integrating and bridging knowledge for practice',
   `having tutors with different and complementing expertise', `preparing
   mindsets by clear objectives' and `timing and case variability'.},

Abstract = {Extracting rules from stock market data is an important and exciting
   problem, where investment decisions should be as clear and intuitive as
   possible in order for investors to choose the composition of their
   portfolios. Thus, it is important to guarantee that this process is done
   with a good framework and reliable techniques. In this context,
   portfolio composition is a puzzle with respect to selecting the
   appropriate assets and the optimal timing to invest. There are several
   models and algorithms to make these decisions, and in recent years,
   machine learning applications have been used to solve this puzzle with
   exceptional results. This technique allows a large amount of data to be
   processed, resulting in more informed recommendations on which asset to
   choose. Our study uses strongly typed genetic programming to generate
   rules to buy, hold and sell stocks in the US stock market, considering a
   rolling windows approach. We propose a different training approach,
   focusing the fitness function on a ternary decision based on the return
   prediction of each stock analyzed. The ternary rule matches perfectly
   with the three decisions: buy, hold and sell. Therefore, the rules are
   simple, intuitive, and easy for investors to understand. The results
   show that the proposed algorithm generates higher profits than the
   classical optimization approach. Moreover, the profits obtained are
   higher than the buy-and-hold strategy and the return of the indexes
   representative of the US stock market.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on developing new algorithms for distributed
   cooperative learning based on zero-gradient-sum (ZGS) optimization in a
   network setting. Specifically, the feed forward neural network with
   random weights (FNNRW) is introduced to train on data distributed across
   multiple learning agents, and each agent runs the program on a subset of
   the entire data. In this scheme, there is no requirement for a fusion
   center, due to, e.g., practical limitations, security, or privacy
   reasons. The centralized FNNRW problem is reformulated into an
   equivalent separable form with consensus constraints among nodes and is
   solved by the ZGS-based distributed optimization strategy, which
   theoretically guarantees convergence to the optimal solution. The
   proposed method is more effective than the existing methods using the
   decentralized average consensus (DAC) and alternating direction method
   of multipliers (ADMM) strategies. It is simple and requires less
   computational and communication resources, which is well suited for
   potential applications, such as wireless sensor networks, artificial
   intelligence, and computational biology, involving datasets that are
   often extremely large, high-dimensional and located on distributed data
   sources. We show simulation results on both synthetic and real-world
   datasets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of machine learning, artificial intelligence
   (AI) has drawn much more attention. Under this circumstances, abstract
   strategy games, such as chess, checkers and Go, have been a fascinating
   problem of AI research. Most of the existing state-of-the-art Go
   programs used deep neural network technology, like convolutional neural
   networks (CNNs). However, CNNs require multiple iterations to optimize
   weights and spend a lot of training time. Therefore, in this paper, in
   order to solve the above shortcomings, we propose a new learning
   algorithm ECNN, which integrates CNNs with extreme learning machine
   (ELM). We remove pooling layers of CNNs and insert ELM layers between
   convolutional layers. The newly added ELM layers will be updated in
   back-propagation process, and they accelerate the convergence of weights
   in CNNs. Therefore, our ECNN can reduce the training time of CNNs.
   Further, we propose ECNN-Go algorithm, which applies ECNN to Go game.
   Because of the advantage of ECNN, ECNN-Go algorithm has the fast
   learning speed to make move prediction in Go game. Finally, the
   experimental results show the efficiency and accuracy of ECNN algorithm
   and demonstrate the strength of ECNN-Go.},

Title = {Edge Server Deployment for Health Monitoring With Reinforcement Learning
   in Internet of Medical Things},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 APR 12},
Abstract = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has recently gained a lot of
   interest in the health care industry. IoMT enables real-time and
   omnipresent monitoring of a patient's health status, resulting in
   massive amounts of medical data being generated. The centralized massive
   data processing places enormous strain on the typical cloud computing,
   rendering it incapable of supporting a variety of real-time health care
   applications. Therefore, edge computing that moves application programs
   and data processing from central infrastructure to the edge nodes has
   attracted wide attention. However, adopting existing edge server (ES)
   deployment strategies for IoMT is not suitable due to the decentralized
   and high real-time service requirements of IoMT systems. In particular,
   traditional ES deployment strategies in IoMT system confront major load
   imbalance across ESs, latency issues, and energy consumption concerns.
   To address these challenges, a deployment strategy of ESs based on the
   state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA) learning, named ESL, is
   designed. Specifically, ESs are quantified by evaluating the silhouette
   coefficient (SC) and the sum of squared errors. Then, through fuzzy
   C-means (FCM) algorithm, the preliminary division of health monitoring
   units (HMUs) and the initial locations of ESs are obtained. Finally,
   SARSA learning is adopted to determine the deployment of ESs.
   Furthermore, extensive experiments and analyses confirm that ESL
   achieves the core objective of optimizing load balancing among ESs while
   also optimizing request-response latency and request processing energy
   consumption.},

Title = {Transition to active learning in rural Nepal: an adaptable and scalable
   curriculum development model},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {BackgroundTraditional medical education in much of the world has
   historically relied on passive learning. Although active learning has
   been in the medical education literature for decades, its incorporation
   into practice has been inconsistent. We describe and analyze the
   implementation of a multidisciplinary continuing medical education
   curriculum in a rural Nepali district hospital, for which a core
   objective was an organizational shift towards active learning.MethodsThe
   intervention occurred in a district hospital in remote Nepal, staffed
   primarily by mid-level providers. Before the intervention, education
   sessions included traditional didactics. We conducted a mixed-methods
   needs assessment to determine the content and educational strategies for
   a revised curriculum. Our goal was to develop an effective, relevant,
   and acceptable curriculum, which could facilitate active learning. As
   part of the intervention, physicians acted as both learners and teachers
   by creating and delivering lectures. Presenters used lecture templates
   to prioritize clarity, relevance, and audience engagement, including
   discussion questions and clinical cases. Two 6-month curricular cycles
   were completed during the study period. Daily lecture evaluations
   assessed ease of understanding, relevance, clinical practice change, and
   participation. Periodic lecture audits recorded learner talk-time, the
   proportion of lecture time during which learners were talking, as a
   surrogate for active learning. Feedback from evaluation and audit
   results was provided to presenters, and pre- and post-curriculum
   knowledge assessment exams were conducted.ResultsLecture audits showed a
   significant increase in learner talk-time, from 14\% at baseline to 30\%
   between months 3-6, maintained at 31\% through months 6-12. Lecture
   evaluations demonstrated satisfaction with the curriculum. Pre- and
   post-curriculum knowledge assessment scores improved from 50 to 64\%
   (difference 13.3\%4.5\%, p=0.006). As an outcome for the measure of
   organizational change, the curriculum was replicated at an additional
   clinical site.Conclusion: We demonstrate that active learning can be
   facilitated by implementing a new educational strategy. Lecture audits
   proved useful for internal program improvement. The components of the
   intervention which are transferable to other rural settings include the
   use of learners as teachers, lecture templates, and provision of
   immediate feedback. This curricular model could be adapted to similar
   settings in Nepal, and globally.},

Title = {Automated Pre-Play Analysis of American Football Formations Using Deep
   Learning},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Annotation and analysis of sports videos is a time-consuming task that,
   once automated, will provide benefits to coaches, players, and
   spectators. American football, as the most watched sport in the United
   States, could especially benefit from this automation. Manual annotation
   and analysis of recorded videos of American football games is an
   inefficient and tedious process. Currently, most college football
   programs focus on annotating offensive formations to help them develop
   game plans for their upcoming games. As a first step to further research
   for this unique application, we use computer vision and deep learning to
   analyze an overhead image of a football play immediately before the play
   begins. This analysis consists of locating individual football players
   and labeling their position or roles, as well as identifying the
   formation of the offensive team. We obtain greater than 90\% accuracy on
   both player detection and labeling, and 84.8\% accuracy on formation
   identification. These results prove the feasibility of building a
   complete American football strategy analysis system using artificial
   intelligence. Collecting a larger dataset in real-world situations will
   enable further improvements. This would likewise enable American
   football teams to analyze game footage quickly.},

Title = {Effectiveness of Three-Dimensional Digital Animation in Teaching Human

Abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) digital animations were used to teach the human
   musculoskeletal system to first year kinesiology students. The purpose
   of this study was to assess the effectiveness of this method by
   comparing two groups from two different academic years during two of
   their official required anatomy examinations (trunk and upper limb
   assessments). During the upper limb section, the teacher used
   two-dimensional (2D) drawings embedded into PowerPoint((R)) slides and
   3D digital animations for the first group (2D group) and the second (3D
   group), respectively. The same 3D digital animations were used for both
   groups during the trunk section. The only difference between the two was
   the multimedia used to present the information during the upper limb
   section. The 2D group surprisingly outperformed the 3D group on the
   trunk assessment. On the upper limb assessment no difference in the
   scores on the overall anatomy examination was found. However, the 3D
   group outperformed the 2D group in questions requiring spatial ability.
   Data supported that 3D digital animations were effective instructional
   multimedia material tools in teaching human anatomy especially in
   recalling anatomical knowledge requiring spatial ability. The importance
   of evaluating the effectiveness of a new instructional material outside
   laboratory environment (e.g., after a complete semester and on official
   examinations) was discussed. Anat Sci Educ 7: 430-437. (c) 2014 American

Abstract = {We present a new framework for sequential information collection in
   applications where regression is used to learn about a set of unknown
   parameters and alternates with optimization to design new data points.
   Such problems can be handled using the framework of ranking and
   selection (R\&S), but traditional R\&S procedures will experience high
   computational costs when the decision space grows combinatorially. This
   challenge arises in many applications of business analytics; in
   particular, we are motivated by the problem of efficiently learning
   effective strategies for nonprofit fundraising. We present a value of
   information procedure for simultaneously learning unknown regression
   parameters and unknown sampling noise. We then develop approximate
   versions of the procedure, based on optimal quantization, that retain
   good performance and scale better to large problems.},

Title = {Lifelong learning of Chinese rural physicians: preliminary psychometrics
   and influencing factors},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Month = {OCT 30},
Abstract = {Background: There are more than 4.9 million rural health workers
   undertaking the health care need of rural population of over 629 million
   in China. The lifelong learning of physicians is vital in maintaining
   up-to-date and qualified health care, but rural physicians in many
   developing countries lack adequate medical professional developments.
   There has also been no empirical research focused on the lifelong
   learning of rural physician populations. The purpose of this study was
   to investigate the primary levels of lifelong learning of the rural
   physicians and to analyze group differences.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 1197 rural physicians
   using the Jefferson Scale of Physician Lifelong Learning (JSPLL).
   Cronbach's a coefficient, exploratory factor analysis, independent
   sample t-test, and one-way ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Keuls test
   were performed to analyze the data.
   Results: For Chinese rural physicians, the JSPLL was reliable
   (Cronbach's a coefficient = 0.872) and valid, with exploratory factor
   analysis fitting a 3-factor model and accounting for a total of 60.46 \%
   of the variance. The mean lifelong learning score was 45.56. Rural
   physicians generally performed worse in the technical skills in seeking
   information domain. Rural physicians with 21-30 working years have a
   lower score of lifelong learning (P < 0.05) than other phases of working
   years. Career satisfaction and professional titles had a significantly
   positive influence on physicians' orientation towards lifelong learning
   (P < 0.05). The overall lifelong learning scores of physicians who
   received more training after completion of medical school were higher
   than those with less additional post-medical school training (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: The JSPLL is effective for the Chinese rural physician
   population. In order to cope with impacting factors on rural physicians'
   lifelong learning, the results of the study reinforced the importance of
   continuing medical education and career satisfaction for lifelong
   learning and the need for medical schools and hospitals to provide
   reasonable strategies and necessary support for rural physicians with
   different amounts of working years. Providing rural physicians more
   educational opportunities and helping them access educational resources
   may be an effective strategy for improving their orientation to lifelong
   learning.},

Abstract = {We describe here a collective and experimental research project-based
   learning (ERPBL) for master's students that can be used to illustrate
   some basic concepts on glucose/lipid homeostasis and renal function
   around a topical issue. The primary objective of this ERPBL was to
   strengthen students' knowledge and understanding of physiology and
   pathophysiology. The secondary objectives were to help students to
   develop technical/practical abilities and acquire transversal skills
   with real-world connections. Obesity is a worldwide public health
   problem that increases the risk for developing type 2 diabetes and
   nephropathies. To study the impact of western dietary habits, students
   evaluated the effects of a diet enriched with fat and cola {[}high-fat
   and cola diet (HFCD)] on metabolism and renal function in mice. Students
   mainly worked in tandem to prepare and perform experiments, but also
   collectively to compile, analyze, and discuss data. Students showed that
   HFCD-fed mice 1) developed obesity; 2) exhibited glucose homeostasis
   impairments associated to ectopic fat storage; and 3) displayed reduced
   glomerular filtration. The educational benefit of the program was
   estimated using three evaluation metrics: a conventional multicriteria
   assessment by teachers, a pre-/posttest, and a self-evaluation
   questionnaire. They showed that the current approach successfully
   strengthened scientific student knowledge and understanding of
   physiology/pathophysiology. In addition, it helped students develop new
   skills, such as technical and transversal skills. We concluded that this
   ERPBL dealing with the pathophysiology of obesity was strongly
   beneficial for master's students, thereby appearing as an efficient and
   performing educational tool.},

Title = {A mixed-methods study of the effectiveness and perceptions of a course
   design institute for health science educators},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},

Month = {DEC 16},
Abstract = {Background: Most health care professionals get their start in academics
   without formal teaching training. As such, institutions encourage
   participation in opportunities to address gaps in faculty's knowledge of
   pedagogy and learning theory in order to promote both successful student
   and patient outcomes. This study aimed to examine the reception of a
   faculty development program focused on teaching participants the basics
   of course design.Methods: Applying a mixed-method approach, this
   retrospective study used pre/post-tests, assignment grades,
   self-assessment questionnaires, and focus groups to elucidate the impact
   of the faculty development intervention on course design. The
   participants (n = 12) were health educators from a private all-graduate
   level university with campus locations across the United States,
   including in the Southwest and Midwest. In the Course Design Institute
   (CDI), the participating faculty learned evidence-based instructional
   approaches and techniques to implement contemporary teaching
   practices.Results: The data from the pre/post-tests and focus groups
   suggest that participants learned about topics including instructional
   alignment, learning goals and objectives, instructional strategies,
   assessment planning, feedback approaches, communicating expectations,
   and adult learning theories by participating in this course. The final
   deliverable scores indicate that the CDI graduates were able to apply a
   backward design process to plan their own instruction. Data from both
   the survey and the focus groups suggest that participants were satisfied
   with the experience and particularly appreciated that the course was
   relevant to them as educators in the health sciences.Conclusions: The
   results of this study indicate that the CDI was influential in
   developing the faculty's knowledge of the course design process,
   promoted the application of course design and pedagogy skills amongst
   CDI graduates, and positively impacted self-reported attitudes about
   their teaching abilities. In addition, feedback from participants
   indicates that they recognized the value of this program in their own
   development and they believed it should be a required course for all
   educators at the institution.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes and designs a best path selection algorithm, which
   can solve the problem of path planning for intelligent driving vehicles
   in the case of restricted driving, traffic congestions and accidents. We
   tried to solve the problem under these emergency situations in path
   planing process for there's no driver in intelligent driving vehicle. We
   designed a new method of the best path selection with length priority
   based on the prior knowledge applied reinforcement learning strategy,
   and improved the search direction setting of A({*}) shortest path
   algorithm in the program. This best path planing algorithm can
   effectively help different types of intelligent driving vehicles to
   select the best path in the traffic network with limited height, width
   and weight, accidents and traffic jams. Through simulation experiments
   and practical test, it is proved that the proposed algorithm has good
   stability, high efficiency and practicability.},

Title = {Optimised Learning from Demonstrations for Collaborative Robots},
Journal = {ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2021},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The approach of Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) can support human
   operators especially those without much programming experience to
   control a collaborative robot (cobot) in an intuitive and convenient
   means. Gaussian Mixture Model and Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMM and
   GMR) are useful tools for implementing such a LfD approach. However,
   well-performed GMM/GMR require a series of demonstrations without
   trembling and jerky features, which are challenging to achieve in actual
   environments. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel
   optimised approach to improve Gaussian clusters then further GMM/GMR so
   that LfD enabled cobots can carry out a variety of complex manufacturing
   tasks effectively. This research has three distinguishing innovative
   characteristics: 1) a Gaussian noise strategy is designed to scatter
   demonstrations with trembling and jerky features to better support the
   optimisation of GMM/GMR; 2) a Simulated Annealing-Reinforcement Learning
   (SA-RL) based optimisation algorithm is developed to refine the number
   of Gaussian clusters in eliminating potential under-/over-fitting issues
   on GMM/GMR; 3) a B-spline based cut-in algorithm is integrated with GMR
   to improve the adaptability of reproduced solutions for dynamic
   manufacturing tasks. To verify the approach, cases studies of
   pick-and-place tasks with different complexities were conducted.
   Experimental results and comparative analyses showed that this developed
   approach exhibited good performances in terms of computational
   efficiency, solution quality and adaptability.},

Title = {Establishing an Integrative Medicine Program Within an Academic Health

Abstract = {Integrative medicine ( IM) refers to the combination of conventional and
   ``complementary{''} medical services ( e.g., chiropractic, acupuncture,
   massage, mindfulness training). More than half of all medical schools in
   the United States and Canada have programs in IM, and more than 30
   academic health centers currently deliver multidisciplinary IM care.
   What remains unclear, however, is the ideal delivery model ( or models)
   whereby individuals can responsibly access IM care safely, effectively,
   and reproducibly in a coordinated and cost-effective way.
   Current models of IM across existing clinical centers vary tremendously
   in their organizational settings, principal clinical focus, and services
   provided; practitioner team composition and training; incorporation of
   research activities and educational programs; and administrative
   organization ( e.g., reporting structure, use of medical records, scope
   of clinical practice) and financial strategies ( i.e., specific business
   plans and models for sustainability).
   In this article, the authors address these important strategic issues by
   sharing lessons learned from the design and implementation of an IM
   facility within an academic teaching hospital, the Brigham and Women's
   Hospital at Harvard Medical School; and review alternative options based
   on information about IM centers across the United States.
   The authors conclude that there is currently no consensus as to how
   integrative care models should be optimally organized, implemented,
   replicated, assessed, and funded. The time may be right for prospective
   research in ``best practices{''} across emerging models of IM care
   nationally in an effort to standardize, refine, and replicate them in
   preparation for rigorous cost-effectiveness evaluations.},

Title = {Optimal Incentive Strategy in Cloud-Edge Integrated Demand Response
   Framework for Residential Air Conditioning Loads},

Abstract = {In the residential demand response area, currently the incentive-based
   method (e.g., direct load control, DLC) may impair users' comfort and
   autonomy, while the price-based method can hardly guarantee users'
   engagements. This paper proposes an edge-cloud integrated demand
   response framework to achieve an effect-predictable residential demand
   response without harming users' benefits. First, we combine the
   cloud-computing resource (cloud) and the home-installed smart
   thermostats (edges) to formulate an efficient, cost-effective, and
   data-secured infrastructure to implement the demand response program.
   Then, we model the demand response problem between the load aggregator
   and its served residential users as a bi-level optimization problem, and
   the key is for the load aggregator to find the optimal incentive
   strategy. To solve this problem, we introduce an RL algorithm, i.e.,
   Continuous Action Reinforcement Learning Automata, to quickly obtain the
   optimal incentive strategy under an incomplete information scenario.
   Simulation results based on 136 real-world residential users in Austin
   area demonstrate that the proposed CEI-DR framework can increase the
   social welfare by about \$8.6/h compared to the traditional DLC method
   during a normal DR event.},

Title = {Enhancing student perspectives of humanism in medicine: reflections from
   the Kalaupapa service learning project},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Month = {MAY 9},
Abstract = {Background: Service learning is endorsed by the Liaison Committee on
   Medical Education (LCME) as an integral part of U.S. medical school
   curricula for future physicians. Service learning has been shown to help
   physicians in training rediscover the altruistic reasons for pursuing
   medicine and has the potential to enhance students' perspectives of
   humanism in medicine. The Kalaupapa service learning project is a unique
   collaboration between disadvantaged post-baccalaureate students with an
   underserved rural community. This study was conducted to determine
   whether the Kalaupapa service learning curricula enhanced student
   perspectives of humanism in medicine at an early stage of their medical
   training.
   Method: Program participants between 2008 and 2014 (n = 41) completed
   written reflections following the conclusion of the service learning
   project. Four prompts guided student responses. Reflections were
   thematically analyzed. Once all essays were read, team members compared
   their findings to condense or expand themes and assess levels of
   agreement.
   Results: Emerging themes of resilience and unity were prominent
   throughout the student reflections. Students expressed respect and
   empathy for the patients' struggles and strengths, as well as those of
   their peers. The experience also reinforced students' commitment to
   service, particularly to populations in rural and underserved
   communities. Students also gained a deeper understanding of the patient
   experience and also of themselves as future physicians.
   Conclusion: To identify and address underserved and rural patients'
   health care needs, training programs must prepare an altruistic health
   care workforce that embraces the humanistic element of medicine. The
   Kalaupapa service learning project is a potential curricular model that
   can be used to enhance students' awareness and perspectives of humanism
   in medicine.},

Abstract = {Community-based participatory research (CBPR) and service-learning are
   unique experiential approaches designed to train medical students how to
   provide individualized patient care from a population perspective.
   Medical schools in the US are required to provide support for
   service-learning and community projects. Despite this requirement, few
   medical schools offer structured service-learning. We developed the
   Community Action Research Track (CART) to integrate population medicine,
   health promotion/disease prevention and the social determinants of
   health into the medical school curriculum through CBPR and
   service-learning experiences. This article provides an overview of CART
   and reports the program impact based on students' participation,
   preliminary evaluations and accomplishments. CART is an optional 4-year
   service-learning experience for medical students interested in community
   health. The curriculum includes a coordinated longitudinal program of
   electives, community service-learning and lecture-based instruction.
   From 2009-2015, 146 CART students participated. Interests in public
   health (93\%), community service (73\%), primary care (73\%), CBPR
   (60\%) and community medicine (60\%) were the top reasons for enrolment.
   Significant improvements in mean knowledge were found when measuring the
   principles of CBPR, levels of prevention, determining health literacy
   and patient communication strategies (all p's < 0.05). Most students
   (73\%) were satisfied with CART. Projects were disseminated by at least
   65 posters and four oral presentations at local, national and
   international professional meetings. Six manuscripts were published in
   peer-reviewed journals. CART is an innovative curriculum for training
   future physicians to be community-responsive physicians. CART can be
   replicated by other medical schools interested in offering a
   longitudinal CBPR and service-learning track in an urban metropolitan
   setting.},

Abstract = {The hunger games search (HGS) algorithm is a recently proposed
   population-based optimization algorithm that mimics a common phenomenon
   of animals searching for food due to hunger stimuli and has a simple and
   easy-to- understand structure. However, the original HGS still suffers
   from shortcomings, such as low population diversity and the tendency to
   fall into local optima. To remedy these shortcomings, an improved HGS,
   called OCBHGS, is proposed, which introduces three main strategies,
   namely the chaotic initialization strategy, the Gaussian barebone
   mechanism, and the orthogonal learning strategy. Firstly, chaotic
   mapping is used for initialization to improve the quality of the
   initialized population. Secondly, the embedding of the Gaussian barebone
   mechanism effectively improves the diversity of the population,
   facilitates the communication between members, and helps the population
   avoid falling into local optima. Finally, the orthogonal learning
   strategy can extend the domain exploration and improve the solution
   accuracy of the algorithm. We conducted extensive experiments in the
   CEC2014 competition benchmark function, comparing OCBHGS with nine other
   metaheuristics and 12 improved algorithms. Also, the experimental
   results were evaluated using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to analyze the
   experimental results comprehensively. In addition, OCBHGS was used to
   solve three constrained real-world engineering problems. The
   experimental results show that OCBHGS has a significant advantage in
   convergence speed and accuracy. As a result, OCBHGS ranks first in
   overall performance compared to other optimizers.},

Abstract = {Optimization of clinical veterinary education requires an understanding
   of what compels veterinary preceptors in their role as clinical
   educators, what satisfaction they receive from the teaching experience,
   and what struggles they encounter while supervising students in private
   practice. We explored veterinary preceptors' teaching motivations,
   enjoyment, and challenges by undertaking a thematic content analysis of
   97 questionnaires and 17 semi-structured telephone interviews. Preceptor
   motivations included intrinsic factors (obligation to the profession,
   maintenance of competence, satisfaction) and extrinsic factors
   (promotion of the veterinary field, recruitment). Veterinarians enjoyed
   observing the learner (motivation and enthusiasm, skill development) and
   engaging with the learner (sharing their passion for the profession,
   developing professional relationships). Challenges for veterinary
   preceptors included variability in learner interest and engagement, time
   management, and lack of guidance from the veterinary medicine program.
   We found dynamic interactions among the teaching motivations, enjoyment,
   and challenges for preceptors. Our findings suggest that in order to
   sustain the veterinary preceptor, there is a need to recognize the
   interplay between the incentives and disincentives for teaching, to
   foster the motivations and enjoyment for teaching, and to mitigate the
   challenges of teaching in community private practice.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUNDAccording to commercial marketing theory, a market orientation
   leads to improved performance. Drawing on the social marketing
   principles of segmentation and audience research, the current study
   seeks to identify segments to examine responses to a school-based
   alcohol social marketing program.
   METHODSA sample of 371 year 10 students (aged: 14-16years; 51.4\% boys)
   participated in a prospective (pre-post) multisite alcohol social
   marketing program. Game On: Know Alcohol (GO:KA) program included 6,
   student-centered, and interactive lessons to teach adolescents about
   alcohol and strategies to abstain or moderate drinking. A repeated
   measures design was used. Baseline demographics, drinking attitudes,
   drinking intentions, and alcohol knowledge were cluster analyzed to
   identify segments. Change on key program outcome measures and
   satisfaction with program components were assessed by segment.
   RESULTSThree segments were identified; (1) Skeptics, (2) Risky Males,
   (3) Good Females. Segments 2 and 3 showed greatest change in drinking
   attitudes and intentions. Good Females reported highest satisfaction
   with all program components and Skeptics lowest program satisfaction
   with all program components.
   CONCLUSIONThree segments, each differing on psychographic and
   demographic variables, exhibited different change patterns following
   participation in GO:KA. Post hoc analysis identified that satisfaction
   with program components differed by segment offering opportunities for
   further research.},

Abstract = {Aircraft dynamics and control (ADC) is a core course requirement for an
   undergraduate program in aeronautical engineering. This article presents
   an undertaking that reconfigures the instruction of fundamental concepts
   in ADC by replacing traditional problem-solving approach with a method
   that relies on a simulation framework comprising of Matlab, USAF DATCOM,
   and flight simulation software. The typical challenges experienced by
   students including their inability to visualize complicated, multi-modal
   aircraft were overcome by the new method thus enhancing the student's
   learning experience. The implemented approach improved students'
   motivational belief and its calibration, their use of active learning
   strategies and actual performance. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Title = {Toward Emotion-Aware Computing: A Loop Selection Approach Based on
   Machine Learning for Speculative Multithreading},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Pages = {3675-3686},
Abstract = {Emotion-aware computing can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate
   human affects. These programs in this area are compute-intensive
   applications, so they need to be executed in parallel. Loops usually
   have regular structures and programs spend significant amounts of time
   executing them, and thus loops are ideal candidates for exploiting the
   parallelism of sequential programs. However, it is difficult to decide
   which set of loops should be parallelized to improve program
   performance. The existing research is one-size-fits-all strategy and
   cannot guarantee to select profitable loops to be parallelized. This
   paper proposes a novel loop selection approach based on machine learning
   (ML-based) for selecting the profitable loops and paralleling them on
   multi-core by speculative multithreading (SpMT). It includes
   establishing sufficient training examples, building and applying
   prediction model to select profitable loops for speculative
   parallelization. Using the ML-based loop selection approach, an unseen
   emotion-aware sequential program can obtain a stable, much higher
   speedup than the one-size-fits-all approach. On Prophet, which is a
   generic SpMT processor to evaluate the performance of multithreaded
   programs, the novel loop selection approach is evaluated and reaches an
   average speedup of 1.87 on a 4-core processor. Experiment results show
   that the ML-based approach can obtain a significant increase in speedup,
   and Olden benchmarks deliver a better performance improvement of 6.70\%
   on a 4-core than the one-size-fits-all approach.},

Title = {The assessment of a structured online formative assessment program: a
   randomised controlled trial},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JAN 9},
Abstract = {Background: Online formative assessment continues to be an important
   area of research and methods which actively engage the learner and
   provide useful learning outcomes are of particular interest. This study
   reports on the outcomes of a two year study of medical students using
   formative assessment tools.
   Method: The study was conducted over two consecutive years using two
   different strategies for engaging students. The Year 1 strategy involved
   voluntary use of the formative assessment tool by 129 students. In Year
   2, a second cohort of 130 students was encouraged to complete the
   formative assessment by incorporating summative assessment elements into
   it. Outcomes from pre and post testing students around the formative
   assessment intervention were used as measures of learning. To compare
   improvement scores between the two years a two-way Analysis of Variance
   (ANOVA) model was fitted to the data.
   Results: The ANOVA model showed that there was a significant difference
   in improvement scores between students in the two years (mean
   improvement percentage 19\% vs. 38.5\%, p < 0.0001). Students were more
   likely to complete formative assessment items if they had a summative
   component. In Year 2, the time spent using the formative assessment tool
   had no impact on student improvement, nor did the number of assessment
   items completed.
   Conclusion: The online medium is a valuable learning resource, capable
   of providing timely formative feedback and stimulating student-centered
   learning. However the production of quality content is a time-consuming
   task and careful consideration must be given to the strategies employed
   to ensure its efficacy. Course designers should consider the potential
   positive impact summative components to formative assessment may have on
   student engagement and outcomes.},

Title = {Grouping workers with similar learning profiles in mass customization
   production lines},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Mass Customization (MC) implies in large product variety and reduced
   production batch sizes. Tasks that rely on human ability are especially
   affected in this context as workers must quickly adapt to the
   requirements of new models. That adaptation process takes place
   differently in each worker, justifying the development of strategies to
   group workers with similar learning profiles. This paper proposes a
   framework to form homogeneous groups of workers based on their learning
   profiles by integrating learning curve (LC) modeling and cluster
   analysis. For that, performance data are collected and modeled through
   LCs, such that LC parameters quantify workers' adaptation to tasks.
   Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is applied to the dataset consisting
   of the LC parameters; PCA outputs give rise to an importance index that
   guides a backward parameter selection process. After each LC parameter
   is removed from the dataset, a new grouping using the Fuzzy C-Means
   (FCM) clustering technique is carried out using the remaining LC
   parameters, and the quality of the formed groups is assessed by means of
   three metrics. When applied to a shoe manufacturing process, 8 out of
   the original 29 LC parameters were retained, and used to insert workers
   into two clusters. The reduced subset of parameters elevated the quality
   of the clustering procedure by 29.4\% (from 0.476 to 0.616) according to
   the Silhouette Index; similar improvements were indicated by the other
   two metrics. The retained parameters are related to workers' performance
   at the first repetition and previous experience, highlighting the
   importance of well-designed training programs.},

Abstract = {Lebanon has historically suffered from the effects of devastating
   earthquakes. To successfully mitigate the cataclysmic effects of such
   looming disasters, effective preparatory activities and response
   strategies relying on government resources, community engagement and
   volunteering programs are crucially essential. The objective of this
   study is to assess the willingness of engineering students to join
   earthquake risk reduction programs initiated and led by universities and
   to determine their motives behind such engagements. In addition, the
   study aims to identify the competencies of engineering students in
   supporting response operations when a future earthquake strikes.
   Lebanese senior and graduate engineering students (n = 332) were
   surveyed. The findings revealed a strong tendency for Lebanese
   engineering students to participate in such volunteering programs, and
   that learning and altruistic factors are the leading predictors behind
   the intended participation. However, engineering students showed poor
   competencies and skills that are essentially needed for such a mission.
   This study emphasises the role of universities and engineering
   educational and professional programs in earthquake risk mitigation and
   response operations in future earthquake disasters.},

Title = {Effects of simulation problem-based learning based on Peplau's
   Interpersonal Relationship Model for cesarean section maternity nursing
   on communication skills, communication attitudes and team efficacy},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {113},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: In the coronavirus disease-impacted era, many medical
   institutions have not permitted clinical practice at hospitals or have
   operated their training on a restricted basis. The effective strategy
   for improving therapeutic communication and team cooperation as a
   nursing core competency is required. Objectives: The study aimed to
   verify the effects of simulation problem-based learning on nursing
   students' communication skills, communication attitudes, and team
   efficacy. Design: Non-equivalent control group pretest-posttest design.
   Settings: A university in South Korea. Participants: Nursing students
   who were classified as advanced beginners were randomly allocated to the
   control group (n = 46) or the experimental group (n = 47). Methods: The
   experimental group's students participated in the simulation
   problem-based learning for cesarean section maternity nursing. The
   control group's students participated in a conventional type of
   maternity nursing clinical practice. The communication skills,
   communication attitudes, and team efficacy were measured by using a
   self-reported questionnaire. Results: As compared with the pretest, the
   communication attitudes increased significantly (t = 2.41, p = .020) in
   the posttest for the experimental group. The communication skills (t =
   1.47, p = .150) and team efficacy (F = 3.30, p = .073) were not
   statistically significant. Conclusions: The simulation problem-based
   learning in clinical practice is recommended to improve communication
   attitudes for nursing students and to apply the learned knowledge in
   simulated nursing situations through experiential learning. Future
   research is particularly needed the standardized educational program to
   identify the long-term effects in various cases and settings.},

Title = {Self-directed learning readiness of Indian medical students: a mixed
   method study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUN 8},
Abstract = {Background: Self-directed learning (SDL) is defined as learning on one's
   own initiative, with the learner having primary responsibility for
   planning, implementing, and evaluating the effort. Medical education
   institutions promote SDL, since physicians need to be self-directed
   learners to maintain lifelong learning in the ever-changing world of
   medicine and to obtain essential knowledge for professional growth. The
   purpose of the study was to measure the self-directed learning readiness
   of medical students across the training years, to determine the
   perceptions of students and faculty on factors that promote and deter
   SDL and to identify the role of culture and curriculum on SDL at the
   Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.
   Methods: Guglielmino's SDL Readiness Scale (SDLRS) was administered in
   2015 to six student cohorts (452 students) at admission, end of 1st,
   2nd, 3rd and 4th year of training, and at the beginning of internship in
   the undergraduate medicine (MBBS) program. Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
   was used to compare SDL scores between years of training. 5 student
   focus groups and 7 interviews with instructors captured perceptions of
   self-direction. Transcripts were coded and analyzed thematically.
   Results: The overall mean SDLRS score was 212.91. There was no
   significant effect of gender and age on SDLR scores. There was a
   significant drop in SDLRS scores on comparing students at admission with
   students at subsequent years of training. Qualitative analysis showed
   the prominent role of culture and curriculum on SDL readiness.
   Conclusions: Given the importance of SDL in medicine, the current
   curriculum may require an increase in learning activities that promote
   SDL. Strategies to change the learning environment that facilitates SDL
   have to be considered.},

Title = {Comparison of the perception of the educational atmosphere by nursing
   students in a Chilean university},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {36},
Pages = {452-456},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: Learning is situated within an environment, cannot be
   dissociated from the context in which it occurs and impacts upon the
   results of student learning, obtaining better results in favorably
   perceived environments. The elements that mostly affect that perception
   are the curricular contents, teaching methodologies, and the handling of
   the education atmosphere. These elements, complex and dynamic, are
   perceived differently according to the level of the career. Some studies
   establish that the perception improves as the student progresses in the
   career, while others show the opposite.
   Objectives: Measure the perception of nursing students of the education
   atmosphere and compare the differences among the distinct levels of the
   career.
   Design: This was a longitudinal prospective study.
   Settings and Participants
   The study was conducted with nursing students from the class of 2011 at
   Universidad de los Andes, Santiago-Chile. Sixty-one students complied
   with inclusion criteria and were surveyed in second (n = 55), third (n =
   51), and fourth (n = 34) years, during 2012, 2013, and 2014,
   respectively.
   Methods: The Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure questionnaire
   was applied. The STATA 10 program was used for analysis and the one way
   ANOVA was use to compare the results.
   Results: The average perception of the education atmosphere was 133/200,
   obtaining more positive aspects than negative ones. Students improve
   their perception as they advance in the career. The three measurements
   repeat five items as weaknesses and 12 as strengths.
   Conclusions: It is convenient to bear in mind the difficulties of
   students to reconcile the clinical experiences with the theoretical
   classes on campus by continuous assessing the academic load and the
   demands made by each professor. Some strategies would include promoting
   professors' greater closeness with the students, considering travel
   times in the academic programming, as well as applying the basic
   theoretical contents in real clinical cases to give them relevance. (C)

Title = {Data-driven optimal control of wind turbines using reinforcement

Journal = {COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {176},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We propose a reinforcement learning approach with function approximation
   for maximizing the power output of wind turbines (WTs). The optimal
   control of wind turbines majorly uses the maximum power point tracking
   (MPPT) strategy for sequential decision-making that can be modeled as a
   Markov decision process (MDP). In the literature, the continuous control
   variables are typically discretized to cope with the curse of
   dimensionality in traditional dynamic programming methods. To provide a
   more accurate prediction, we formulate the problem into an MDP with
   continuous state and action spaces by utilizing the function
   approximation in reinforcement learning. The commonly used pitch angle
   is selected as a control variable we are concerned with, which is
   regarded as the system state along with some other controllable and
   uncontrollable variables proven to affect the power output.
   Computational studies of real data are conducted to demonstrate that the
   proposed method outperforms the existing methods in the literature in
   obtaining the optimal power output.},

Title = {Nursing students' experiences of repeating units in an undergraduate
   program: A qualitative study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},

Abstract = {Background: Academic failure in undergraduate nursing education programs
   is a growing concern globally. While some students choose to continue
   with their nursing course by repeating units of study, others
   discontinue from their respective nursing programs contributing to a
   marked increase in nursing attrition rates. This academic failure can be
   attributed to competing demands of paid employment and family
   commitments.
   Aim: The aim of this study was to explore first year students'
   experiences of repeating a unit of study in the undergraduate nursing
   program.
   Methods: A descriptive qualitative design informed this study which
   involved undergraduate nursing students enrolled at a large metropolitan
   multi-campus nursing school in Australia. Data were collected from nine
   nursing students who had repeated one or more units of study using
   face-to-face and telephone interviews and data were analysed used
   thematic analysis.
   Findings: Four themes emerged from the data `struggling to meet workload
   expectations', `making the adjust. ment', `utilising academic supports
   and resources' and `the strength to carry on'. The struggles faced by
   nursing students repeating units of study included the university's
   academic environment, heavy workload and issues encountered to meet
   academic writing standards, juggling to balance the demands of paid
   employment and personal commitments. Participants demonstrated strength
   and resilience in their quest to fulfil their dreams and goals of
   becoming a Registered Nurse, and some reassessed their financial
   situations to make changes to paid employment hours or reduce study
   workload to part-time. While peer support was valued, participants
   expressed their desire for further tutor support to consolidate
   learning.
   Conclusions: Support strategies tailored for students repeating nursing
   units are needed to ensure students continue successfully with their
   nursing programs.},

Title = {The application of the acoustic shadowing facilitates guidance in radial
   artery puncture and cannulation teaching in standardized training for
   residents: a randomized controlled trial},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Background: Radial artery cannulation is a crucial investigative
   procedure for measuring patients' blood pressure invasively and serial
   blood gases. However, radial artery cannulation can be challenging for
   medical residents, and it is necessary to establish a facile and
   straightforward teaching strategy. This study aimed to evaluate the
   efficiency of acoustic shadowing-facilitated ultrasound guidance on
   radial artery cannulation teaching for medical residents.
   Methods: A total of 116 medical postgraduates who underwent standardized
   residency training programs in the Department of Anesthesiology were
   randomly divided into a new ultrasound-guided teaching group and a
   traditional ultrasound-guided teaching group. In the new
   ultrasound-guided teaching group, radial artery puncture technique was
   taught by acoustic shadowing-facilitated ultrasound guidance. The
   training included both theoretical and practical components. After the
   training, the success rate of the first puncture attempt, the success
   rate of the catheterization, the ultrasonic positioning time, and the
   catheterization time of the two groups were compared in a unified
   manner. A questionnaire on the subjective evaluation of the various
   aspects of the program by participants was conducted at the end of the
   training period.
   Results: The study included 101 medical residents. The success rate for
   radial artery puncture at the first attempt in the new ultrasound-guided
   teaching group was 78.43\%. It was significantly higher than that of the
   traditional ultrasound-guided group (58.00\%, odds ratio= 0.380; 95\% CI
   = 0.159 to 0.908; p= 0.027). The success rate for the first arterial
   catheterization in the new ultrasound-guided teaching group was
   significantly higher than that of the traditional ultrasound-guided
   group (74.51\% vs. 52.00\%, odds ratio = 0.371; 95\% CI = 0.160 to
   0.858; p= 0.019). The ultrasonic positioning time and catheterization
   time in minutes in the new ultrasound-guided teaching group were
   significantly shorter than that of the traditional ultrasound-guided
   group (14.36 +/- 3.31 vs. 18.02 +/- 4.95, p< 0.001; 10.43 +/- 2.38 vs.
   14.78 +/- 8.02, p= 0.012). However, no significant differences were
   observed in the incidence of local hematomas and teaching satisfaction
   scores between the two groups.
   Conclusion: Acoustic shadowing facilitates ultrasound-guided radial
   artery puncture and catheterization is beneficial in the standardized
   training and teaching of residents. It improves the success rate of the
   first attempt at radial artery puncture and catheterization and shortens
   the time of ultrasound location and catheterization.},

Abstract = {Extreme learning machine (ELM) is suitable for nonlinear soft sensor
   development. Yet it faces an overfitting problem. To overcome it, this
   work integrates bound optimization theory with variational Bayesian (VB)
   inference to derive novel L1 norm-based ELMs. An L1 term is attached to
   the squared sum cost of prediction errors to formulate an objective
   function. Considering the nonconvexity and nonsmoothness of the
   objective function, this article uses bound optimization theory, and
   constructs a proper surrogate function to equivalently convert a
   challenging L1 norm-based optimization problem into easy one. Then, VB
   inference is adopted for optimizing the converted problem. Thus, an L1
   norm-based ELM can be efficiently optimized by an alternating
   optimization algorithm with a proved convergence. Finally, a soft sensor
   is developed based on the proposed algorithm. An industrial case study
   is carried out to demonstrate that the proposed soft sensor is
   competitive against recent ones.},

Abstract = {Using real-world situations to engage students in learning specific
   content is advocated by educational research as an effective strategy.
   However, motivating students to establish personal and emotional
   connections with the curricular content is challenging. We presented a
   didactic strategy named ``the presidential election of the human
   body,{''} created to use the presidential election context to engage
   students in studying cell function and structure using role-playing and
   appropriation of scientific concepts. Four groups of students (n = 124)
   of the science and mathematics teacher training program chose a cell of
   the human body to impersonate, they studied the biology of their cell,
   and they ran in a presidential election campaign. They created slogans,
   videos, and materials for their campaign, and on the day of the election
   the group of students voted for the best slogan. The didactic strategy
   was capable of stimulating the appropriation of the characteristics of
   the cells they represented. The majority (75\%) of the elected
   candidates represented cells that are linked to the nervous system.
   Musicality and humor were the most frequent styles that appeared in the
   slogans. Students strongly agreed that they enjoyed the activity and
   considered it valuable for contextualizing the learning of anatomy and
   physiology. Thus, the activity is a didactic resource to stimulate the
   students to embrace the content they are learning in the contextualized
   momentum of a presidential election.},

   skills, such as collaboration, needed in the health professions. One
   Health recognizes the interconnected nature of human health to
   ecological and animal systems providing a framework for medical
   educators to create transdisciplinary programs. Medical educators should
   emphasize One Health as a problem solving strategy and create actionable
   classroom objectives via distilling One Health into comprehensible
   concepts. This will foster a collaborative learning atmosphere between
   human and non-human disciplines leading to positive outcomes for both
   the student and teacher. Transdisciplinary education is vital to health
   education and will allow students and teachers to use these concepts in
   every day practice to become innovators of health care.},

Title = {The impact of learning to code on elementary students' writing skills},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {175},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The purpose of this research was to investigate how learning to code,
   using Google's CS First's Storytelling lessons, impacted elementary
   students' writing skills, writing stamina, and perceptions of writing
   abilities. In this mixed methods study, 49 fifth grade students
   participated in Google's CS First's Storytelling lessons focused on
   developing stories through coding during a school district's summer
   program. Fifth grade students (elementary level) completed pre- and
   post-writing assessments to measure 1) overall writing skills, 2)
   development of ideas, writing organization, grammar and usage, and
   mechanics, and 3) writing stamina. After completing the lessons and
   assessments, 10 students participated in a semi-structured interview to
   document perceptions of their writing abilities and engagement in
   writing. The results of this study show there was a significant increase
   in the overall scores on a pre- and post-writing assessment as well as
   writing stamina, and the interviews revealed that students were
   motivated in the storytelling process through narrative writing. The
   findings of this study support the implementation of coding programs as
   a tool for classroom instruction and the promotion of the development of
   writing skills for elementary students.},

Abstract = {An educated citizenry that participates in and contributes to science
   technology engineering and mathematics innovation in the 21st century
   will require broad literacy and skills in computer science (CS). School
   systems will need to give increased attention to opportunities for
   students to engage in computational thinking and ways to promote a
   deeper understanding of how technologies and software are used as design
   tools. However, K-12 students in the United States are facing a broken
   pipeline for CS education. In response to this problem, we have
   developed the Scalable Game Design curriculum based on a strategy to
   integrate CS education into the regular school curriculum. This strategy
   includes opportunities for students to design and program games and
   science technology engineering and mathematics simulations. An approach
   called Computational Thinking Pattern Analysis has been developed to
   measure and correlate computational thinking skills relevant to game
   design and simulations. Results from a study with more than 10,000
   students demonstrate rapid adoption of this curriculum by teachers from
   multiple disciplines, high student motivation, high levels of
   participation by women, and interest regardless of demographic
   background.},

Abstract = {Team-based learning offers an active learning strategy that provides a
   structure for measurement of learning and feedback to the students.
   Aggregating these results provides a longitudinal pattern of student
   performance. In this study, we analyzed results from a sequence of
   assessments related to TBL IRAT and GRAT assessments and traditional
   quizzes in a second-year musculoskeletal course in an undergraduate
   medical education program to determine if there are any measurable
   patterns, or performance trends, that students demonstrate in the
   course. Analyzing results from four academic years, we found evidence
   supporting there is predictability in student?s future week?s
   performance based on past performances across teaching modalities. We
   hypothesize that students are moderating their own effort regarding
   weekly low-stake assessments in prioritizing their academic efforts. The
   results from this study highlight the role of self-efficacy in medical
   education and suggest a new area of research for assessment of student
   performance patterns. Future studies could investigate whether these
   performance patterns are replicated in other assessment modalities and
   whether the same pattern holds for high-stakes assessments.},

Abstract = {Research investigating how the brain develops and learns profoundly
   impacts education. Understanding the brain mechanisms responsible for
   learning and memory and the factors that influence them, such as age,
   environment, emotions, and motivation, can transform educational
   strategies by contributing to the development of programs that optimize
   learning. Including neuroscience education in teachers' training
   requires teaching them a multidisciplinary approach to science, which
   presents a challenge. Furthermore, the potential educational advances
   from the incorporation of neuroscience into teachers' training are
   hindered by significant obstacles such as translating research into the
   classroom; this includes the spread of neuromyths and the products,
   practices, and programs based on them. Our group has 9 years of
   experience in developing courses for training teachers. However, in 2020
   the world faced the COVID-19 pandemic, which imposed on society a new
   way of carrying out its daily activities, including teaching. This study
   reports the experiences of our group as we developed the ninth edition
   of the Neuroscience Applied to Education teachers' training in an online
   format that included synchronous and asynchronous activities. Sixty
   teachers participated in the course. The synchronous meetings lasted 1.5
   h/wk and addressed different themes: neuroscience and education,
   neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, neurobiology of learning and memory,
   factors that interfere with learning, and pedagogical innovation.
   According to the teachers' perceptions, the course was fundamental for
   them in terms of acquiring new knowledge about neuroscience. Everyone
   agreed on the possible applicability of the concepts covered to improve
   their pedagogical practice and teaching environment.
   NEW \& NOTEWORTHY This study reports the experience of developing the
   ninth edition of the Neuroscience Applied to Education course in an
   online format that included synchronous and asynchronous activities.
   Here we show that schoolteachers consider the course important for
   acquiring new knowledge about neuroscience and the applicability of the
   concepts covered to improve their pedagogical practice and teaching
   environment. The online format did not prejudice the experience, and the
   technologies used were well evaluated.},

Abstract = {Federated learning (FL) offers a promising paradigm that empowers
   numerous Internet of Things (IoT) devices to implement distributed
   learning on the premise of ensuring user privacy and data security.
   However, since FL adopts a synchronous distributed training mode, the
   heterogeneity of participating IoT devices and limited communication
   resources make FL encounter serious issues of low training efficiency in
   actual deployment. In this article, we propose an excellent FL policy
   for the heterogeneous IoT-edge FL system to improve distributed training
   efficiency. Specifically, first, by borrowing the idea of clustering, we
   explore an iterative self-organizing data analysis techniques algorithm
   (ISODATA)-based heterogeneous-aware client scheduling strategy to
   alleviate the issue of low training efficiency incurred by the
   heterogeneity of clients. Subsequently, to tackle the challenge of
   limited communication resources in FL, we first analyze the
   characteristics of the optimal resource block allocation solution
   theoretically and then introduce a mixed-integer linear programming
   (MILP)-based strategy to judiciously allocate resource blocks for
   scheduled clients. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that,
   compared with benchmarking strategies, our proposed FL policy can
   achieve up to 55.22\% accuracy improvement in a relaxed time scenario,
   and attain up to 3.62 x acceleration for reaching the specific expected
   accuracy.},

Title = {Genetic programming-based hyper-heuristic approach for solving dynamic
   job shop scheduling problem with extended technical precedence
   constraints},

Abstract = {Extended technical precedence constraints (ETPC) in dynamic job shop
   scheduling problem (DJSP) are the precedence constraints existing
   between different jobs instead of the conventional technical precedence
   constraints existing in the operations of the same job. This paper
   presents the mathematical programming model of the DJSP with ETPC to
   minimize the mean weighted tardiness of the jobs. The mathematical model
   contributes to the solution and modelling of the DJSP with ETPC and it
   is used to solve small-sized problems to optimality. To solve
   industry-sized problems, a constructive heuristic called the dispatching
   rule (DR) is employed. This paper investigates the use of genetic
   programming (GP) as a hyper-heuristic in the automated generation of the
   problem-specific DRs for solving the problem under consideration. The
   genetic programming-based hyper heuristic (GPHH) approach constructs the
   DRs which are learned from the training instances and then verified on
   the test instances by the simulation experiments. To enhance the
   efficiency of the approach when evolving effective DRs to solve the
   problem, the approach is improved with strategies which consist of a
   problem-specific attribute selection for GP and a threshold condition
   mechanism for fitness evaluation. The simulation results verify the
   effectiveness and efficiency of the evolved DRs to the problem under
   consideration by comparing against the existing classical DRs. The
   statistical analysis of the simulation results shows that the evolved
   DRs outperform the selected benchmark DRs on the problem under study.
   The sensitivity analysis also shows that the DRs generated by the GPHH
   approach are robust under different scheduling performance measures.
   Moreover, the effects of the model parameters, including the percentage
   of jobs with ETPC and the machine utilization, on the performance of the
   DRs are investigated.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Clinical research increasingly acknowledges the existence of
   significant procedural variation in surgical practice. This study
   explored surgeons' perspectives regarding the influence of intersurgeon
   procedural variation on the teaching and learning of surgical residents.
   DESIGN AND SETTING: This qualitative study used a grounded theory-based
   analysis of observational and interview data. Observational data were
   collected in 3 tertiary care teaching hospitals in Ontario, Canada.
   Semistructured interviews explored potential procedural variations
   arising during the observations and prompts from an iteratively refined
   guide. Ongoing data analysis refined the theoretical framework and
   informed data collection strategies, as prescribed by the iterative
   nature of grounded theory research.
   PARTICIPANTS: Our sample included 99 hours of observation across 45
   cases with 14 surgeons. Semistructured, audio-recorded interviews (n =
   14) occurred immediately following observational periods.
   RESULTS: Surgeons endorsed the use of intersurgeon procedural variations
   to teach residents about adapting to the complexity of surgical practice
   and the norms of surgical culture. Surgeons suggested that residents'
   efforts to identify thresholds of principle and preference are crucial
   to professional development. Principles that emerged from the study
   included the following: (1) knowing what comes next, (2) choosing the
   right plane, (3) handling tissue appropriately, (4) recognizing the
   abnormal, and (5) making safe progress. Surgeons suggested that learning
   to follow these principles while maintaining key aspects of surgical
   culture, like autonomy and individuality, are important social processes
   in surgical education.
   CONCLUSIONS: Acknowledging intersurgeon variation has important
   implications for curriculum development and workplace-based assessment
   in surgical education. Adapting to intersurgeon procedural variations
   may foster versatility in surgical residents. However, the existence of
   procedural variations and their active use in surgeons' teaching raises
   questions about the lack of attention to this form of complexity in
   current workplace-based assessment strategies. Failure to recognize the
   role of such variations may threaten the implementation of
   competency-based medical education in surgery. ((C) 2015 Association of

Title = {Simulation-based mastery learning compared to standard education for
   discussing diagnostic uncertainty with patients in the emergency
   department: a randomized controlled trial},

Abstract = {Background Diagnostic uncertainty occurs frequently in emergency medical
   care, with more than one-third of patients leaving the emergency
   department (ED) without a clear diagnosis. Despite this frequency, ED
   providers are not adequately trained on how to discuss diagnostic
   uncertainty with these patients, who often leave the ED confused and
   concerned. To address this training need, we developed the Uncertainty
   Communication Education Module (UCEM) to teach physicians how to discuss
   diagnostic uncertainty. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the UCEM in improving physician communications. Methods
   The trial is a multicenter, two-arm randomized controlled trial designed
   to teach communication skills using simulation-based mastery learning
   (SBML). Resident emergency physicians from two training programs will be
   randomly assigned to immediate or delayed receipt of the two-part UCEM
   intervention after completing a baseline standardized patient encounter.
   The two UCEM components are: 1) a web-based interactive module, and 2) a
   smart-phone-based game. Both formats teach and reinforce communication
   skills for patient cases involving diagnostic uncertainty. Following
   baseline testing, participants in the immediate intervention arm will
   complete a remote deliberate practice session via a video platform and
   subsequently return for a second study visit to assess if they have
   achieved mastery. Participants in the delayed intervention arm will
   receive access to UCEM and remote deliberate practice after the second
   study visit. The primary outcome of interest is the proportion of
   residents in the immediate intervention arm who achieve mastery at the
   second study visit. Discussion Patients' understanding of the care they
   received has implications for care quality, safety, and patient
   satisfaction, especially when they are discharged without a definitive
   diagnosis. Developing a patient-centered diagnostic uncertainty
   communication strategy will improve safety of acute care discharges.
   Although use of SBML is a resource intensive educational approach, this
   trial has been deliberately designed to have a low-resource, scalable
   intervention that would allow for widespread dissemination and uptake.},

Title = {The Role of Bisection Class in Guiding Teenagers' Core Values from the
   Perspective of Deep Learning},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {SEP 17},
Abstract = {Effective classrooms(EC) encourage students to participate in
   conversations, investigations, and experiments that help them learn and
   grow. Even in small groups, students are responsible for much of their
   learning. Split classrooms are ones where pupils from two or more grade
   levels are placed in the same classroom. Values taught in the classroom
   may aid students in distinguishing between right and wrong, influencing
   their attitudes and behaviours as adults. Some of the problems are
   students' lack of cooperation, empathy, and support for one another,
   insufficient financing for classroom resources and equipment, and
   students' unable to keep up with education because teachers are held
   more responsible than they should be to increase meaningful academic
   learning and facilitate social and emotional growth. Video editing
   programs provide a more satisfying sensory experience than just reading
   from printed information. Deep learning (DL) allows pupils to think
   critically and successfully collaborate with others in all academic
   areas. Deep learning is a strategy and attitude to learning using
   complex mental talents such as the ability to analyze, create, solve
   issues, and think the state of play to build long-term comprehension.
   Using this method, EC-DL decent employment is becoming more cognitively
   demanding, and advanced skills are essential for students to cope with
   this reality. Due to this programmer, students become interested,
   autonomous learners, and active citizens in a democratic society.
   Classrooms were successful because they incorporated exploratory
   learning through guided inquiry-based activities, which increased
   students' curiosity and encouraged them to develop higher-order thinking
   skills. In-class learning activities must be purposefully designed.
   According to one study, classes positively influenced student learning
   and success.},

Title = {A Multi-Critic Reinforcement Learning Method: An Application to
   Multi-Tank Water Systems},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {173227-173238},
Abstract = {This paper investigates the combination of reinforcement learning and
   neural networks applied to the data-driven control of dynamical systems.
   In particular, we propose a multi-critic actor-critic architecture that
   eases the value function learning task by distributing it into multiple
   neural networks. We also propose a filtered multi-critic approach that
   offers further performance improvements as it eases the training process
   of the control policy. All the studied methods are evaluated with
   several numerical experiments on multi-tank water systems with nonlinear
   coupled dynamics, where control is known to be a challenging task. The
   simulation results show that the proposed multi-critic scheme is able to
   outperform the standard actor-critic approach in terms of speed and
   sensitivity of the learning process. Moreover, the results show that the
   filtered multi-critic strategy outperforms the unfiltered one under
   these same terms. This document highlights the benefits of the
   multi-critic methodology on a state of the art reinforcement learning
   algorithm, the deep deterministic policy gradient, and demonstrates its
   application to multi-tank water systems relevant for industrial process
   control.},

Title = {Resident and program characteristics that impact performance on the
   Ophthalmic Knowledge Assessment Program (OKAP)},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {BackgroundTo determine which resident and program characteristics
   correlate with ophthalmic knowledge, as assessed by resident Ophthalmic
   Knowledge Assessment Program (OKAP) performance.MethodsAn online survey
   was sent in June 2017 to all US ophthalmology residents who took the
   OKAP in April 2017.ResultsThe survey response rate was 13.8\% (192/1387
   residents). The mean respondent age was 30.4years, and 57.3\% were male.
   The mean {[}SD] self-reported 2017 OKAP percentile was 61.9 {[}26.7].
   OKAP performance was found to have a significant positive correlation
   with greater number of hours spent/week studying for the OKAPs
   (p=0.007), with use of online question banks (p<0.001), with review
   sessions and/or lectures arranged by residency programs (p<0.001), and
   with OKAP-specific didactics (p=0.002). On multivariable analysis,
   factors most predictive of residents scoring 75th percentile were,
   higher step 1 scores (OR=2.48, {[}95\% CI: 1.68-3.64, p<0.001]),
   presence of incentives (OR=2.75, {[}95\% CI: 1.16-6.56, p=0.022]),
   greater number of hours/week spent studying (OR=1.09, {[}95\%
   CI:1.01-1.17, p=0.026]) and fewer hours spent in research 3months prior
   to examination (OR=1.08, {[}95\% CI: 1.01-1.15, p=0.020]. Lastly,
   residents less likely to depend on group study sessions as a learning
   method tended to score higher (OR=3.40, {[}95\% CI: 1.16-9.94,
   p=0.026]).ConclusionsPrograms wishing to improve resident OKAP scores
   might consider offering incentives, providing effective access to
   learning content e.g. online question banks, and adjusting the
   curriculum to highlight OKAP material. Step 1 scores may help educators
   identify residents who might be at risk of not performing as well on the
   OKAP.},

Title = {Energy Saving and Interference Coordination in HetNets Using Dynamic
   Programming and CEC},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {71110-71121},
Abstract = {Energy efficiency in cellular networks has gained great relevance due to
   the increasing power supply demands in new generation heterogeneous
   network (HetNet). On the other hand, interference coordination is a key
   aspect in HetNets resource management which directly affects the
   performance and energy consumption. Although these two aspect are
   intertwined, they have been studied separately so far. In this paper, we
   address the joint problem of energy saving and interference coordination
   in HetNets. We formulate the problem as a finite horizon Markov decision
   process (MDP) leveraging two facts: the user traffic demands usually
   follow periodic patterns, and the knowledge and prediction of network
   load is crucial in order to select efficient network configurations.
   Quality of Service (QoS) in the network is defined as the ratio of users
   meeting a requirement specified by the operator, and allows us to
   account for a minimum QoS requirement by including a constraint in the
   formulation of the MDP. To address this MDP, we propose an approximate
   dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm which selects energy efficient
   farsighted configurations with QoS guarantees achieving near optimal
   performance. This ADP algorithm is built upon: 1) the certainty
   equivalent control principle, which simplifies the complexity of the
   MDP, and 2) machine learning techniques: a neural network and a
   polynomial regressor which allow us to predict the QoS and the
   consumption of the network in advance. We evaluate our proposal in a
   LTE-A network simulator following the 3GPP guidelines, and the results
   obtained show that a joint control of the energy saving and interference
   coordination mechanisms results in a notably performance improvement
   compared to a disjoint control, in terms of both energy savings and QoS
   guarantees. Moreover, our proposal has the advantage of being adaptable
   to the operator QoS requirements.},

Title = {Engaging educators in the ideation of scenarios for cross-reality
   game-based learning experiences},
Journal = {MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 AUG 31},
Abstract = {Cross-reality media technology creates alternate reality experiences in
   which the physical and the virtual world are interconnected and
   influence each other through a network of sensors and actuators. Despite
   technological advances, the landscape of cross-reality technology as an
   enabler of alternate reality educational experiences has not been
   explored yet. The technical expertise required to set up and program
   such mixed environments is too high to engage the problem owners (i.e.
   educational experts) in the design process and, hence, user-driven
   innovation remains challenging. In this paper we explore the co-creation
   of cross-reality experiences for educational games. We created a
   no-programming toolkit that provides a visual language and interface
   abstractions to quickly build prototypes of cross-reality interactions.
   The toolkit supports experience prototyping and allows designers to
   coproduce, with educational experts, meaningful scenarios while they
   create, try out and reconfigure their prototypes. We report on a
   workshop with 36 educators where the toolkit was used to ideate
   cross-reality games for education. We discuss use cases of game-based
   learning applications developed by the participants that follow
   different pedagogical strategies and combine different physical and
   virtual spaces and times. We outline implications for the design of
   cross-reality interactions in educational settings that trigger further
   research and technological developments.},

Title = {Educating for adaptive expertise: case examples along the medical
   education continuum},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 21},
Abstract = {Adaptive expertise represents the combination of both efficient
   problem-solving for clinical encounters with known solutions, as well as
   the ability to learn and innovate when faced with a novel challenge.
   Fostering adaptive expertise requires careful approaches to
   instructional design to emphasize deeper, more effortful learning. These
   teaching strategies are time-intensive, effortful, and challenging to
   implement in health professions education curricula. The authors are
   educators whose missions encompass the medical education continuum, from
   undergraduate through to organizational learning. Each has grappled with
   how to promote adaptive expertise development in their context. They
   describe themes drawn from educational experiences at these various
   learner levels to illustrate strategies that may be used to cultivate
   adaptive expertise. At Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, a
   restructuring of the medical school curriculum provided multiple
   opportunities to use specific curricular strategies to foster adaptive
   expertise development. The advantage for students in terms of future
   learning had to be rationalized against assessments that are more
   short-term in nature. In a consortium of emergency medicine residency
   programs, a diversity of instructional approaches was deployed to foster
   adaptive expertise within complex clinical learning environments. Here
   the value of adaptive expertise approaches must be balanced with the
   efficiency imperative in clinical care. At Mayo Clinic, an existing
   continuous professional development program was used to orient the
   entire organization towards an adaptive expertise mindset, with each
   individual making a contribution to the shift. The different contexts
   illustrate both the flexibility of the adaptive expertise
   conceptualization and the need to customize the educational approach to
   the developmental stage of the learner. In particular, an important
   benefit of teaching to adaptive expertise is the opportunity to
   influence individual professional identity formation to ensure that
   clinicians of the future value deeper, more effortful learning
   strategies throughout their careers.},

Title = {Self-efficacy Toward a Healthcare Career Among Minority High School
   Students in a Surgical Pipeline Program: A Mixed Methods Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: While many barriers to healthcare careers exist for URM
   students, a strong sense of self-efficacy may help mitigate these
   obstacles. This study explores how URM high school students describe
   their academic challenges and compares their descriptions across
   self-efficacy scores.
   DESIGN: We conducted a convergent mixed methods study of URM high school
   students. Students completed a validated self-efficacy questionnaire and
   participated in semi-structured focus group interviews to discuss their
   approach to academic challenges, goal setting, and achievement. The
   primary outcome was academic, social, and emotional self-efficacy,
   measured using the Self-Efficacy Questionnaire for Children. We
   separated participants into high and low self-efficacy groups based on
   scores in each domain. Using thematic analysis, we identified and
   compared common themes associated with academic challenges and goal
   setting.
   SETTING: Surgical exposure pipeline program sponsored by Stanford
   University Department of Surgery
   PARTICIPANTS: Low-income, high academic achieving URM high school
   students interested in science, technology, engineering and mathematics,
   and/or healthcare careers.
   RESULTS: Thirty-one high school students completed the focus groups and
   self-efficacy questionnaire. Most students scored in the high
   self-efficacy group for at least one domain: 65\% for academic
   self-efficacy, 56\% for social self-efficacy, and 19\% for emotional
   self-efficacy. Four emergent themes highlighted participants'
   perspectives toward educational success: fulfillment in academic
   challenges, focus on future goals, failing forward, and asking for help.
   Compared to students with low self-efficacy scores, students in the
   high-scoring self-efficacy groups more often discussed strategies and
   concrete behaviors such as the importance of seeking support from
   teachers and peers and learning from failure.
   CONCLUSIONS: Students in high self-efficacy groups were more comfortable
   utilizing approaches that helped them succeed academically. Additional
   efforts are needed to bolster student self-efficacy, particularly in
   students from URM backgrounds, to increase diversity in medical schools.

Abstract = {Machine learning technique is recently opening new opportunities to
   identify the complex shear transfer mechanisms of reinforced concrete
   (RC) beam members. This study employed 1224 shear test specimens to
   train decision tree-based machine learning (ML) programs, by which
   strong correlations between shear capacity of RC beams and key input
   parameters were affirmed. In addition, shear contributions of concrete
   and shear reinforcement (the so-called V-c and V-s) were identified by
   establishing three independent ML models trained under different
   strategies with various combinations of datasets. Detailed parametric
   studies were then conducted by utilizing the well-trained ML models. It
   appeared that the presence of shear reinforcement can make the predicted
   shear contribution from concrete in RC beams larger than the pure shear
   contribution of concrete due to the intervention effect between shear
   reinforcement and concrete. On the other hand, the size effect also
   brought a significant impact on the shear contribution of concrete
   (V-c), whereas, the addition of shear reinforcements can effectively
   mitigate the size effect. It was also found that concrete tends to be
   the primary source of shear resistance when shear span-depth ratio
   a/d<1.0 while shear reinforcements become the primary source of shear
   resistance when a/d>2.0.},

Title = {A Core Components Framework for Evaluating Implementation of

Abstract = {Purpose The rapid adoption of competency-based medical education (CBME)
   provides an unprecedented opportunity to study implementation. Examining
   ``fidelity of implementation{''}-that is, whether CBME is being
   implemented as intended-is hampered, however, by the lack of a common
   framework. This article details the development of such a framework.
   Method A two-step method was used. First, a perspective indicating how
   CBME is intended to bring about change was described. Accordingly, core
   components were identified. Drawing from the literature, the core
   components were organized into a draft framework. Using a modified
   Delphi approach, the second step examined consensus amongst an
   international group of experts in CBME. Results Two different viewpoints
   describing how a CBME program can bring about change were found:
   production and reform. Because the reform model was most consistent with
   the characterization of CBME as a transformative innovation, this
   perspective was used to create a draft framework. Following the Delphi
   process, five core components of CBME curricula were identified: outcome
   competencies, sequenced progression, tailored learning experiences,
   competency-focused instruction, and programmatic assessment. With some
   modification in wording, consensus emerged amongst the panel of
   international experts. Conclusions Typically, implementation evaluation
   relies on the creation of a specific checklist of practices. Given the
   ongoing evolution and complexity of CBME, this work, however, focused on
   identifying core components. Consistent with recent developments in
   program evaluation, where implementation is described as a developmental
   trajectory toward fidelity, identifying core components is presented as
   a fundamental first step toward gaining a more sophisticated
   understanding of implementation.},

Title = {The experience of sessional teachers in nursing: A qualitative study},

Abstract = {Background: Worldwide, there is a growing reliance on sessional teachers
   in universities. This trend is reflected in an undergraduate nursing
   program in a large Australian metropolitan university where a
   significant proportion of contact hours is staffed by sessional
   teachers, yet little is known about what type of support is needed for
   sessional teachers to optimise their capacity to contribute to the
   academic program.
   Objectives: To describe the experiences of sessional teachers in a
   Bachelor of Nursing program in an Australian university. Design: This is
   an exploratory qualitative study; fifteen sessional teachers were
   interviewed using semi-structured questions to explore their experiences
   of teaching. Setting: This study was conducted in a large metropolitan
   school of nursing located on three sites. Participants: A purposive
   sample of 15 sessional teachers was interviewed for this study.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted face to face.
   Thematic analysis was used to identify major themes in the interview
   data and collaborative analysis was undertaken to ensure rigour.
   Results: Findings revealed that sessional teachers enjoyed teaching,
   were committed to their role and viewed their clinical currency as a
   valuable asset for teaching. However, participants also spoke about
   wanting a sense of belonging to the School, with most feeling they were
   ``outsiders{''}. Areas identified for improvement included system and
   process issues, micro teaching and assessment skills, classroom
   management and timely access to resources.
   Conclusion: There is a need to improve sessional teachers' sense of
   belonging and to provide an inclusive structure and culture to optimise
   their capacity to contribute to the academic program. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {The authors sought to understand rewards and challenges of teaching
   third-year medical students in the University of Colorado School of
   Medicine (CUSOM) Denver Health Longitudinal Integrated Clerkship
   (DH-LIC) compared to teaching in rotation-based clerkships (RBCs). The
   authors considered implications for the recruitment and retention of
   faculty in clinical educational programs. Preceptors completed surveys
   at baseline and year-end. Of eligible faculty, 28 of 40 completed both
   baseline and year-end surveys. The majority (85.2\%) of faculty were
   satisfied with the DH-LIC and 85.7\% continued to teach in year-two of
   the program. Faculty reported increased satisfaction from teaching and
   improved teaching and mentoring skills. Faculty familiarity with DH-LIC
   students was significantly higher than with students previously taught
   (p=.004); 89.3\% of faculty knew their DH-LIC student well enough to
   tailor instruction to individual learning needs. Teaching techniques
   utilized at baseline and end of year differed significantly; faculty
   reported asking questions to promote thinking, providing feedback to
   students, and providing students with practice in clinical reasoning
   more frequently in the DH-LIC. Innovative models of education such as
   LICs offer a strategy to recruit and retain excellent, invested faculty
   in outpatient settings.},

Abstract = {The Science Teaching Experience Program-Working in Science Education
   (STEP-WISE) provides teaching experience for postdoctoral scholars
   holding full-time research appointments. Through a combination of
   mentorship, deliberate practice, and feedback, the postdocs learn and
   apply inclusive, evidence-based pedagogies. STEP-WISE is integrated into
   postdocs' demanding schedules and is sustainable for institutions to
   run. Here, we assess the effectiveness of STEP-WISE. We used the
   Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM instruction to
   quantify instructor and student behaviors in 20 STEP-WISE class sessions
   from seven courses designed and taught by postdocs in the program. We
   found that all of the postdocs used student-centered teaching
   strategies. Also, using a design-based research framework, we studied
   the program to identify the salient components of its design. Four
   interconnected key elements contribute to the program's success: 1) two
   training sessions, 2) a precourse meeting with the mentor, 3)
   implementation of active-learning strategies with support, and 4)
   debriefing with the mentor after each class session. STEP-WISE is a
   replicable model to support postdocs seeking training and experience in
   evidence-based teaching practices geared to improving undergraduate
   education and transforming pedagogical practice. We conclude that
   high-impact teaching can be learned early in a career with streamlined
   training and intensive mentoring.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the effects of problem-based learning (PBL) on
   students' academic achievements in studying `Electrochemistry' within a
   course on Analytical Chemistry. The research was of a pretest-posttest
   control group quasi-experimental design and it was conducted with second
   year students in the Chemistry Teaching Program at the Faculty of
   Education at Dokuz Eylul University. The topic was taught with PBL in
   the experimental group and with expository teaching strategies in the
   control group. The `Chemistry achievement test (CAT)' was applied as the
   pre-test and post-test in both groups. Post-test scores from the CAT
   demonstrated that there was a significant difference between the
   academic achievements of the two groups in favour of the experimental
   group (U = 8.500, p < 0.05). After using PBL for a period, eleven
   open-ended questions related to the topic were asked to both groups. The
   results of these questions were categorized and the scores obtained from
   the categories were evaluated using content analysis. The results of the
   scores obtained from the open-ended questions showed that the students
   in the experimental group were able to make statements containing fewer
   misconceptions and also had a better understanding of this topic when
   compared to the students in the control group (U = 2.500, p < 0.05). The
   correlation between the scores in the CAT post-test and the scores
   obtained from the open-ended questions of the experimental and control
   groups was also examined. The Spearman correlation coefficients were
   found to be 0.907 and 0.595 for the experimental and the control group,
   respectively. This finding indicated that there was a positive and very
   high level of statistically significant correlation between the scores
   in the CAT post-test and the scores obtained from the open-ended
   questions of the students in the experimental group. Therefore this
   finding also supports the conclusion that the students in the
   experimental group were better able to understand the topic and its
   structure compared to the students in the control group. At the end of
   the application, the results of semi-structured interviews carried out
   showed that students in the experimental group had positive opinions
   regarding PBL.},

Abstract = {This work aims to develop a novel and practical equation for predicting
   the axial load of rectangular concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST)
   columns based on soft computing techniques. More precisely, a dataset
   containing 880 experimental tests was first collected from the available
   literature for the development of an artificial neural network (ANN)
   model. An optimization strategy was conducted to obtain a final set of
   ANN's architecture as well as its weight and bias parameters. The
   performance of the developed ANN was then compared to current codes (AS,
   EN, AIJ, ACI, AISC, LRFD, and DBJ) and existing empirical equations. The
   accuracy of the present model was found superior to the results obtained
   by others when predicting the axial load of rectangular CFST columns.
   For practical application, an explicit equation and an Excel-based
   Graphical User Interface were derived based on the ANN model. The
   graphical user interface is provided freely for all interested users, to
   support the design, teaching, and interpretation of the axial behavior
   of CFST columns.},

Abstract = {Background: One of the most principal key aims of nursing education is
   to promote nursing students' and nurses' critical thinking. Therefore,
   nursing education needs to develop an appropriate curriculum and use
   effective instructional strategies for critical thinking promotion.
   Flipped classroom is a teaching method which substitutes individual
   learning for group learning in a dynamic, interactive environment where
   the teacher guides students to understand and use concepts.
   Objectives: The present study aimed to compare the effects of
   traditional lecture and flipped classroom on Iranian nursing students'
   critical thinking disposition.
   Methods: This nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest
   quasi-experimental study was done in 2016 on 85 second-year bachelor's
   nursing students who had signed up for the Musculoskeletal
   Medical-Surgical Nursing theoretical training course. Because of their
   large number, students had been divided at the beginning of the first
   semester of their four-year program into two 42- and 43-student groups
   and attended separate theoretical training classes. These two classes
   were randomly allocated to either a traditional lecture or a flipped
   classroom group. The instructional strategies in these groups were the
   traditional lecture and the flipped class strategies, respectively. A
   demographic questionnaire and Ricketts' Critical Thinking Disposition
   Inventory were used for data collection.
   Results: After the intervention, the mean scores of critical thinking
   disposition and its engagement domain in the flipped class group were
   significantly higher than the traditional lecture group (P < 0.0001).
   Conclusions: This study shows the positive effects of flipped classroom
   on nursing students' critical thinking disposition. It is recommended
   that future studies assess the effects of flipped classroom on other
   nursing education outcomes.},

Abstract = {Motivation: Large-scale gene expression profiling has been widely used
   to characterize cellular states in response to various disease
   conditions, genetic perturbations, etc. Although the cost of
   whole-genome expression profiles has been dropping steadily, generating
   a compendium of expression profiling over thousands of samples is still
   very expensive. Recognizing that gene expressions are often highly
   correlated, researchers from the NIH LINCS program have developed a
   cost-effective strategy of profiling only similar to 1000 carefully
   selected landmark genes and relying on computational methods to infer
   the expression of remaining target genes. However, the computational
   approach adopted by the LINCS program is currently based on linear
   regression (LR), limiting its accuracy since it does not capture complex
   nonlinear relationship between expressions of genes.
   Results: We present a deep learning method (abbreviated as D-GEX) to
   infer the expression of target genes from the expression of landmark
   genes. We used the microarray-based Gene Expression Omnibus dataset,
   consisting of 111K expression profiles, to train our model and compare
   its performance to those from other methods. In terms of mean absolute
   error averaged across all genes, deep learning significantly outperforms
   LR with 15.33\% relative improvement. A gene-wise comparative analysis
   shows that deep learning achieves lower error than LR in 99.97\% of the
   target genes. We also tested the performance of our learned model on an
   independent RNA-Seq-based GTEx dataset, which consists of 2921
   expression profiles. Deep learning still outperforms LR with 6.57\%
   relative improvement, and achieves lower error in 81.31\% of the target
   genes.},

Abstract = {The reinforcement learning-based prescribed performance optimal tracking
   control prob-lem is considered for a class of strict-feedback nonlinear
   systems in this paper. The unknown nonlinearities and cost function are
   approximated by radial-basis-function (RBF) neural network (NN). The
   overall controller consists of an adaptive controller and an optimal
   compensation term. Firstly, the adaptive controller is designed by
   backstepping control method. Subsequently, the optimal compensation term
   is derived via policy itera-tion by minimizing cost function. In
   addition, depending on the prescribed performance control, the tracking
   error can be limited in the prescribed area. Therefore, the whole
   con-trol scheme can effectively guarantee that the tracking error
   converges to a bound with prescribed performance while the cost function
   is minimized. The stability analysis shows that all signals in the
   closed-loop system are bounded. Finally, the effectiveness and
   advan-tages of the designed control strategy are illustrated by the
   simulation examples.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A time- and cost-effective strategy aimed at increasing awareness of
   diversity, equity, inclusion, respect (DEIR), safety, and other issues
   within a typical graduate program is described. Using a brief portion of
   time (up to similar to 10 min) at the commencement of each weekly
   departmental colloquium event, graduate students under faculty guidance
   develop topics of interest related to the above areas to deliver what
   are deemed to be Safety, Inclusivity, \& Diversity Talks, ({''}SID
   Talks{''}); one SID Talk is delivered at each seminar gathering.
   Importantly, as described herein, this is a student-engaged process and
   is not a graduate program requirement. SID Talks are intended to
   increase and facilitate collegial conversations on topics leading,
   ultimately, to a departmental culture and climate change regarding
   safety awareness and DEIR. SID Talks are easily adaptable to any
   departmental need or situation and have had a positive impact on our
   program as evidenced by increased overall graduate student awareness of
   issues, volunteerism, and a stated desire to learn more on certain
   topics. When surveyed, it was determined that a majority of graduate
   students found SID Talks to be a meaningful addition to our program;
   this attitude is also held by the faculty of the department. The
   development of the SID Talk concept and its integration into our program
   and departmental culture is described along with an assessment of its
   impact and future possibilities.},

Title = {Evaluation of the Impact of School Garden Exposure on Youth Outlook and
   Behaviors toward Vegetables in Southern Arizona},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SCHOOL HEALTH},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND Our objective was to evaluate the effect of garden-based
   learning on outlook and behaviors toward vegetables among primarily
   Latinx students. An educational strategy, garden-based learning is a
   teaching tool that complements other disciplines.
   METHODS Third- and fourth-grade students at 4 elementary schools with
   different garden programs completed a bingo survey and participated in
   class discussions to measure outlook and behaviors toward vegetables.
   RESULTS Students in schools with more garden exposure were more likely
   to answer ``Yes{''} to survey questions reflecting a positive attitude
   and behaviors toward vegetables. In class discussions, students most
   often mentioned vegetables grown in the school garden as their favorite
   vegetables.
   CONCLUSION For third- and fourth-grade students, the length of exposure
   to a school garden appears to have a positive impact on both perceptions
   of and desire to consume vegetables. Other studies have shown that
   positive outlook and behaviors toward vegetables can change vegetable
   consumption habits in children. Integrating garden-based learning into
   the school curriculum may positively influence eating behaviors over the
   long-term future.},

Abstract = {Sensory data have becoming widely available in large volume and variety
   due to the increasing presence and adoption of the Internet of Things.
   Such data can be tremendously useful if they are processed properly in a
   timely fashion. They could play a key role in the coordination of
   industrial production. It is thus desirable to explore an effective and
   efficient scheme to support data tracking and monitoring. This paper
   intends to propose a novel automatic learning scheme to improve the
   tracking efficiency while maintaining or improving the data tracking
   accuracy. A core strategy in the proposed scheme is the design of
   Laguerre neural network (LaNN)-based approximate dynamic programming
   (ADP). As a traditional optimal learning strategy, ADP is a popular
   approach for data processing. The action neural network (NN) and the
   critic NN as two important components in ADP have big impact on the
   performance of ADP. In this paper, a LaNN is employed as the
   implementation of the action NN in ADP considering Laguerre polynomials'
   approximation capability. In addition, this LaNN-based ADP is integrated
   into an online parameter-tuning framework to optimize those parameters
   of characteristic model that is used to trace the data in the tracking
   control system. Meanwhile, this article provides an associated Lyapunov
   convergence analysis to guarantee a uniformly ultimately boundedness
   property for tracking errors in the proposed approach. Furthermore, the
   proposed LaNN-based ADP optimal online parameter-tuning scheme is
   validated using a temperature dynamic tracking control task. The
   simulation results demonstrate that the scheme has satisfactory learning
   performance over time.},

Title = {Predicting Entrepreneurial Intention of Students: An Extreme Learning
   Machine With Gaussian Barebone Harris Hawks Optimizer},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {76841-76855},
Abstract = {This study aims to propose an effective intelligent model for predicting
   entrepreneurial intention, which can provide a reasonable reference for
   the formulation of talent training programs and the guidance of
   entrepreneurial intention of students. The prediction model is mainly
   based on the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) optimized by the
   improved Harris hawk's optimizer (HHO). In order to obtain better
   parameters and feature subsets, the Gaussian barebone (GB) strategy is
   introduced to improve the HHO algorithm, so as to strengthen the
   optimization ability for tuning parameters of KELM and identifying the
   compact feature subsets. Then, an optimal KELM model (GBHHO-KELM) is
   established according to the obtained optimal parameters and feature
   subsets to predict the entrepreneurial intention of students. In the
   experiment, GBHHO is compared with the other nine well-known methods in
   30 CEC 2014 benchmark problems. The experimental findings suggest that
   the proposed GBHHO method is significantly superior to the existing
   methods in most problems. At the same time, GBHHO-KELM is compared with
   other machine learning methods in the prediction of entrepreneurial
   intention. The experimental results indicate that the proposed
   GBHHO-KELM can achieve better classification performance and higher
   stability in accordance with the four metrics. Therefore, we can
   conclude that the GBHHO-KELM model is expected to be an effective tool
   for the prediction of entrepreneurial intention.},

Abstract = {Motivation: Residue-residue contacts are of great value for protein
   structure prediction, since contact information, especially from those
   long-range residue pairs, can significantly reduce the complexity of
   conformational sampling for protein structure prediction in practice.
   Despite progresses in the past decade on protein targets with abundant
   homologous sequences, accurate contact prediction for proteins with
   limited sequence information is still far from satisfaction.
   Methodologies for these hard targets still need further improvement.
   Results: We presented a computational program DeepConPred, which
   includes a pipeline of two novel deep-learning-based methods (DeepCCon
   and DeepRCon) as well as a contact refinement step, to improve the
   prediction of long-range residue contacts from primary sequences. When
   compared with previous prediction approaches, our framework employed an
   effective scheme to identify optimal and important features for contact
   prediction, and was only trained with coevolutionary information derived
   from a limited number of homologous sequences to ensure robustness and
   usefulness for hard targets. Independent tests showed that
   59.33\%/49.97\%, 64.39\%/54.01\% and 70.00\%/59.81\% of the top L/5, top
   L/10 and top 5 predictions were correct for CASP10/CASP11 proteins,
   respectively. In general, our algorithm ranked as one of the best
   methods for CASP targets.},

Title = {Retail Electricity Pricing Strategy via an Artificial Neural
   Network-Based Demand Response Model of an Energy Storage System},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {13440-13450},
Abstract = {The distribution company (DISCO) determines optimal retail prices to
   operate the distribution network efficiently while promoting demand
   response (DR) programs. In addition, an energy storage system (ESS),
   which improves peak load management, is widely used for price-based DR.
   This paper proposes an electricity retail pricing strategy that
   considers the optimal operation of an ESS using a machine learning
   algorithm. An artificial neural network (ANN) is used to develop a
   practical model of the DR scheduling of an ESS. This model is trained
   using historical data that include the electricity price and the
   corresponding optimal demand obtained from the building energy
   management system. The proposed model is replicated using mathematical
   equations and directly integrated into the constraints of the retail
   pricing optimization problem of the distribution management system. The
   proposed ANN-based DR model of the ESS allows the development of an
   optimal pricing strategy with a single-level structure while reflecting
   the decision-making process of both the DISCO and the building operator.
   The proposed ANN-based DR model is verified through case studies, which
   prove that the model successfully expresses the price-optimal demand
   function and has high practical applicability. The results of the retail
   pricing demonstrate that the proposed strategy can accurately determine
   the balancing points while reducing the peak load.},

Abstract = {Since the introduction of betting exchanges in 2000, there has been
   increased interest of ways to monetize on the new technology. Betting
   exchange markets are fairly similar to the financial markets in terms of
   their operation. Due to the lower market share and newer technology,
   there are very few tools available for automated trading for betting
   exchanges. The in-depth analysis of features available in commercial
   software demonstrates that there is no commercial software that natively
   supports machine learned strategy development. Furthermore, previously
   published academic software products are not publicly obtainable. Hence,
   this work concentrates on developing a full-stack solution from data
   capture, back-testing to automated Strategy Agent development for
   betting exchanges. Moreover, work also explores ways to forecast price
   movements within betting exchange using new machine learned trading
   strategies based on Artificial Neuron Networks (ANN) and Cartesian
   Genetic Programming (CGP). Automatically generated strategies can then
   be deployed on a server and require no human interaction. Data explored
   in this work were captured from 1st of January 2016 to 17th of May 2016
   for all GB WIN Horse Racing markets (total of 204 GB of data
   processing). Best found Strategy agent shows promising 83\% Return on
   Investment (ROI) during simulated historical validation period of one
   month (15th of April 2016 to 16th of May 2016). (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {TBEM: Testing-Based GPU-Memory Consumption Estimation for Deep Learning},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {39674-39680},
Abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) has been successfully implemented and deployed to
   various software service applications. During the training process of
   DL, a large amount of GPU computing resources is required, but it is
   difficult for developers to accurately calculate the GPU resources that
   the model may consume before running, which brings great inconvenience
   to the development of DL systems. Especially in today's cloud-based
   model training. Therefore, it is very important to estimate the GPU
   memory resources that the DL model may use in a certain computing
   framework. Existing work has focused on static analysis methods to
   assess GPU memory consumption, highly coupled with the framework, and
   lack of research on low-coupled GPU memory consumption of the framework.
   In this article, we propose TBEM, which is a test-based method for
   estimating the memory usage of the DL model. First, TBEM generates
   enough DL models using an orthogonal array testing strategy and a
   classical neural network design pattern. Then, TBEM generates DL model
   tested in a real environment to obtain the real-time GPU memory usage
   values corresponding to the model. After obtaining the data of different
   models and corresponding GPU usage values, the data is analyzed by
   regression.},

Title = {Exploring the affective, motivational and cognitive effects of
   pedagogical agent enthusiasm in a multimedia learning environment},
Journal = {HUMAN-CENTRIC COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAY 5},
Abstract = {In a traditional classroom environment, instructor enthusiasm has been
   shown to enhance student's emotion, affective perceptions, intrinsic
   motivation, and cognitive outcome. Additionally, emotional response
   theory argues that enthusiastic verbal and nonverbal cues of an
   instructor will induce positive emotional states in learners, which in
   turn, enact learners' approach behaviours in the learning process.
   Therefore, should a pedagogical agent convey enthusiastic behaviours in
   a multimedia learning environment? Literature and theoretical reviews
   offer two competing views. The first view, based on emotional response
   theory, predicts that enthusiastic verbal and nonverbal cues of a
   pedagogical agent can induce higher positive emotions in learners, which
   in turn, enhance affective perceptions, intrinsic motivation, and
   cognitive outcome. However, the second view, based on cognitive load
   theory, suggests that pedagogical agent enthusiasm may increase
   extraneous cognitive load (additional processing in the mind), which
   negatively impact emotion, affective perceptions, intrinsic motivation,
   and cognitive outcome. To investigate the effects of agent enthusiasm,
   seventy-two university freshmen interacted with either an enthusiastic
   agent or a neutral agent (operationalized through vocal tones, facial
   expression, gestures, and remarks) that simulates the instructional role
   of a virtual tutor that delivers narrative demonstrations on how to
   predict the outputs of C-Programming algorithms. The results of our
   study showed that pedagogical agent enthusiasm significantly enhanced
   emotion, intrinsic motivation, affective perceptions, and cognitive
   outcome. Moreover, mediation analyses revealed that the facilitating
   effects of agent enthusiasm on intrinsic motivation, affective
   perceptions of the learning environment, and affective perceptions of
   the pedagogical agent were fully mediated by a learner's positive
   emotion, thus demonstrating that the framework of emotional response
   theory can be applied to learner-agent interaction in a multimedia
   learning environment. Implications and suggestions for future research
   related to pedagogical agent enthusiasm are discussed in this paper.},

Title = {Observer based adaptive dynamic programming for fault tolerant control
   of a class of nonlinear systems},
Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {384},
Pages = {21-33},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper develops a novel fault tolerant control (FTC) scheme for a
   class of nonlinear systems with actuator failures based on adaptive
   dynamic programming (ADP). The estimated actuator failure from a fault
   observer is utilized to construct an improved performance index function
   that reflects the failure, regulation and control simultaneously. By
   employing a proper performance index function, the FTC problem can be
   transformed into an optimal control problem. By using policy iteration,
   the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation can be solved by constructing a
   critic neural network. Then, the approximated optimal controller can be
   derived directly. The closed-loop system is guaranteed to be uniformly
   ultimately bounded via the Lyapunov stability theorem. The effectiveness
   of the developed FTC scheme is demonstrated by two simulation examples.
   The significant contribution of the proposed strategy lies in that the
   well-known ADP method is extended to solving the FTC problem. (C) 2016

Title = {Students together with academics ensures retention and success: The
   STARS project},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {97},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background: Approximately 23\% of Australian undergraduate students who
   commenced a degree in 2018 will not complete their program of study. Of
   these students, approximately 25\% cite their `study is too hard' or
   `too much' when withdrawing from their degree. Research has identified
   that the most common group of students to struggle with completing their
   program of study are those from equity groups.
   Objectives: This paper explores a support strategy aimed at improving
   the first-year student experience and progression rates.
   Design: A proof of concept project was undertaken to explore
   undergraduate midwifery students' experiences of an Expectation Led
   Planned Organisational teaching strategy into a course.
   Settings: The study was undertaken at two sites of a regional University
   in New South Wales, Australia.
   Participants: All students (n42) enrolled in a core course, in the first
   year of a Bachelor of Midwifery program.
   Methods: A mixed methods approach was used. Quantitative data was
   collected through the university's program and course management systems
   and analysed using descriptive statistics to find patterns. Qualitative
   data were collected via a focus group to provide greater knowledge of
   the acceptability of the strategy and analysed using content analysis.
   Results: The inclusion of sequenced email reminders for upcoming
   assessment tasks was valued by students. There were greater retention
   and progression rates and a shift in the grade distribution towards
   higher course grades overall. Student satisfaction with learning
   activities increased along with course assessment satisfaction.
   Conclusion: Student engagement in learning is enhanced and retention and
   success rates are increased when academics use technology in a student
   focused manner. Further research is required to further explore and
   evaluate strategies that are student focused and acceptable as well as
   sustainable for the higher education context.},

Abstract = {PI3K alpha is a promising drug target for cancer chemotherapy. In this
   paper, we report a strategy of combing ligand-based and structure-based
   virtual screening to identify new PI3K alpha inhibitors. First, na < ve
   Bayesian (NB) learning models and a 3D-QSAR pharmacophore model were
   built based upon known PI3K alpha inhibitors. Then, the SPECS library
   was screened by the best NB model. This resulted in virtual hits, which
   were validated by matching the structures against the pharmacophore
   models. The pharmacophore matched hits were then docked into PI3K alpha
   crystal structures to form ligand-receptor complexes, which are further
   validated by the Glide-XP program to result in structural validated
   hits. The structural validated hits were examined by PI3K alpha
   inhibitory assay. With this screening protocol, ten PI3K alpha
   inhibitors with new scaffolds were discovered with IC50 values ranging
   0.44-31.25 mu M. The binding affinities for the most active compounds 33
   and 74 were estimated through molecular dynamics simulations and MM-PBSA
   analyses.

Title = {Leadership Development for Future Medical School Deans: Outcomes of the
   AAMC Council of Deans Fellowship Program},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {95},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1887-1892},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Purpose
   To determine the outcomes of the Association of American Medical
   Colleges (AAMC) Council of Deans (COD) Fellowship Program with respect
   to participants' achieving the goals of becoming a medical school dean
   and developing leadership skills, and to ascertain fellows' views about
   the program's value, beneficial aspects, and areas for improvement.
   Method
   The 37 COD fellows from 2002 to 2016 were invited to participate in a
   2017 survey addressing demographics, training, current leadership
   position, and value of the program. The survey also included 3
   open-ended questions. A 2018 web-based search was conducted to determine
   fellows' senior leadership roles since their program participation.
   Results
   The survey response rate was 73\% (27/37). The majority of respondents
   were male (82\%, 22), aged 51-70 (89\%, 25), and white (82\%, 22). The
   top 5 medical specialties reported were internal medicine, pediatrics,
   anesthesiology, psychiatry, and surgery. Most respondents (63\%, 17)
   reported having a graduate degree. All reported being in leadership
   positions in academia and/or health care. The web-based search found
   that 27\% (10/37) of the fellows became medical school deans (average
   tenure 5.6 years); 2 fellows became deans of other types of schools.
   Overall, survey respondents perceived the program as valuable.
   Respondents identified shadowing a dean mentor, attending COD meetings,
   and attending the AAMC Executive Development Seminar for Deans as the
   most valuable program components. The majority (88\%, 23/26) indicated
   their fellow experience persuaded them to pursue being a dean; 2 (8\%)
   indicated it did not. Respondents identified 4 key opportunities for
   program improvement: more sponsorship by deans, development of a
   learning community, enhanced mentoring, and coaching.
   Conclusions
   The COD Fellowship Program appears to be successful in preparing senior
   faculty to become deans and assume other senior leadership roles in
   academia and/or health care. Fellows' feedback will be used to inform
   future revisions to the program.},

Journal = {PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE},

Month = {MAY 14},
Abstract = {Cervical cancer remains a significant cause of mortality all around the
   world, even if it can be prevented and cured by removing affected
   tissues in early stages. Providing universal and efficient access to
   cervical screening programs is a challenge that requires identifying
   vulnerable individuals in the population, among other steps. In this
   work, we present a computationally automated strategy for predicting the
   outcome of the patient biopsy, given risk patterns from individual
   medical records. We propose a machine learning technique that allows a
   joint and fully supervised optimization of dimensionality reduction and
   classification models. We also build a model able to highlight relevant
   properties in the low dimensional space, to ease the classification of
   patients. We instantiated the proposed approach with deep learning
   architectures, and achieved accurate prediction results (top area under
   the curve AUC = 0.6875) which outperform previously developed methods,
   such as denoising autoencoders. Additionally, we explored some clinical
   findings from the embedding spaces, and we validated them through the
   medical literature, making them reliable for physicians and biomedical
   researchers.},

Abstract = {Background: Preparing nursing students for making the transition to
   graduate nurse is crucial for entry into practice. Final year student
   nurses at the National University of Singapore (NUS) are required to
   undergo a consolidated clinical practice to prepare them for their
   transition to graduate nurse.
   Aim: To describe the development, implementation and evaluation of a
   simulation program known as SIMulated Professional Learning Environment
   (SIMPLE) in preparing the final year student nurses for their clinical
   practicum in transition to graduate nurse practice.
   Method: A set of simulation features and best practices were used as
   conceptual framework to develop and implement the simulation program. 94
   final year student nurses participated in the 15-hour SIMPLE program
   that incorporated multiple simulation scenarios based on actual ward
   clinical practices. Pre and post-tests were conducted to assess the
   students' preparedness for their clinical practice in transition to
   graduate nurse practice. The students also completed a satisfaction
   questionnaire and open questions to evaluate their simulation
   experiences.
   Results: The student nurses demonstrated a significant improvement (t =
   12.06, p < 0.01) on post-test score (mean = 117.21, SD = 15.17) from
   pre-test score (mean = 97.86, SD = 15.08) for their perceived
   preparedness towards their clinical practicum in transition to graduate
   nurse practice. They were highly satisfied with their simulation
   learning. Themes emerged from the comments on the most valuable aspects
   of the SIMPLE program and ways to improve the program.
   Conclusion: The study provided evidences on the effectiveness of the
   SIMPLE program in enhancing the students' preparedness for their
   transition to graduate nurse practice. A key success of the SIMPLE
   program was the used of simulation strategy and the involvement of
   practicing nurses that closely linked the students with the realities of
   current nursing practice to prepare them for the role of staff nurses.

Title = {An Active Learning Didactic Proposal with Human-Computer Interaction in
   Engineering Education: A Direct Current Motor Case Study},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Engineering education requires learning strategies to engage students
   and improve the development of disciplinary and transversal
   competencies. Additionally, as economic resources are generally limited,
   it is sought to avoid investing large sums of money in software and
   hardware, as well as in fitting out laboratories. This work presents a
   didactic proposal within the framework of active and collaborative
   learning that includes the flipped classroom technique to be applied in
   the curriculum of undergraduate engineering programs and inside a
   massive flexible digital master class. The activity is the mathematical
   modeling, simulation, and control system of a direct current motor where
   simulation work is carried out in open license computational packages.
   Students understand the physical phenomena involved in the motor's
   modeling and the input-output variables' relations. Moreover, an analogy
   between an electromechanical and a pure electrical model is carried out,
   where the relevant variables respond in an agile and reliable manner. To
   validate the modeling, the differential equations are solved by applying
   numerical methods, and tested for control purposes. The activity has
   been validated with a rule-based system applied to a Likert scale survey
   data. This type of human-computer interaction, in the context of active
   learning, could engage students and motivate them to develop
   competencies that are highly appreciated by industry practitioners.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine students' health-related
   fitness knowledge (HRFK) and physical activity levels after the
   implementation of a series of fitness lessons segments called Knowledge
   in Action (KIA). KIA aims to teach health-related fitness knowledge
   (HRFK) during short episodes of the physical education lesson. Teacher
   participants from one district (N = 10) were randomly assigned into
   either the intervention or comparison group. Intervention teachers used
   the KIA fitness lessons during fifth grade students' physical education
   classes. These teachers received training sessions, teaching materials,
   and YouTube videos that modeled the KIA fitness lessons. Intervention
   fidelity was assessed through observations and a fidelity checklist.
   Students' physical activity levels were measured using accelerometers
   and HRFK was examined by PE Metrics 28-question pencil and paper test.
   General linear models (GLM) and Hierarchical linear models (HLM) were
   used to examine group differences. Intervention students had a 3.4
   (20\%) greater unit improvement in HRFK scores when compared with their
   comparison counterparts (p < .001), at the school level. Student
   activity levels of moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) time were
   similar in both groups (p = .64). Teachers can use the KIA fitness
   lesson segments or similar strategies to effectively teach HRFK in
   elementary physical education classes.},

Journal = {ELECTRONICS},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Easy JavaScript Simulations (EJsS) is an open-source tool that allows
   teachers with limited programming experience to straightforwardly bundle
   an interactive computer science or engineer simulation in an HTML+
   JavaScript webpage. Its prominent place in Physics (where it has won
   several prizes) should not hinder its application in other fields (such
   as building the front-end of remote laboratories or learning analytics)
   after having adapted part of the functionality of EJsS to them. To
   facilitate the future inclusion of new functionalities in EJsS, this
   paper presents a new version of this tool that allows the enhancement of
   EJsS, letting it incorporate new tools and change its graphical user
   interface, by means of extension plugins (special software libraries).
   To illustrate the benefits of this distributable self-contained
   non-intrusive strategy, the paper (a) discusses the new methodological
   possibilities that the Plugins bring to EJsS developers and users, and
   (b) presents three plugins: one to support the plugin management and the
   others to easily set up a streamlined remote laboratory. Moreover, the
   paper also presents the main characteristics of that remote lab to allow
   readers take advantage of EJsS and the three plugins to set up new
   online experiments for their students quickly.},

Title = {Examination of the topic-specific nature of pedagogical content

Journal = {CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {658-674},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine experienced chemistry teachers'
   pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) for two different topics in
   chemistry to better understand how PCK is specific to topic, including
   whether all components of PCK are topic-specific and to what degree. To
   explore the topic-specific nature of PCK, we examined two experienced
   teachers' PCK using a case study methodology. Multiple data collection
   strategies were used, including a card-sorting activity, Content
   Representation (CoRe), semi-structured interviews, observations, and
   field notes. The data collected were analyzed both deductively and
   inductively. Results revealed that the teachers used more content-based
   and teacher-centered instruction to teach electrochemistry, whereas
   their instruction was less teacher-centered, and included
   Science-Technology-Society-Environment discussions and implicit NOS
   instruction to teach nuclear reactions. The teachers also varied in the
   extent of their knowledge of learners and curriculum in comparing their
   PCK for each topic. In regard to assessment, the teachers' assessment
   practices were at the general PK level; they lacked topic-specific PCK
   for either topic. We provided recommendations for professional
   development programs, pre-service teacher education programs, and
   curriculum developers to support teachers in developing topic-specific
   PCK.},

Title = {Supervising international students in clinical placements: perceptions
   of experiences and factors influencing competency development},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Month = {JUL 16},
Abstract = {Background: Health professional education programs attract students from
   around the world and clinical supervisors frequently report that
   international students find learning in clinical placement contexts
   particularly challenging. In existing literature clinical supervisors,
   who support international students on placement have identified concerns
   about their communication and interactions within clinical environments.
   However, clinical supervisors' perspectives about their experiences with
   international students on placement and the strategies they utilise to
   facilitate international student learning have not been described. As a
   result we have little insight into the nature of these concerns and what
   clinical supervisors do to support international students' competency
   development.
   Methods: Five focus group interviews were conducted with twenty
   Speech-Language Pathology clinical supervisors, recruited from 2
   Australian universities. Interview data were analysed thematically.
   Themes identified were interpreted using cognitive load and
   sociocultural learning theories to enhance understanding of the
   findings.
   Results: Four themes were identified: `Complex teaching and learning
   relationships', `Conceptions of students as learners'; Student
   communication skills for professional practice', and `Positive mutual
   learning relationships'.
   Conclusions: Findings indicated that clinical supervisors felt positive
   about supporting international students in clinical placements and
   experienced mutual learning benefits. However, they also identified
   factors inherent to international students and the placement environment
   that added to workload, and made facilitating student learning complex.
   Clinical supervisors described strategies they used to support
   international students' cultural adjustment and learning, but
   communication skills were reported to be difficult to facilitate within
   the constraints of placements. Future research should address the urgent
   need to develop and test strategies for improving international
   students' learning in clinical settings.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has swiftly forced a change in learning strategies
   across educational institutions, from extensively relying on in-person
   activities toward online teaching. It is particularly difficult to adapt
   courses that depend on physical equipment to be now carried out
   remotely. This is the case for bioinformatics, which typically requires
   dedicated computer classrooms, as the logistics of granting remote
   access to a workstation or relying on the computational resources of
   each student is not trivial. A possible workaround is using cloud
   server-based computing resources, such as Google Colaboratory, a free
   web browser application that allows the writing and execution of Python
   programming through Jupyter notebooks, integrating text, images, and
   code cells. Following a cloud-based approach, we migrated the practical
   activities of a course on molecular modeling and simulation into the
   Google Colaboratory environment resulting in 12 tutorials that introduce
   students to topics such as phylogenetic analysis, molecular modeling,
   molecular docking, several flavors of molecular dynamics, and
   coevolutionary analysis. Each of these notebooks includes a brief
   introduction to the topic, software installation, execution of the
   required tools, and analysis of results, with each step properly
   described. Using a Likert scale questionnaire, a pool of students
   positively evaluated these tutorials in terms of the time required for
   their completion, their ability to understand the content and exercises
   developed in each session, and the practical significance and impact
   that these computational tools have on scientific research. All
   tutorials are freely available at https: //github.com/pb3lab/ibm3202.},

Abstract = {The advancements of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies
   have provided us unprecedented opportunities to characterize cellular
   states and investigate the mechanisms of complex diseases. Due to
   technical issues such as dropout events, scRNA-seq data contains excess
   of false zero counts, which has a substantial impact on the downstream
   analyses. Although several computational approaches have been proposed
   to impute dropout events in scRNA-seq data, there is no strong consensus
   on which is the best approach. In this study, we propose a novel
   weighted ensemble learning method, named EnTSSR, to impute dropout
   events in scRNA-seq data. By using a multi-view two-side sparse
   self-representation framework, our model can exploit the consensus
   similarities between genes and between cells based on the imputed
   results of various imputation methods. Moreover, we introduce a weighted
   ensemble strategy to leverage the information captured by various
   imputation methods effectively. Down-sampling experiments, clustering
   analysis, differential expression analysis and cell trajectory inference
   are carried out to evaluate the performance of our proposed model.
   Experiment results demonstrate that our EnTSSR can effectively recover
   the true expression pattern of scRNA-seq data.},

Abstract = {Phenomenon: Fatigue is a significant risk factor for deterioration in
   performance, which may lead to medical errors and reduced well-being in
   resident physicians (residents). Sleep deprivation, which has been
   studied extensively, is only one contributor to fatigue. Given the
   complexity of fatigue and its relationship with resident performance,
   the National Steering Committee on Resident Duty Hours in Canada
   recommends that all residency education programs develop a fatigue risk
   management plan (FRMP) for their residents. The purpose of this study
   was to explore the impact of residents' experiences of fatigue and the
   strategies they use to manage it. Approach: This single-site study
   investigated the perceptions of resident physicians. Residents were
   recruited through purposive sampling to ensure representation from a
   variety of programs, postgraduate year level, and gender. Recruitment
   was managed with support from the residency programs; however, data
   collection and analysis were conducted by the Office of Postgraduate
   Medical Education to ensure participant anonymity. Program directors and
   administrators assisted in relaying the information about the study to
   the residents; however, they were not made aware if their residents
   participated in the study. Interview and focus group data were collected
   all at once, then transcribed, and then subsequent thematic analysis of
   these data was conducted using a quasi-constant comparison approach
   until thematic saturation was reached. Two researchers coded the data
   using thematic content analysis. Findings: Fifty-seven residents
   participated in a focus group or interview. There was representation
   from more than half of the 58 residency programs and from 15 of 16
   departments. Overall, there was consensus that fatigue impacts
   residents' physical, cognitive, and emotional states. These impacts were
   reported as influencing resident performance including those related to
   patient care. Residents reported that fatigue led them to be less
   productive in their personal and professional lives. Three major themes
   were identified for which strategies could be developed for fatigue risk
   management: self, program, and system. Together with self-, program-,
   and system-level strategies that complement and enhance each other,
   specific targeted FRMPs could be developed. Insights: Fatigue is a
   multifaceted phenomenon experienced by residents that requires
   management beyond extended duty hours and adequate amounts of sleep.
   FRMPs that encompass strategies used by the resident, the
   residency-training program, and the healthcare system in which they work
   could assist with managing fatigue in residents and support enhanced
   resident well-being and patient care.},

Abstract = {In operation of active electric distribution networks, optimal
   configuration and schedule of distributed generation and reactive power
   resources are determined. This represents a formidable multi-modal
   constrained optimisation problem with discrete decision variables.
   Metaheuristics are the most common approaches for solving this problem.
   However, due to its multi-modal nature, metaheuristics commonly converge
   prematurely into local optima and cannot find near-global solutions. In
   this research, a new particle swarm optimisation (PSO) variant is put
   forward for finding optimal configuration and schedule of distributed
   generation and reactive power resources in distribution systems
   including both dispatchable and renewable distributed energy resources.
   In the proposed PSO variant, opposition-based learning concept is
   incorporated into PSO which reduces premature convergence probability
   through enhancement of swarm leaders. The results of the proposed
   opposition-based PSO in IEEE 69 bus system indicate its outperformance
   over conventional PSO, time-varying acceleration coefficient PSO,
   fractal optimisation algorithm and evolutionary programming.},

Title = {Introductory Engineering Decision-Making: Guiding First-Year Students to
   Relativism in Software Design},

Abstract = {Contribution: A semester-long, open-ended design project was implemented
   to promote intellectual development of first-year students while
   reinforcing event-driven/procedural programming principles. This paper
   describes this approach, and an evaluation strategy using Perry's model
   for intellectual development. The results show that students can reach
   the relativism stage of Perry's model in their first year of studies.
   Background: Students must move beyond a dualistic worldview to be
   engineers. Felder and Brent provided a list of recommendations to
   promote this type of intellectual development in students; active
   learning strategies strongly align with these recommendations. While
   active learning is common in programming courses (sometimes taking the
   form of project-based learning), they are typically tightly controlled
   by the instructor, and limited in scope (both in time and complexity),
   potentially reducing their impact on students.
   Intended Outcomes: This course and term-long project provided students a
   supportive environment in which to develop their decision-making skills,
   and promoted their intellectual development through Perry's stages
   related to software design.
   Application Design: Aligned with Felder and Brent's recommendations and
   Kuh's High Impact Practices, a course was built to: 1) teach students
   procedural programming, with 2) a focus on software design and
   open-ended problem solving, while maintaining 3) a supportive
   environment for skill acquisition.
   Findings: A mixed methods study showed the majority of students align
   themselves with the relativism stage of intellectual development at the
   end of the course. This study also illuminated the decision-making
   processes of teams of students in a first-year software design course.},

Title = {Graph neural network-based resource allocation strategies for
   multi-object spectroscopy},
Journal = {MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Resource allocation problems are often approached with linear
   programming techniques. But many concrete allocation problems in the
   experimental and observational sciences cannot or should not be
   expressed in the form of linear objective functions. Even if the
   objective is linear, its parameters may not be known beforehand because
   they depend on the results of the experiment for which the allocation is
   to be determined. To address these challenges, we present a bipartite
   graph neural network (GNN) architecture for trainable resource
   allocation strategies. Items of value and constraints form the two sets
   of graph nodes, which are connected by edges corresponding to possible
   allocations. The GNN is trained on simulations or past problem
   occurrences to maximize any user-supplied, scientifically motivated
   objective function, augmented by an infeasibility penalty. The amount of
   feasibility violation can be tuned in relation to any available slack in
   the system. We apply this method to optimize the astronomical target
   selection strategy for the highly multiplexed Subaru Prime Focus
   Spectrograph instrument, where it shows superior results to direct
   gradient descent optimization and extends the capabilities of the
   currently employed solver which uses linear objective functions. The
   development of this method enables fast adjustment and deployment of
   allocation strategies, statistical analyses of allocation patterns, and
   fully differentiable, science-driven solutions for resource allocation
   problems.},

   Based on Reinforcement Learning},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {Network function virtualization (NFV) makes the realization of specific
   network functions no longer depend on inherent hardware by executing
   virtual network functions (VNFs), but realizes network functions in a
   more flexible programming manner, thereby reducing the pressure of
   resource allocation on the underlying network. Service function chain
   (SFC) is composed of a set of fixed order VNFs. These VNFs need to be
   deployed on appropriate physical nodes to meet user function
   requirements, i.e., the placement of SFC. Traditional solutions mostly
   use mathematical models or heuristic methods, which are not applicable
   in the context of large-scale networks. Secondly, the existing methods
   do not integrate intelligent learning algorithms into the service
   function chain placement (SFCP) problem, which limits the possibility of
   obtaining better solutions. This paper presents a multi-objective
   optimization service function chain placement (MOO-SFCP) algorithm based
   on reinforcement learning (RL). The goal of the algorithm is to optimize
   the resource allocation mode, including several performance indexes such
   as underlying resource consumption revenue, revenue cost ratio, VNF
   acceptance rate and network latency. We model the SFCP as a Markov
   decision process (MDP), and use a two-layer policy network as an
   intelligent agent. In the training stage of RL, the agent
   comprehensively considers the optimization objectives and formulates the
   optimal physical node mapping strategy for VNF requests. In the test
   phase, the whole SFCP is completed according to the trained node mapping
   strategy. Simulation results show that the algorithm proposed in this
   paper has excellent performance in the aspects of underlying resource
   allocation revenue, VNF acceptance rate and so on. In addition, we prove
   that the algorithm has good flexibility by changing the delay
   constraint.},

Title = {Reinforcement learning for robust adaptive control of partially unknown
   nonlinear systems subject to unmatched uncertainties},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a novel robust adaptive control strategy for
   partially unknown continuous-time nonlinear systems subject to unmatched
   uncertainties. Initially, the robust nonlinear control problem is
   converted into a nonlinear optimal control problem by constructing an
   appropriate value function for the auxiliary system. After that, within
   the framework of reinforcement learning, an identifier-critic
   architecture is developed. The presented architecture uses two neural
   networks: the identifier neural network (INN) which aims at estimating
   the unknown internal dynamics and the critic neural network (CNN) which
   tends to derive the approximate solution of the Hamilton-jacobi-Bellman
   equation arising in the obtained optimal control problem. The INN is
   updated by using both the back-propagation algorithm and the
   e-modification technique. Meanwhile, the CNN is updated via the modified
   gradient descent method, which uses historical and current state data
   simultaneously. Based on the classic Lyapunov technique, all the signals
   in the closed-loop auxiliary system are proved to be uniformly
   ultimately bounded. Moreover, the original system is kept asymptotically
   stable under the obtained approximate optimal control. Finally, two
   illustrative examples, including the F-16 aircraft plant, are provided
   to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method. (C) 2018

Title = {Role of community health service programs in navigating the medical
   ethical slippery slope-a 10-year retrospective study among medical
   students from southern China},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {BackgroundFor promoting autonomous learning motivation, the learning
   effect of community-oriented service is beneficial, because through
   community participation and service, students can transfer their
   implicit cognition of ethics into explicit cognition, leading to the
   cultivation of a sympathetic partnership between the community and
   medical students. Despite the proven benefits of medical students'
   community health service (CHS) in Western countries, CHS programs
   designed for medical students are not well established in mainland
   China, and their effects on medical students' ethical cognition are
   largely unknown. This study evaluated the effects of CHS programs on the
   ethical cognition of medical students.MethodsA cross-sectional study was
   conducted on third- and fourth-year medical students and graduates
   working at Shantou University Medical College by using a
   self-administered anonymous questionnaire. Through interviews, we
   applied a thematic approach to analyze the responses of the
   participating students. The questionnaire adopted in this study was
   revised based on a review of the literature on medical ethics in medical
   students and on the CHS environment in China. The reviewed
   questionnaires included an evaluation questionnaire on cultivating
   medical ethics in a CHS context, and questionnaires used to explore the
   cultivation and transformation of medical ethics in medical students
   during the preclinical period.ResultsA total of 361 (54.4\%)
   undergraduate medical students and 302 (45.6\%) graduates participated
   in this survey. Significant differences were observed in self-evaluation
   of the cognitive development of ethics between those who had
   participated in CHS programs 1-5 times and those who had participated >6
   times. The successful identification of accepting money from the
   patients under the table as unethical behavior significantly differed
   (p=.031) among the graduates but not (p=.567) among the undergraduate
   students. The participants expressed the positive impact of CHS programs
   on their self-development.ConclusionCHS programs can be widely applied
   in medical education in China. This educational strategy, which supports
   medical professionalism and incorporates humanitarian behavior as a
   complement to learning, should be encouraged and promoted nationally.},

   Networks Using Deep Reinforcement Learning},

Abstract = {The requirements for powerful computing capability, high capacity, low
   latency and low energy consumption of emerging services, pose severe
   challenges to the fifth-generation (5G) network. As a promising
   paradigm, mobile edge networks can provide services in proximity to
   users by deploying computing components and cache at the edge, which can
   effectively decrease service delay. However, the coexistence of
   heterogeneous services and the sharing of limited resources lead to the
   competition between various services for multiple resources. This paper
   considers two typical heterogeneous services: computing services and
   content delivery services, in order to properly configure resources, it
   is crucial to develop an effective offloading and caching strategies.
   Considering the high energy consumption of 5G base stations, this paper
   considers the hybrid energy supply model of traditional power grid and
   green energy. Therefore, it is necessary to design a reasonable
   association mechanism which can allocate more service load to base
   stations rich in green energy to improve the utilization of green
   energy. This paper formed the joint optimization problem of computing
   offloading, caching and resource allocation for heterogeneous services
   with the objective of minimizing the on-grid power consumption under the
   constraints of limited resources and QoS guarantee. Since the joint
   optimization problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem
   that is impossible to solve, this paper uses deep reinforcement learning
   method to learn the optimal strategy through a lot of training.
   Extensive simulation experiments show that compared with other schemes,
   the proposed scheme can allocate resources to heterogeneous service
   according to the green energy distribution which can effectively reduce
   the traditional energy consumption.},

   curriculum for Family Medicine Residency},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Background Medical assistance in dying (MAID) became legal across Canada
   when Bill C-14 was passed in 2016. Currently, little is known about the
   most effective strategies for providing MAID education, and the
   importance of integrating MAID into existing curricula. In this study, a
   set of learning objectives (LOs) was developed to inform a foundational
   MAID curriculum in Canadian Family Medicine (FM) residency training
   programs. Methods Mixed methods were used to develop LOs based on a
   published needs assessment from a large, four-site family medicine
   residency program in southeastern Ontario. Draft LOs were evaluated and
   revised by faculty and resident leaders using a modified Delphi process
   and a focus group. LOs were mapped to the existing family medicine
   residency curriculum, as well as the College of Family Physicians of
   Canada's Priority Topics. Results Nine LOs were developed to provide a
   foundational education regarding MAID. While all LOs could be mapped to
   the Domains of Clinical Care within the departmental curriculum, they
   mapped inconsistently to departmental Entrustable Professional
   Activities and the Priority Topics. LOs focused on patient education and
   identification of patient goals were most readily mapped to existing
   curricular framework, while LOs with MAID-exclusive content revealed
   gaps in the current curriculum. Conclusions The developed LOs provide a
   guide to ensure family medicine residents obtain generalist-level
   knowledge to counsel their patients about MAID. These LOs can serve as a
   model for developing LOs for both family medicine and specialist
   residency programs in Canada and in countries where MAID is legal.},

Title = {Are preprofessional undergraduate students ready for authentic clinical
   case studies? An empirical study of students? perceived relevance and
   motivation},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {47},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Increasingly, the curricula of many clinical programs have been
   restructured to an integrated model in which foundational sciences such
   as physiology, pathophysiology, and pharmacology are taught side by side
   with clinical reasoning. Case studies are an excellent pedagogical
   strategy for enhancing such integration, especially if such cases are
   authentic, that is, they include a broad range of information that could
   influence the individualization and optimization of patient care.
   However, authentic cases may be too advanced and thereby dissuade
   preclinical students. We offered an optional semester-long authentic
   pharmacotherapy case study to undergraduate students in an introductory
   pharmacology class in a liberal arts college in the United States
   Midwest and sought to know what might motivate students to complete this
   challenging task. Connection with and relevance of the case study were
   assessed with an anonymous survey. Open-ended questions were analyzed
   qualitatively. Exploratory factor analysis and nonmetric
   multidimensional scaling were employed to investigate underlying
   commonalities and patterns in the motivations for participating in and
   relating to the case study. Students were motivated more by the
   perceived relevance and transferability of knowledge acquired to their
   future career than by their current clinical technician jobs or their
   personal lives. Rather than causing an information overload and
   dissuading students, this complex pharmacotherapy case assignment
   harnessed preclinical students' experiences from cognate cocurricular
   activities, created numerous points of relevant engagement with
   instructional content, and therefore motivated students to deeper
   learning. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Early introduction to clinical reasoning is
   widely advocated. Case studies are frequently used to enhance
   integration of foundational sciences with clinical reasoning.
   Preclinical students may be overwhelmed by complex cases because of the
   higher-order cognitive tasks involved. We find that complex cases permit
   connection with students' own experiences and aspirations. These
   preclinical students were motivated to engage in such challenging
   academic work because of the perceived transferability of knowledge to
   their future careers.},

Abstract = {The ongoing adoption of competency-based medical education (CBME) across
   health professions training draws focus to learner-centred educational
   design and the importance of fostering a growth mindset in learners,
   teachers, and educational programs. An emerging body of literature
   addresses the instructional practices and features of learning
   environments that foster the skills and strategies necessary for
   trainees to be partners in their own learning and progression to
   competence and to develop skills for lifelong learning. Aligned with
   this emerging area is an interest in Dweck's self theory and the concept
   of the growth mindset. The growth mindset is an implicit belief held by
   an individual that intelligence and abilities are changeable, rather
   than fixed and immutable. In this paper, we present an overview of the
   growth mindset and how it aligns with the goals of CBME. We describe the
   challenges associated with shifting away from the fixed mindset of most
   traditional medical education assumptions and practices and discuss
   potential solutions and strategies at the individual, relational, and
   systems levels. Finally, we present future directions for research to
   better understand the growth mindset in the context of CBME.},

Abstract = {Background: There are international concerns relating to the management
   of patient deterioration. The ``failure to rescue{''} literature
   identifies that nursing staff miss cues of deterioration and often fail
   to call for assistance. Simulation-based educational approaches may
   improve nurses' recognition and management of patient deterioration.
   Objectives: To investigate the educational impact of the First2Act
   web-based (WB) and face-to-face (F2F) simulation programs.
   Design \& Setting: A mixed methods interventional cohort trial with
   nursing staff from four Australian hospitals.
   Participants: Nursing staff working in four public and private hospital
   medical wards in the State of Victoria.
   Methods: In 2016, ward nursing staff (n = 74) from a public and private
   hospital completed three F2F laboratory-based team simulations with a
   patient actor in teams of three. 56 nursing staff from another public
   and private hospital individually completed a three-scenario WB
   simulation program (First2ActWeb) {[}A 91\% participation rate].
   Validated tools were used to measure knowledge (multi-choice
   questionnaire), competence (check-list of actions) and confidence
   (self-rated) before and after the intervention.
   Results: Both WB and F2F participants' knowledge, competence and
   confidence increased significantly after training (p <= 0.001). Skill
   performance for the WB group increased significantly from 61\% to 74\%
   (p <= 0.05) and correlated significantly with post-test knowledge (p =
   0.014). No change was seen in the F2F groups' performance scores. Course
   evaluations were positive with median ratings of 4/5 (WB) and 5/5 (F2F).
   The F2F program received significantly more positive evaluations than
   the WB program (p < 0.05), particularly with regard to quality of
   feedback.
   Conclusion: WB and F2F simulation are effective education strategies
   with both programs demonstrating positive learning outcomes. WB programs
   increase ease of access to training whilst F2F enable the development of
   tactile hands on skills and teamwork. A combined blended learning
   education strategy is recommended to enhance competence and patient
   safety.},

Title = {The effect of structured empathy education on empathy competency of
   undergraduate nursing interns: A quasi-experimental study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {85},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background: Empathy is a crucial element in fostering a positive
   relationship between nurses and patients. Recent research indicates that
   the degree of empathy in nursing students declines as they gain
   education or experience. A number of teaching strategies have been used
   to improve nursing students' empathy competence levels. However, little
   is currently known about how empathy is best taught or enhanced in
   senior nursing students in China.
   Objectives: To implement a structured empathy educational program as
   developed from the Delphi technique, as well as to evaluate its effects
   on empathy competence among undergraduate nursing interns.
   Design: This study is quasi-experimental, with two-group comparison.
   Participants: Undergraduate nursing students in their fourth year (n =
   118) were recruited from an affiliated teaching hospital in Wuhan,
   Central Part of China, between January 2018 and March 2018.
   Methods: A convenience sample of 118 undergraduate nursing interns were
   recruited from a teaching hospital in Wuhan and assigned to either the
   intervention or the control group according to their preference.
   Participants in the intervention group had received a 2-week, 12-hour
   structured empathy-related educational program (two sessions per week, 3
   h per session), whereas the control group received no intervention. The
   Jefferson Scale of Empathy-Health Providers (JSE-HPs) was used to assess
   students' empathy levels before and after the intervention.
   Results: An independent samples t-test revealed that scores of empathy
   competence levels in the intervention group were significantly higher
   than those in the control group following the intervention. Three
   domains of empathy competence level were also significantly higher in
   the intervention group after the two weeks' training relative to the
   control group, namely: perspective taking, compassionate care, and
   standing in the patient's shoes.
   Conclusions: This modified empathy educational program may prove
   beneficial in improving the empathy competence level of undergraduate
   nursing interns.},

Abstract = {It is common to think of learning as the acquisition of knowledge by an
   individual learner. Starting a century ago, Lev Vygotsky developed a
   different perspective on learning, initiating a tradition of educational
   research whose momentum and influence continue to grow. One of
   Vygotsky's key principles is the general genetic law of cultural
   development that states that whatever skilled cognition that individuals
   carry out within their own minds is preceded by homologous activity
   carried out by a social group of which this individual was a part. In
   linking the individual and society through this law, learning is not
   simply a matter of the acquisition of domain knowledge. Rather, it is a
   cyclic process by which a social group, in its functioning through joint
   activity, leads to individuals taking into themselves (i.e.,
   internalizing) the social forms of activity. In this article, our goal
   is to explicate Vygotsky's genetic law and demonstrate its utility for
   yielding novel insight into computing education. We provide an extended
   illustration of the use of Vygotsky's law in examining a teacher and
   students in a university setting write code together during a class
   session. What our analysis reveals is that the teacher and students
   together enact a sequential, rule-based, and dialogical process of
   problem decomposition and code writing far different from the plan and
   schema-based models for programming that have emerged from prior
   research focused on the individual student and their cognitive
   strategies and structures. We provide commentary on implications of the
   genetic law for both research and practice in computing education.},

Title = {Training hospital managers for strategic planning and management: a
   prospective study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},

Abstract = {Background: Training is the systematic acquisition of skills, rules,
   concepts, or attitudes and is one of the most important components in
   any organization's strategy. There is increasing demand for formal and
   informal training programs especially for physicians in leadership
   positions. This study determined the learning outcomes after a specific
   training program for hospital management teams.
   Methods: The study was conducted during 2006 and 2007 at the Centre
   School of Public Health and Management, Faculty of Medicine, University
   of Belgrade and included 107 participants involved in the management in
   20 Serbian general hospitals. The management teams were
   multidisciplinary, consisting of five members on average: the director
   of the general hospital, the deputy directors, the head nurse, and the
   chiefs of support services. The managers attended a training program,
   which comprised four modules addressing specific topics. Three reviewers
   independently evaluated the level of management skills at the beginning
   and 12 months after the training program. Principal component analysis
   and subsequent stepwise multiple linear regression analysis were
   performed to determine predictors of learning outcomes.
   Results: The quality of the SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities
   and threats) analyses performed by the trainees improved with
   differences between 0.35 and 0.49 on a Likert scale (p < 0.001).
   Principal component analysis explained 81\% of the variance affecting
   their quality of strategic planning. Following the training program, the
   external environment, strategic positioning, and quality of care were
   predictors of learning outcomes. The four regression models used showed
   that the training program had positive effects (p < 0.001) on the
   ability to formulate a Strategic Plan comprising the hospital mission,
   vision, strategic objectives, and action plan.
   Conclusion: This study provided evidence that training for strategic
   planning and management enhanced the strategic decision-making of
   hospital management teams, which is a requirement for hospitals in an
   increasingly competitive, complex and challenging context. For the first
   time, half of state general hospitals involved in team training have
   formulated the development of an official strategic plan. The positive
   effects of the formal training program justify additional investment in
   future education and training.},

Title = {Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Decision Making and
   Motion Planning of Intelligent Vehicles},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {209776-209789},
Abstract = {Autonomous decision making and motion planning in complex dynamic
   traffic environments, such as left-turn without traffic signals and
   multi-lane merging from side-ways, are still challenging tasks for
   intelligent vehicles. It is difficult to generate optimized behavior
   decisions while considering the motion capabilities and dynamic
   properties of intelligent vehicles. Aiming at the above problems, this
   article proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach for
   autonomous decision making and motion planning in complex dynamic
   traffic scenarios. The proposed approach consists of two layers. At the
   higher layer, a kernel-based least-squares policy iteration algorithm
   with uneven sampling and pooling strategy (USP-KLSPI) is presented for
   solving the decision-making problems. The motion capabilities of the ego
   vehicle and the surrounding vehicles are evaluated with a high-fidelity
   dynamic model in the decision-making layer. By doing so, the consistency
   between the decisions generated at the higher layer and the operations
   in the lower planning layer can be well guaranteed. The lower layer
   addresses the motion-planning problem in the lateral direction using a
   dual heuristic programming (DHP) algorithm learned in a batch-mode
   manner, while the velocity profile in the longitudinal direction is
   inherited from the higher layer. Extensive simulations are conducted in
   complex traffic conditions including left-turn without traffic signals
   and multi-lane merging from side-ways scenarios. The results demonstrate
   the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach in realizing
   optimized decision making and motion planning in complex environments.},

Title = {A Machine-Learning Based Approach for Predicting Older Adults? Adherence
   to Technology-Based Cognitive Training},
Journal = {INFORMATION PROCESSING \& MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {Adequate adherence is a necessary condition for success with any
   intervention, including for computerized cognitive training designed to
   mitigate age-related cognitive decline. Tailored prompting systems offer
   promise for promoting adherence and facilitating intervention success.
   However, developing adherence support systems capable of just-in-time
   adaptive reminders re-quires understanding the factors that predict
   adherence, particularly an imminent adherence lapse. In this study we
   built machine learning models to predict participants' adherence at
   different levels (overall and weekly) using data collected from a
   previous cognitive training intervention. We then built machine learning
   models to predict adherence using a variety of baseline measures
   (demographic, attitudinal, and cognitive ability variables), as well as
   deep learning models to predict the next week's adherence using
   variables derived from training in-teractions in the previous week.
   Logistic regression models with selected baseline variables were able to
   predict overall adherence with moderate accuracy (AUROC: 0.71), while
   some recurrent neural network models were able to predict weekly
   adherence with high accuracy (AUROC: 0.84-0.86) based on daily
   interactions. Analysis of the post hoc explanation of machine learning
   models revealed that general self-efficacy, objective memory measures,
   and technology self-efficacy were most predictive of participants'
   overall adherence, while time of training, ses-sions played, and game
   outcomes were predictive of the next week's adherence. Machine-learning
   based approaches revealed that both individual difference
   characteristics and previous inter-vention interactions provide useful
   information for predicting adherence, and these insights can provide
   initial clues as to who to target with adherence support strategies and
   when to provide support. This information will inform the development of
   a technology-based, just-in-time adherence support systems.},

Title = {Mobile sensor-based community gaming for improving vocational students'
   sleep and academic outcomes},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Quality sleep is critical for teenagers' physical and mental health and,
   consequently, learning achievement. Technology, particularly the use of
   mobile sensors and digital game-based learning, has the potential to
   enhance students' sleep hygiene, reducing insomnia and daytime
   sleepiness and improving students' academic performance. Therefore, this
   study implemented and evaluated a sleep hygiene instruction intervention
   in terms of three elements: a) mobile sleep sensor data feedback for
   sleep self-evaluation; b) a collaborative-competitive mobile community
   game (MCG) for sleep promotion based on social-interdependence; and c)
   an instructional intervention adopting a social cognitive approach. To
   validate the efficacy of the instructional design, a pretest-posttest
   quasi-experiment was conducted with 114 10th grade students from three
   classes of an urban vocational high school in Taiwan. The three intact
   classes were randomly assigned to one of three sleep hygiene courses: a
   comparison group (37 students receiving sleep sensor feedback),
   experimental group one (E1; 38 students receiving sleep sensor feedback
   and adopting MCG), and experimental group two (E2; 39 students receiving
   sleep sensor feedback, adopting MCG, and taking a social cognitive-based
   course). The empirical results suggest that the use of sleep sensor
   feedback and the MCG (E1 and E2) effectively improved the sleep
   behaviors of vocational students. In fact, inclusion of the mobile
   sensor with feedback on sleep quality was sufficient to provide
   improvement in both sleep and academic outcomes for all students. These
   results demonstrate the promising potential of mobile community-based
   technological interventions for improving sleep hygiene, relieving
   insomnia daytime sleepiness, when integrated with either traditional or
   social cognitive-based sleep courses. Specific implications and
   recommendations for the development of technology-enhanced sleep-related
   or health promotion courses are provided.},

Title = {Optimal Operation of Hydropower System by Improved Grey Wolf Optimizer
   Based on Elite Mutation and Quasi-Oppositional Learning},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Abstract = {As one of the most important renewable energy, hydropower is often asked
   to satisfy the load demand of power system at peak periods. Thus, the
   optimal operation of hydropower system is modelled to minimize the
   standard deviation of the residual load series obtained by subtracting
   the total power outputs of all the involved hydropower plants from the
   original load curve. Hence, this paper develops an improved grey wolf
   optimizer (IGWO) to effectively address the complex constrained
   optimization problem. In the proposed method, the quasi-oppositional
   learning is used to enhance the convergence rate of the swarm; the elite
   mutation operator is used to increase the probability of escaping from
   local optima; the elastic-ball strategy and heuristic constraint
   handling method are used to help infeasible individuals rebound to
   feasible space. Numerical experiments of 12 classical test functions
   demonstrate the feasibility of the IGWO method in the global
   optimization problems. Then, the developed method is applied to solve
   the optimal operation of two cascade hydropower systems. The results
   indicate that the proposed method outperforms several traditional
   methods in smoothing the peak loads of power system. To sum up, an
   effective solution tool is provided for the hydropower system operation
   optimization problem.},

Abstract = {Medical educators are in a continuous quest to close the gap between the
   needs of medical practice and the rising expectations of the communities
   in their countries. During the past two decades, competency-based
   medical education has been evolving as an appealing strategy to close
   this gap. In 2017, the Egyptian medical education authorities mandated
   all medical schools to change their curricula to comply with revised
   national academic reference standards, which changed from outcome-based
   to competency-based. In parallel, they also changed the timeline of all
   medical programs for six years of studentship and one-year internship to
   five years and two years, respectively. This substantial reform involved
   the assessment of the existing situation, an awareness campaign for the
   proposed changes and an extensive national faculty development program.
   Monitoring the implementation of this substantial reform was performed
   through surveys, field visits and meetings with students, teaching staff
   and program directors. In addition to the expected challenges, the
   COVID-19-associated restrictions presented a significant further
   challenge during the implementation of this reform. This article
   presents the rationale for and steps of this reform, the challenges
   faced and how they were addressed.},

Abstract = {Objective. To identify the specific study behaviors that promoted
   student pharmacists' success in an active-learning pharmacy curriculum.
   Methods. The Washington State University College of Pharmacy and
   Pharmaceutical Sciences implemented an active-learning, flipped
   classroom model for instruction to equitably deliver course content to
   Doctor of Pharmacy students on both its main and extended campuses.
   Students' ability to adapt to the new model and its impact on their
   study behaviors were unknown. A qualitative descriptive design that
   included semi-structured interviews was applied to evaluate the study
   behaviors of high-performing students. The study sample included 13
   third and fourth professional year pharmacy students in the top 20\% of
   their respective classes.
   Results. Interview responses were unaffected by baseline demographics
   such as gender and year of graduation. Content analysis generated five
   primary themes related to the behavioral strategies used by high
   performers: preparing for class, preparing for testing, seeking help,
   knowing yourself, and building on strengths. These were mapped to the
   four tenants of Wenger's social learning theory in the representation of
   findings: learning as doing, learning as belonging, learning as
   becoming, and learning as experience.
   Conclusion. High-performing students demonstrated a refined ability to
   select and modify study behaviors that aided in their academic success,
   demonstrating a high degree of metacognition. The results of this
   research may assist pharmacy faculty members in identifying critical
   elements for success of students enrolled in pharmacy programs using an
   active learning model.},

Title = {Comparison of simulation-based interprofessional education and
   video-enhanced interprofessional education in improving the learning
   outcomes of medical and nursing students: A quasi-experimental study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {118},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Use of interprofessional education has greatly expanded and
   is widely used to foster interprofes-sional collaborative practice
   competency in health professionals, especially during medical
   emergencies. Iden-tifying the interprofessional education delivery mode
   that can maximize learning outcomes within available resources is
   crucial for achieving the sustainability of an interprofessional
   education program.Objectives: To examine the learning outcomes of
   simulation-based interprofessional education and video -enhanced
   interactive discussion interprofessional education modules and to
   analyze the variable costs be-tween these two interprofessional
   education modules.Design: A prospective quasi-experimental study.
   Setting: A medical university in Northern Taiwan. Participants: 24
   medical students and 48 nursing students enrolled in a 4-week
   simulation-based interprofessional education or video-enhanced
   interactive discussion interprofessional education program.Methods:
   Students' medical task performance, critical medical task performance,
   team behavior performance, and interprofessional collaboration attitude
   were examined at the pretest and posttest by using an objective
   structured checklist and team performance rating scale with a hands-on
   simulation model and structured questionnaires. The variable costs for
   simulation-based interprofessional education and video-enhanced
   inter-active discussion interprofessional education were estimated upon
   the completion of the course. Results: All learning outcomes
   significantly improved for both the groups from the pretest to posttest.
   After the intervention, the simulation-based interprofessional education
   group exhibited significantly higher scores in medical task performance,
   critical medical task performance and team behavior performance than the
   video -enhanced interactive discussion interprofessional education group
   at the posttest. No significant difference was noted in
   interprofessional collaboration attitude between the groups. Cost
   analysis revealed that the simulation-based interprofessional education
   program was approximately two times more expensive in terms of staffing
   costs and required 1.3 times greater space charges than the
   video-enhanced interactive discussion interprofessional education
   program.Conclusion: Both simulation-based interprofessional education
   and video-enhanced interactive discussion inter -professional education
   modules effectively improved medical and nursing students' medical task
   performance, critical medical task performance and team behavior
   performance. The simulation-based interprofessional education group had
   more favorable learning outcomes, but the associated costs were higher.
   Educators should consider both learning outcomes and cost when choosing
   a design strategy simulation-based interprofessional education vs.
   video-enhanced interactive discussion interprofessional education for
   interprofessional education module development.},

Title = {Linking Workplace-Based Assessment to ACGME Milestones: A Comparison of
   Mapping Strategies in Two Specialties},

Abstract = {Construct: The construct that is assessed is competency in Pediatrics
   and Internal Medicine residency training. Background: The Accreditation
   Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) created milestones to
   measure learner progression toward competence over time but not as
   direct assessment tools. Ideal measurement of resident performance
   includes direct observation and assessment of patient care skills in the
   workplace. Residency programs have linked these concepts by mapping
   workplace-based assessments to the milestones of ACGME subcompetencies.
   Mapping is a subjective process, and little is known about specific
   techniques or the resulting consequences of mapping program-specific
   assessment data to larger frameworks of competency. Approach: In this
   article, the authors compare and contrast the techniques used to link
   workplace-based assessments called Observable Practice Activities (OPAs)
   to ACGME subcompetencies in two large academic residency programs from
   different specialties (Internal Medicine and Pediatrics). Descriptive
   analysis explored the similarities and differences in the assessment
   data generated by mapping assessment items to larger frameworks of
   competency. Results: Each program assessed the core competencies with
   similar frequencies. The largest discrepancy between the two
   subspecialties was the assessment of Medical Knowledge, which Internal
   Medicine assessed twice as often. Pediatrics also assessed the core
   competency Systems-based Practice almost twice as often as Internal
   Medicine. Both programs had several subcompetencies that were assessed
   more or less often than what appeared to be emphasized by the blueprint
   of mapping. Despite using independent mapping processes, both programs
   mapped each OPA to approximately three subcompetencies. Conclusions:
   Mapping workplace-based assessments to the ACGME subcompetencies allowed
   each program to see the whole of their curricula in ways that were not
   possible before and to identify existing curricular and assessment gaps.
   Although each program used similar assessment tools, the assessment data
   generated were different. The lessons learned in this work could inform
   other programs attempting to link their own workplace-based assessment
   elements to ACGME subcompetencies.},

Title = {Multi-Step Look-Ahead Optimization Methods for Dynamic Pricing With
   Demand Learning},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {88478-88497},
Abstract = {Dynamic pricing is a beneficial strategy for firms seeking to achieve
   high revenues. It has been widely applied to various domains such as the
   airline industry, the hotel industry, and e-services. Dynamic pricing is
   basically the problem of setting time-varying prices for a certain
   product or service for the purpose of optimizing revenue. However, a
   major challenge encountered when applying dynamic pricing is the lack of
   knowledge of the demand-price curve. The demand-price curve defines the
   customer's response towards changing the price. In this work, we address
   the dynamic pricing problem in case of unknown demand-price relation.
   This work introduces a less myopic pricing approach based on looking
   ahead for one or several future steps in our quest to optimize revenue.
   Specifically, the proposed formulation maximizes the summation of the
   immediate revenue and the expected future revenues of one or multiple
   look-ahead steps. A key benefit of the proposed approach is that it
   automatically strikes a balance between the conflicting goals of revenue
   maximization and demand learning, by producing less myopic and
   profitable prices. We provide a formulation for the presented look-ahead
   pricing approach, and we implement two variants of it: one-step and
   two-step look-ahead methods. Experiments are conducted on synthetic and
   real datasets to compare the proposed pricing methods to other pricing
   strategies in literature. The experimental results indicate that the
   proposed look-ahead methods outperform their counterparts in terms of
   the achieved revenue gain.},

Title = {The perceived value and impact of virtual simulation-based education on
   students' learning: a mixed methods study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {Background: Virtual simulations are used throughout healthcare training
   programs to enable development of clinical skills, however the potential
   for virtual simulation to enhance cognitive and affective skills is less
   well understood. This study explored pre-clinical optometry students'
   perceptions of the impact of virtual simulation on the development of
   core competency skills including patient-centred care, communication,
   scientific literacy, and evidence-based practice. Methods: A mixed
   methods study was conducted using pre-existing anonymized data from an
   electronic survey distributed to pre-clinical optometry students
   enrolled in the double degree Bachelor of Vision Science/Master of
   Optometry at Deakin University, Australia. The data were interpreted
   using descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis using constant
   comparison for thematic analysis. Results: A total of 51 responses were
   analyzed. Students reported that virtual simulation motivated them to
   become an optometrist (93\%) and to learn beyond the course material
   (77\%). Students reported that after participating in the virtual
   simulation, their core competency skills improved: patient-centered care
   (100\%) evidence-based practice (93\%) and clinical reasoning (93\%).
   The themes identified through qualitative analysis were: enablers to
   cognitive experience in virtual simulation in optometry education,
   realism of the virtual simulation design, dimensions of fidelity in
   virtual simulations design replicated the complexity of the optometric
   environment, virtual simulation as an enabler for learning and
   assessment in optometry education, a place to develop cognitive and
   affective skills and application of learning in the virtual simulation
   developed an appreciation of future roles and professional identity.
   Conclusion: Optometry students perceived virtual simulation in
   optometric education as a valuable training and assessment strategy
   enabled by qualities that generate contextual, cognitive, functional,
   task and psychological fidelity. The data provide insight to inform how
   optometry educators can incorporate simulation into the curriculum.},

Title = {The Asian Grocery Store-Based Cancer Education Program: Creating New
   Education Modules},

Abstract = {Operating since 1994, the UCSD Moores Cancer Center's Asian Grocery
   Store-Based Cancer Education Program (the Program) is a proven and
   sustainable strategy for disseminating cancer and poison control
   information to Asian and Pacific Islander (API) communities. This paper
   describes the process taken to identify health topics that can be
   readily addressed within the Program's infrastructure and reports
   results of the pilot testing of the educational module that was
   developed by following that process. The development of each new module
   is guided by the Health Belief Model and the Tipping Point Model. The
   process starts with the selection of a health topic demonstrating
   pressing need and treatment options in the API community. Then, using
   the Pareto principle, reasonably modifiable risk factors are chosen to
   be addressed in the module. ``Sticky messaging{''} for the modifiable
   risk factors is developed to package the health information as memorable
   and transmissible calls-to-action. Finally, grocery store outreaches
   were used to pilot test the new module to assess its effectiveness at
   facilitating health care information to API community members. By
   adhering to the steps described in this paper, the authors were able to:
   (1) select liver cancer as a pressing API health issue that could be
   positively impacted by the Program; (2) identify reasonably modifiable
   risk factors for the chosen health issue; (3) generate compelling
   call-to-action messages to decrease risk of exposure; and (4)
   demonstrate the cultural and linguistic alignment of the liver cancer
   control module. The development and testing of new health education
   modules follow a methodical process guided by scientific principles.
   Understanding and employing the elements of an existing evidence-based
   and sustainable health education program can increase the likelihood of
   success in addressing the health needs of the API community.},

Title = {Automatic recognition of student emotions from facial expressions during
   a lecture},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {148},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Emotions are of great significance in education as in all areas of human
   life. It is acknowledged that, although the cultures of people, the
   environment where they live, and the language they use vary, emotions
   that are evaluated as universal do exist. In this study, we examined the
   changes in the emotions of 67 students during the lectures of Basic
   Information Technologies who studied in three different departments in a
   state university in Mediterranean region. The facial expressions of the
   students were analyzed and digitalized in terms of the feelings of
   disgust, sadness, happiness, fear, contempt, anger and surprise by means
   of a software developed through Microsoft Emotion Recognition API and C
   \# programming language. During the lecture, we studied how student
   emotions varied and whether this change was statistically significant
   according to their departments, gender, lecture hours, the location of
   the computer in the classroom, lecture type and session information. The
   lesson plan consisted of three stages: introduction, activities and
   closure. The significance of the difference in emotions and the
   relationship between emotion change and achievement were examined
   according to three different stages. The research showed that feelings
   of contempt, anger, fear and confusion increased, while feelings of
   happiness, sadness and disgust decreased in the first stage of the
   lecture. It was determined that the feeling of happiness increased
   rapidly, whereas all other emotions decreased during the closure section
   of the lecture. We found that only the feeling of sadness displayed a
   significant difference according to the departments. It can be suggested
   that the equipment that provides instant feedback to the lecturer by
   monitoring the students' emotions automatically throughout the lecture
   can be made available throughout the educational institutions, thus
   contributing to the increase in the quality of education.},

Title = {Efficiently Mastering the Game of NoGo with Deep Reinforcement Learning
   Supported by Domain Knowledge},

Abstract = {Computer games have been regarded as an important field of artificial
   intelligence (AI) for a long time. The AlphaZero structure has been
   successful in the game of Go, beating the top professional human players
   and becoming the baseline method in computer games. However, the
   AlphaZero training process requires tremendous computing resources,
   imposing additional difficulties for the AlphaZero-based AI. In this
   paper, we propose NoGoZero+ to improve the AlphaZero process and apply
   it to a game similar to Go, NoGo. NoGoZero+ employs several innovative
   features to improve training speed and performance, and most improvement
   strategies can be transferred to other nonspecific areas. This paper
   compares it with the original AlphaZero process, and results show that
   NoGoZero+ increases the training speed to about six times that of the
   original AlphaZero process. Moreover, in the experiment, our agent beat
   the original AlphaZero agent with a score of 81:19 after only being
   trained by 20,000 self-play games' data (small in quantity compared with
   120,000 self-play games' data consumed by the original AlphaZero). The
   NoGo game program based on NoGoZero+ was the runner-up in the 2020 China
   Computer Game Championship (CCGC) with limited resources, defeating many
   AlphaZero-based programs. Our code, pretrained models, and self-play
   datasets are publicly available. The ultimate goal of this paper is to
   provide exploratory insights and mature auxiliary tools to enable AI
   researchers and computer-game communities to study, test, and improve
   these promising state-of-the-art methods at a much lower cost of
   computing resources.},

Title = {Nursing students' perceptions of learning after high fidelity
   simulation: Effects of a Three-step Post-simulation Reflection Model},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {40},
Pages = {219-224},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background: High-fidelity simulation (HFS) has become a bridge between
   theoretical knowledge and practical skills. A safe and realistic
   environment is commonly used in nursing education to improve cognitive,
   affective and psychomotor abilities. Debriefing following a simulation
   experience provides opportunities for students to analyze and begin to
   reflect upon their decisions, actions and results. The nursing
   literature highlights the need to promote the concept of reflective
   practice and to assist students in reflection, and research indicates
   the need to refine and develop debriefing strategies, which is the focus
   of the current paper.
   Purpose: To explore the value of reflections after HFS by investigating
   nursing students' perceptions of their learning when a Three-step
   Post-simulation Reflection Model is used.
   Design: A qualitative descriptive research approach was applied.
   Method: A Three-step Post-simulation Reflection Model that combined
   written and verbal reflections was used after an HFS experience in a
   second-year course in the Bachelor Program in Nursing at Lulea
   University of Technology, Sweden. Reflective texts written before and
   after a verbal group reflection were subjected to qualitative content
   analysis.
   Findings: The main theme in the first written reflections was identified
   as ``Starting to act as a nurse{''}, with the following categories:
   feeling stressed, inadequate and inexperienced; developing an awareness
   of the importance of never compromising patient safety; planning the
   work and prioritizing; and beginning to understand and implement nursing
   knowledge. The main theme in the second written reflections was
   identified to be ``Maturing in the profession{''}, with the following
   categories: appreciating colleagues, good communication and
   thoughtfulness; gaining increased self-awareness and confidence; and
   beginning to understand the profession.
   Conclusion: The Three-step Post-simulation Reflection Model fostered an
   appreciation of dear and effective communication. Having time for
   thoughtfulness and reflection promotes self-awareness and a better
   understanding of both the nursing profession and patient safety. The
   progress demonstrated in the depth of the themes in the written
   reflections indicates that repeated reflections stimulate and enhance
   student learning. The findings point towards the potential effectiveness
   of alternate methods of reflections. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Maddie's Shelter Medicine Program at the University of Florida College
   of Veterinary Medicine offers comprehensive training in shelter medicine
   to veterinary students based on a set of core job skills identified by
   the Association of Shelter Veterinarians. In 2012, this program began
   teaching online distance education courses to students and practicing
   veterinarians worldwide who sought additional training in this newly
   recognized specialty area. Distance learning is a novel educational
   strategy in veterinary medicine; most instruction at veterinary medical
   schools is classroom based. No previous studies have shown whether
   online courses can prepare veterinarians to practice shelter medicine.
   In this study, we investigated how an online, graduate-level course
   titled ``Shelter Animal Physical Health'' changed student self-reported
   confidence. First, we compared pre-course confidence regarding eight
   specific shelter medical practice scenarios to post-course confidence
   through statistical analysis. Quantitative analysis showed a significant
   (p<.001) increase in self-reported confidence for all eight scenarios.
   Next, we used open coding to identify themes within reflection papers
   that students were asked to write during the course and used those
   findings to corroborate or refute the quantitative results. Qualitative
   analysis of students' reflection papers identified six themes:
   confidence, communication, population management, outbreak management,
   medical care, and application. The results of this study show that
   distance education can be an effective method of preparing veterinarians
   and veterinary students to practice shelter medicine.},

Abstract = {Objective. To explore pharmacist alumni perspectives on what topics and
   how the business of health care should be incorporated into pharmacy
   school training.Methods. An exploratory sequential mixed-methods design
   was used. Focus groups were conducted to elicit pharmacist alumni
   perspectives about business of health care topics and strategies for
   student learn-ing and curricular implementation. Purposive sampling was
   used to identify alumni participants who could provide substantive
   feedback aligned with the needs of this evaluation. Ten alumni attended
   one of three focus groups over a two-month period. Thematic coding was
   used to identify themes. Results from the focus groups were used to
   inform survey development distributed to alumni of the pharmacy school.
   Survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.Results. Findings
   from the focus groups and survey indicated that the business topics most
   important for students to learn were communication strategies, health
   care operations, the health care payer system, managing teams, and
   career options within pharmacy. Focus group participants recommended a
   variety of activities to help students learn and apply business topics
   and emphasized that simulations and real -world experiences were needed
   to help students learn these topics and assess their understanding.
   Instruc-tors should be currently or recently employed in the business
   sector to provide credibility. Barriers to implementation occur at both
   the student and curricula level.Conclusion. The possession of business
   skills and knowledge play a critical role in helping the pharmacy
   profession advance within a dynamic health care environment.
   Recommendations were provided on key business content important for
   Doctor of Pharmacy students to learn and strategies to implement within
   a pharmacy program.},

Title = {The Health Professions Education Pathway: Preparing Students, Residents,
   and Fellows to Become Future Educators},
Journal = {TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {216-227},
Abstract = {Problem: Training the next generation of health professionals requires
   leaders, innovators, and scholars in education. Although many medical
   schools and residencies offer education electives or tracks focused on
   developing teaching skills, these programs often omit educational
   innovation, scholarship, and leadership and are narrowly targeted to one
   level of learner. Intervention: The University of California San
   Francisco created the Health Professions Education Pathway for medical
   students, residents, and fellows as well as learners from other health
   professional schools. The Pathway applies the theoretical framework of
   communities of practice in its curricular design to promote learner
   identity formation as future health professions educators. It employs
   the strategies of engagement, imagination, and alignment for identity
   formation. Context: Through course requirements, learners engage and
   work with members of the educator community of practice to develop the
   knowledge and skills required to participate in the community. Pathway
   instructors are faculty members who model a breadth of educator careers
   to help learners imagine personal trajectories. Last, learners complete
   mentored education projects, adopting scholarly methods and ethics to
   align with the broader educator community of practice. Outcome: From
   2009 to 2014, 117 learners participated in the Pathway. Program
   evaluations, graduate surveys, and web-based searches revealed positive
   impacts on learner career development. Learners gained knowledge and
   skills for continued engagement with the educator community of practice,
   confirmed their career aspirations (imagination), joined an
   educator-in-training community (engagement/imagination), and
   disseminated via scholarly meetings and peer-reviewed publications
   (alignment). Lessons Learned: Learners identified engagement with the
   learner community as the most powerful aspect of the Pathway; it
   provided peer support for imagining and navigating the development of
   their dual identities in the clinician and educator communities of
   practice. Also important for learner success was alignment of their
   projects with the goals of the local educator community of practice. Our
   community of practice approach to educator career development has shown
   promising early outcomes by nurturing learners' passion for teaching;
   expanding their interest in educational leadership, innovation, and
   scholarship; and focusing on their identity formation as future
   educators.},

Title = {SecOFF-FCIoT: Machine learning based secure offloading in Fog-Cloud of
   things for smart city applications},
Journal = {INTERNET OF THINGS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Computation offloading is one of the important application in Internet
   of Things (IoT) ecosystem. Computational offloading provides assisted
   means of processing large amounts of data generated by abundant IoT
   devices, speed up processing of intensive tasks and save battery life.
   In this paper, we propose a secure computation offloading scheme in
   Fog-Cloud-IoT environment (SecOFF-FCIoT). Using machine learning
   strategies, we accomplish efficient, secure offloading in Fog-IoT
   setting. In particular, we employ Neuro-Fuzzy Model to secure data at
   the smart gateway, then the IoT device selects an optimal Fog node to
   which it can offload its workload using Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO)
   via the smart gateway. If the fog node is not capable of handling the
   workload, it is forwarded to the cloud after being classified as either
   sensitive or non-sensitive. Sensitive data is maintained in private
   cloud. Whereas non-sensitive data is offloaded using dynamic offloading
   strategy. In PSO, the availability of fog node is computed using two
   metrics; i) Available Processing Capacity (APC), and ii) Remaining Node
   Energy (RNE). Selection of cloud is based on Reinforcement Learning. Our
   proposed approach is implemented for smart city applications using NS-3
   simulator with JAVA Programming. We compare our proposed secure
   computation offloading model with previous approaches which include
   DTO-SO, FCFS, LOTEC, and CMS-ACO. Simulation results show that our
   proposed scheme minimizes latency as compared to selected benchmarks.

Title = {Overcoming the Challenges of Direct Observation and Feedback Programs: A
   Qualitative Exploration of Resident and Faculty Experiences},
Journal = {TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE},

Abstract = {Problem:Prior studies have reported significant negative attitudes
   amongst both faculty and residents toward direct observation and
   feedback. Numerous contributing factors have been identified, including
   insufficient time for direct observation and feedback, poorly understood
   purpose, inadequate training, disbelief in the formative intent,
   inauthentic resident-patient clinical interactions, undermining of
   resident autonomy, lack of trust between the faculty-resident dyad, and
   low-quality feedback information that lacks credibility. Strategies are
   urgently needed to overcome these challenges and more effectively engage
   faculty and residents in direct observation and feedback. Otherwise, the
   primary goals of supporting both formative and summative assessment will
   not be realized and the viability of competency-based medical education
   will be threatened.Intervention:Toward this end, recent studies have
   recommended numerous strategies to overcome these barriers: protected
   time for direct observation and feedback; ongoing faculty and resident
   training on goals and bidirectional, co-constructed feedback; repeated
   direct observations and feedback within a longitudinal
   resident-supervisor relationship; utilization of assessment tools with
   evidence for validity; and monitoring for engagement. Given the
   complexity of the problem, it is likely that bundling multiple
   strategies together will be necessary to overcome the challenges. The
   Direct Observation Structured Feedback Program (DOSFP) incorporated many
   of the recommended features, including protected time for direct
   observation and feedback within longitudinal faculty-resident
   relationships. Using a qualitative thematic approach the authors
   conducted semi-structured interviews, during February and March, 2019,
   with 10 supervisors and ten residents. Participants were asked to
   reflect on their experiences. Interview guide questions explored key
   themes from the literature on direct observation and feedback.
   Transcripts were anonymized. Two authors independently and iteratively
   coded the transcripts. Coding was theory-driven and differences were
   discussed until consensus was reached. The authors then explored the
   relationships between the codes and used a semantic approach to
   construct themes.Context:The DOSFP was implemented in a psychiatry
   continuity clinic for second and third year residents.Impact:Faculty and
   residents were aligned around the goals. They both perceived the DOSFP
   as focused on growth rather than judgment even though residents
   understood that the feedback had both formative and summative purposes.
   The DOSFP facilitated educational alliances characterized by trust and
   respect. With repeated practice within a longitudinal relationship,
   trainees dropped the performance orientation and described their
   interactions with patients as authentic. Residents generally perceived
   the feedback as credible, described feedback quality as high, and valued
   the two-way conversation. However, when receiving feedback with which
   they did not agree, residents demurred or, at most, would ask a
   clarifying question, but then internally discounted the feedback.Lessons
   Learned:Direct observation and structured feedback programs that bundle
   recent recommendations may overcome many of the challenges identified by
   previous research. Yet, residents discounted disagreeable feedback,
   illustrating a significant limitation and the need for other strategies
   that help residents reconcile conflict between external data and one's
   self-appraisal.},

Abstract = {This single case study (Yin, 2009) compares an established urban
   physical education/sport/physical activity program with two models:
   Comprehensive School Physical Activity Program/CSPAP (AAHPERD, 2013;
   CDC, 2013); and Lawson's propositions (2005) for sport, exercise and
   physical education for empowerment and community development to
   determine their applicability in urban schools. Data include
   semistructured interviews, multiple observations, and artifacts
   collected over two academic years. Triangulation, peer debriefing, and
   interpretative and member checks were used for trustworthiness. Findings
   indicate that most aspects of both theories were evident in the program,
   though goals exceeded those of CSPAP as stated, and Lawson's concept of
   ``community{''} was limited. Major themes related to establishing this
   CSPAP are described, including practical strategies for budget,
   scheduling and staffing, and qualities of leadership. Stakeholders
   reported that they valued the program not for student wellness, but for
   personal, social and academic well being, as well as for contributions
   to the school culture.},

Abstract = {Low stakes assessment without grading the performance of students in
   educational systems has received increasing attention in recent years.
   It is used in formative assessments to guide the learning process as
   well as in large-scales assessments to monitor educational programs.
   Yet, such assessments suffer from high variation in students'
   test-taking effort. We aimed to identify institutional strategies
   related to serious test-taking behavior in low stakes assessment to
   provide medical schools with practical recommendations on how
   test-taking effort might be increased. First, we identified strategies
   that were already used by medical schools to increase the serious
   test-taking behavior on the low stakes Berlin Progress Test (BPT).
   Strategies which could be assigned to self-determination theory of Ryan
   and Deci were chosen for analysis. We conducted the study at nine
   medical schools in Germany and Austria with a total of 108,140
   observations in an established low stakes assessment. A generalized
   linear-mixed effects model was used to assess the association between
   institutional strategies and the odds that students will take the BPT
   seriously. Overall, two institutional strategies were found to be
   positively related to more serious test-taking behavior: discussing low
   test performance with the mentor and consequences for not participating.
   Giving choice was negatively related to more serious test-taking
   behavior. At medical schools that presented the BPT as evaluation, this
   effect was larger in comparison to medical schools that presented the
   BPT as assessment.},

   Elective that Incorporates Human Patient Simulation Technology},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {78},
Number = {8},
Abstract = {Objective. To design an elective for pharmacy students that facilitates
   antimicrobial stewardship awareness, knowledge, and skill development by
   solving clinical cases, using human patient simulation technology.
   Design. The elective was designed for PharmD students to describe
   principles and functions of stewardship programs, select, evaluate,
   refine, or redesign patient-specific plans for infectious diseases in
   the context of antimicrobial stewardship, and propose criteria and
   stewardship management strategies for an antimicrobial class at a health
   care institution. Teaching methods included active learning and
   lectures. Cases of bacterial endocarditis and cryptococcal meningitis
   were developed that incorporated human patient simulation technology.
   Assessment. Forty-five pharmacy students completed an antimicrobial
   stewardship elective between 2010 and 2013. Outcomes were assessed using
   student perceptions of and performance on rubric-graded assignments.
   Conclusion. A PharmD elective using active learning, including novel
   cases conducted with human patient simulation technology, enabled
   outcomes consistent with those desired of pharmacists assisting in
   antimicrobial stewardship programs.},

Title = {Self-Learning Enhanced Energy Management for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Bus
   With a Target Preview Based SOC Plan Method},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {103153-103166},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a self-learning enhanced energy management for
   plug-in hybrid electric bus (PHEB). Two innovations are made to
   distinguish our contributions from others. First, a target preview-based
   reference SOC plan method is proposed, where a linear reference SOC
   trajectory will be re-planed at fixed time steps (every 60 s) by taking
   the expected SOC at the destination as the target, and a feasible zone
   is exclusively defined to provide a margin for the fuel economy
   improvement. Second, a reinforcement learning-Pontryagin's minimum
   principle (RL-PMP)-based energy management constituted by the RL and PMP
   algorithms is proposed, where the average velocity with time moving, the
   SOC, and the normalized trip distance are taken as states and the
   co-state is taken as the action. Different from the conventional RL
   methods, the co-sate is only updated at the fixed time step, and the
   reward will be evaluated in the next 60 s. This can greatly accelerate
   the training process of the RL-PMP. In addition, the driving conditions
   in the next 60 s are predicted by a designed Markov chain. The
   simulation results demonstrate that the fuel economy of the RL-PMP is
   close to the dynamic programming (DP) and can be averagely improved by
   14.155\% compared to the rule-based control strategy.},

Abstract = {Distributed machine learning (DML) is an increasingly important
   workload. In a DML job, each communication phase can comprise a coflow,
   and there are dependencies among its coflows. Thus, efficient coflow
   scheduling becomes critical for DML jobs. However, the majority of
   existing solutions focus on scheduling single-stage coflows with no
   dependencies. While there are a few studies schedule dependent coflows
   of multi-stage jobs, they suffer from either practical or theoretical
   issues. Motivated by this situation, we study how to schedule dependent
   coflows of multiple DML jobs to minimize the total JCT in a shared
   cluster. We present a formal mathematical formulation for this problem
   and prove its NP-hardness. To solve this problem without job size
   information, we present an online coflow-aware optimization framework
   called Parrot. The core idea in Parrot is to infer the job with the
   shortest remaining processing time (SRPT) each time and dynamically
   control the inferred job's bandwidth based on how confident it is an
   SRPT job while being mindful of not starving any other job.
   Specifically, in the design of Parrot, we present a least per-coflow
   attained service (LPCAS) policy to infer the SRPT job. We further
   propose a dynamic job weight assignment mechanism and a linear program
   (LP) based weighted bandwidth scaling strategy for sharing bandwidth
   among DML jobs. We have proved that Parrot algorithm has a non-trivial
   competitive ratio. The results from large-scale trace-driven simulations
   further demonstrate that our Parrot can reduce the total JCT by up to
   58.4 percent, compared to the state-of-the-art Aalo solution.},

Abstract = {Background: Nursing handovers are a crucial nursing practice for patient
   safety and continuity of nursing care. As a strategy to improve nursing
   handovers, it has been suggested that new graduate nurses receive
   training in how to conduct handovers.
   Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of
   simulation-based handover training and peer learning handover training
   on clinical competence regarding handovers and clinical judgment among
   new graduate nurses.
   Design: Quasi-experimental research using a nonequivalent control group
   post-test design.
   Participants: A convenience sample of 55 new graduate nurses with no
   clinical experience who expected to work at a university hospital were
   selected.
   Methods: We measured participants' clinical competence regarding
   handovers and clinical judgment immediately after completing a training
   program and after 1 month of working at a hospital to examine the
   immediate and latent effects of simulation-based and peer-learning
   handover training, respectively. A researcher developed clinical
   competence instrument regarding handovers and a clinical judgment
   instrument based on the Lasater Clinical Judgment Rubric were used. To
   identify differences in the effects of simulation-based and peer
   learning handover training, we analyzed the data using the independent
   t-test and paired t-test. When evaluating the latent effects, the
   participants wrote self-reflection reports.
   Results: There were no significant differences in the immediate effects
   of the simulation-based training and the peer-learning training. In
   contrast, in the evaluation of the latent effects, new graduate nurses
   who received simulation-based training showed significantly higher
   clinical competence regarding handovers (p = .020) and clinical judgment
   (p = .033) than their counterparts who received peer-learning training.
   In the self-reflection reports, 19 participants stated that they had
   gained more confidence with handovers.
   Conclusion: We suggest that simulation-based handover training
   contributes more to the improvement of new graduate nurses' clinical
   competence regarding handovers and clinical judgment than peer-learning
   training.},

Title = {One Model of Residency Journal Clubs With Multifaceted Support},

Abstract = {Problem: The field of medical education is represented by a fairly wide
   variety of models for utilizing journal clubs as an effective teaching
   tool, each with varying levels of empirical support. Our own prior
   attempts at developing and implementing an effective journal club
   required improvements. Intervention: Our intervention consisted of an
   innovative, effective journal club model that has more well-defined
   elements that are readily adaptable for other residency programs. The
   collective strategies were based on the previous literature and our own
   experiences. Context: Our intervention was implemented in a department
   of psychiatry within a university-based medical school. Study
   participants came from a psychiatry department's residency programs (N =
   36) during academic year 2011-2012 with senior residents having the
   option to attend journal club. Using a multifaceted approach, measures
   included attendance, presession quizzes, postsession evaluations, and a
   final postcourse evaluation of 11 dimensions (e.g., goals, objectives).
   Outcome: Thirty-one (86\%) trainees attended journal club-a substantial
   increase from previous years. The presession-quiz median was 4.4 total
   correct out of 6 questions (range = 3.3-5.3), indicating that the
   articles were generally read before the session. The
   postsession-evaluation median was 4.6 (1-5 scale, 5 the highest; range =
   4.1-4.8), indicating sessions were well received. The final
   postcourse-evaluation overall mean was 3.9 (1-5 scale, 5 the highest;
   subscale M range = 3.4-4.5). Qualitative and quantitative analyses of
   the postcourse evaluation indicated the following positive aspects:
   educational objectives generally met, overall structured format, quality
   of discussions, individuals involved (e.g., course directors, trainees,
   faculty facilitators), and availability of food. Areas of possible
   improvement included time management within the sessions, more
   contemporary and clinically relevant articles, consistency in faculty
   moderators, and evaluation process. Engagement in learning appeared to
   have been dramatically increased through five strategies: (a) meaningful
   incentives; (b) assigned, engaged consistently prepared faculty; (c)
   meaningful evaluation; (d) prejournal club preparations that helped
   residents assimilate critical appraisal with time-and-task-management
   skills; and (e) a planning group that developed and improved curricula
   and instruction to meet the objectives of the course. Lessons Learned:
   Overall, effective, and successful journal clubs require systematic
   planning, implementation, modification, and refinement.},

Abstract = {This study considers an NP-hard problem of minimizing the total
   tardiness on a single machine with arbitrary release dates and
   position-dependent learning effects. A mixed-integer programming (MIP)
   model is first formulated to find the optimal solution for small-size
   problem instances. Some new dominance rules are then presented which
   provide a sufficient condition for finding local optimality. The
   branch-and-bound (B\& B) strategy incorporating with several dominance
   properties and a lower bound is proposed to derive the optimal solution
   for medium- to-large-size problem instances, and four
   marriage-in-honey-bees optimization algorithms (MBO) are developed to
   derive near-optimal solutions for the problem. To show the effectiveness
   of the proposed algorithms, 3600 situations with 20 and 25 jobs, are
   randomly generated for experiments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Building capacity for knowledge translation in occupational therapy:
   learning through participatory action research},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Background: There has been widespread acknowledgement of the need to
   build capacity in knowledge translation however much of the existing
   work focuses on building capacity amongst researchers rather than with
   clinicians directly. This paper's aim is to describe a research project
   for developing a knowledge translation capacity building program for
   occupational therapy clinicians.
   Methods: Participatory action research methods were used to both develop
   and evaluate the knowledge translation capacity-building program.
   Participants were occupational therapists from a large metropolitan
   hospital in Australia. Researchers and clinicians worked together to use
   the action cycle of the Knowledge to Action Framework to increase use of
   knowledge translation itself within the department in general, within
   their clinical teams, and to facilitate knowledge translation becoming
   part of the department's culture. Barriers and enablers to using
   knowledge translation were identified through a survey based on the
   Theoretical Domains Framework and through focus groups. Multiple
   interventions were used to develop a knowledge translation
   capacity-building program.
   Results: Fifty-two occupational therapists participated initially, but
   only 20 across the first 18 months of the project. Barriers and enablers
   were identified across all domains of the Theoretical Domains Framework.
   Interventions selected to address these barriers or facilitate enablers
   were categorised into ten different categories: educational outreach;
   teams working on clinical knowledge translation case studies;
   identifying time blocks for knowledge translation; mentoring; leadership
   strategies; communication strategies; documentation and resources to
   support knowledge translation; funding a knowledge translation champion
   one day per week; setting goals for knowledge translation; and knowledge
   translation reporting strategies. Use of these strategies was, and
   continues to be monitored. Participants continue to be actively involved
   in learning and shaping the knowledge translation program across the
   department and within their specific clinical areas.
   Conclusion: To build capacity for knowledge translation, it is important
   to involve clinicians. The action cycle of the Knowledge to Action
   framework is a useful guide to introduce the knowledge translation
   process to clinicians. It may be used to engage the department as a
   whole, and facilitate the learning and application of knowledge
   translation within specific clinical areas. Research evaluating this
   knowledge translation program is being conducted.},

Abstract = {Science is rapidly changing with vast amounts of new information and
   technologies available. However, traditional instructional formats do
   not adequately prepare a diverse population of learners who need to
   evaluate and use knowledge, not simply memorize facts. Moreover,
   curricular change has been glacially slow. One starting goal for
   curricular change can be identifying the features of a current
   curriculum, including potential areas for improvement, but a model is
   needed to accomplish that goal. The vast majority of studies related to
   curricular change have been conducted in K-12 environments, with an
   increasing number in post-secondary environments. Herein, we describe a
   model for science curriculum evaluation that we designed by integrating
   a number of different approaches. That model evaluates the intended,
   enacted, and achieved components of the curriculum, anchored by
   analyzing learning outcomes through five lenses: (i) a
   scientificFrameworkreported by the US National Research Council, (ii)
   systems thinking, (iii) equity, diversity, and inclusion, (iv)
   professional skills, and (v) learning skills. No curriculum evaluation
   models to date have used the five learning outcomes lenses that we
   describe herein. As a proof of principle, we applied the evaluation
   model to one organic chemistry course, which revealed areas of strength
   and possible deficiencies. This model could be used to evaluate other
   science courses or programs. Possible deficiencies may be addressed in
   other courses, in the course at hand, or may not be deemed necessary or
   important to address, demonstrating the potential for this evaluation to
   generate areas for discussion and ultimately, improvements to
   post-secondary science education.},

Title = {Pharmacy Students' Perspectives on Interprofessional Learning in a
   Simulated Patient Care Ward Environment},

Abstract = {Objective. To assess pharmacy students' opinions of an interprofessional
   learning (IPL) course in their final year of the Bachelor of Pharmacy
   program at The University of Auckland.
   Methods. Pharmacy students participated in the second day of a two-day
   simulation-based course, WardSim, alongside medical and nursing students
   in an acute care, hospital ward setting. After finishing the course, all
   students were asked to complete a questionnaire. The responses of
   pharmacy, nursing, and medical students on the scaled questions were
   compared. An in-depth thematic analysis of the pharmacy students'
   responses to the open-ended questions was completed using an iterative
   process.
   Results. Significant differences were found among the students'
   responses regarding the prioritization of care, systematic assessment of
   patients, and communication strategies. Pharmacy students had less
   favourable responses regarding the IPL experience than medical and
   nursing students. However, overall responses were positive. Some of the
   themes that emerged among the pharmacy students' responses included:
   learning communication tools, being assertive in communicating with
   other health care professionals, and understanding their own and others'
   roles in the health care team. Furthermore, some pharmacy students
   reported feeling underprepared for and underutilized during patient care
   scenarios.
   Conclusion. An IPL experience in an acute patient care setting
   demonstrated clear and beneficial learning outcomes for pharmacy
   students, especially in regards to communicating and understanding their
   roles and those of others on their team. Tailoring the pre-work or
   scenarios for the IPL experience to be more pharmacy orientated and
   having pharmacy students participate on both days may improve the
   preparedness for IPL.},

Title = {Reinforcement Learning Based Power Control for In-Body Sensors in WBANs
   Against Jamming},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Abstract = {Wireless body area networks (WBANs) have to address jamming attacks to
   support health-care applications. In this paper, we present a
   reinforcement learning-based power control scheme for the communication
   between the in-body sensors and the WBAN coordinator to resist jamming
   attacks. This scheme applies Q-learning to guide the coordinator to
   achieve an optimal power control strategy without being aware of the
   in-body sensor's transmission parameters and the WBAN model of the other
   sensors in the dynamic anti-jamming transmission. In addition, a
   transfer learning method is adopted to accelerate the learning speed.
   Stackelberg equilibria and their existence conditions are deduced in a
   single time slot to upper bound the performance of the learning-based
   sensor power control scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed
   scheme can efficiently increase the utilities and decrease the
   transmission energy consumptions for the in-body sensors and the WBAN
   coordinator, and simultaneously reduce the attack possibility of the
   jammer compared with a standard Q-learning-based sensor power control
   scheme.},

Abstract = {Over the last two decades, as microprocessors have evolved to achieve
   higher computational performance, their power density has also increased
   at an accelerated rate. Improving energy efficiency and reducing power
   consumption are therefore critically important to modern computing
   systems. One effective technique for improving energy efficiency is
   dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). With the emergence of
   integrated voltage regulators (IVRs), the speed of DVFS can reach
   microsecond (mu s) timescales. However, a practical and effective
   strategy to guide fast DVFS remains a challenge. In this article, we
   propose F-LEMMA: a fast, learning-based, hier-archical DVFS framework
   consisting of a global power allocator in the kernel space, a
   reinforcement learning-based power man-agement scheme at the
   architecture level, and a swift controller at the digital circuit level.
   This hierarchical approach lever-ages computation at the system and
   architecture levels with the short response time of the swift controller
   to achieve effec-tive and rapid mu s-level power management supported by
   the IVR. Our experimental results demonstrate that F-LEMMA can achieve
   significant energy savings (35.2\%) across a broad range of workloads.
   Conservatively compared with existing state-of-the-art DVFS-based power
   management schemes that can only operate at millisecond timescales,
   F-LEMMA can provide notable (up to 11\%) energy-delay product (EDP)
   improvements across benchmarks. Compared with state-of-the-art
   nonlearning-based power management, our method has a universally
   positive effect on evaluated benchmarks, proving its adaptability.},

Abstract = {The Ohio State University Multidisciplinary Capstone Program provides
   opportunities for engineering and non-engineering students to
   participate in an industry-partnered capstone experience through a
   two-semester course sequence with realistic projects defined by the
   sponsor and program. The program recently concluded a three-year effort
   to obtain formalized responses from its industry-partners, program
   alumni and students who had just finished the multidisciplinary capstone
   experience. The primary focus was on establishing rankings of the
   corresponding stakeholder's perspectives to the importance of the
   program's learning outcomes and relevant accreditation board for
   engineering and technology criteria, and the program's contribution to
   the student's preparedness. Key comparisons were made between each of
   the stakeholders. The results were also compared to the rankings of
   important knowledge, skills and abilities for all engineering students
   identified by the Transforming Undergraduate Engineering Education Phase
   I workshop study; a study conducted by the American Society for
   Engineering Education in 2013 to develop a strategy for undergraduate
   engineering education that meets the needs of industry in the 21st
   century. The data for each survey is provided with key observations and
   discussions on how the surveys are being used to continuously improve
   the multidisciplinary capstone program at Ohio State.},

Abstract = {This study investigated how the students' pseudoscientific beliefs could
   be lessened by using online argumentation. With the aid of an online
   argumentation system for argumentation instruction and activities for
   students during the experiment, 77 Taiwanese university students
   together with 71 Taiwanese high school students (148 students in total)
   took part in this study. A quasi-experimental design was adopted and
   quantitative analyses were conducted. The results showed that using an
   online argumentation system for argumentation instruction and activities
   could lessen students' pseudoscientific beliefs. The experimental group
   students were lower than their counterparts in terms of mean
   pseudoscientific beliefs in the post-test and delayed test. After the
   experimental group students went through the online argumentation,
   changes in the percentage of students believing in four out of ten
   pseudoscientific items reached significance. However, as
   pseudoscientific beliefs are dependent on the cultural background,
   generalization of the results in this present study may be limited by
   cultural context. Finally, this study proposed suggestions related to
   argumentation research and science instruction counteracting students'
   pseudoscientific beliefs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A practical guide for implementing and maintaining value-added clinical
   systems learning roles for medical students using a diffusion of

Abstract = {After emphasizing biomedical and clinical sciences for over a century,
   US medical schools are expanding experiential roles that allow students
   to learn about health care delivery while also adding value to patient
   care. After developing a program where all 1st-year medical students are
   integrated into interprofessional care teams to contribute to patient
   care, authors use a diffusion of innovations framework to explore and
   identify barriers, facilitators, and best practices for implementing
   value-added clinical systems learning roles. In 2016, authors conducted
   32 clinical-site observations, 29 1:1 interviews with mentors, and four
   student focus-group interviews. Data were transcribed verbatim, and a
   thematic analysis was used to identify themes. Authors discussed drafts
   of the categorization scheme, and agreed upon results and quotations. Of
   36 sites implementing the program, 17 (47\%) remained, 8 (22\%)
   significantly modified, and 11 (31\%) withdrew from the program.
   Identified strategies for implementing value-added roles included:
   student education, patient characteristics, patient selection methods,
   activities performed, and resources. Six themes influencing program
   implementation and maintenance included: (1) educational benefit, (2)
   value added to patient care from student work, (3) mentor time and site
   capacity, (4) student engagement, (5) working relationship between
   school, site, and students, and, (6) students' continuity at the site.
   Health systems science is an emerging focus for medical schools, and
   educators are challenged to design practice-based roles that enhance
   education and add value to patient care. Health professions' schools
   implementing value-added roles will need to invest resources and
   strategize about best-practice strategies to guide efforts.},

Abstract = {The use of standardized patients for simulation-based learning was
   integrated into the Master of Nursing curriculum in the 2012-2013
   academic year. The study aimed to explore the Master of Nursing
   students' experiences with and perceptions of using standardized
   patients in simulations, and to identify the students learning needs in
   preparing to become advanced practice nurses. The study adopted an
   exploratory descriptive qualitative design, using a focus group
   interview. The study was conducted at a university in Singapore. Seven
   Master of Nursing students who were enrolled in the Acute Care Track of
   Master of Nursing program in the 2012-2013 academic year participated in
   the study. The data were gathered at the end of the first semester.
   Content analysis was used to analyze the data. Three main categories -
   usefulness, clinical limitations, and realism - were identified in the
   study. The results revealed that the students felt using standardized
   patients was useful and realistic for developing skills in history
   taking, communication, and responding to an emergency situation. On the
   other hand, they found that the standardized patients were limited in
   providing critical signs and symptoms of case scenarios. To meet the
   learning objectives, future development and integration of standardized
   patients in the Master of Nursing curriculum might need to be considered
   along with the use of a high-fidelity simulator. This can be an
   alternative strategy to fill the gaps in each method. Obviously, using
   standardized patients for simulation-based learning has added value to
   the students' learning experiences. It is highly recommended that future
   studies explore the impact of using standardized patients on students'
   performance in clinical settings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {An Orthogonal Learning Bird Swarm Algorithm for Optimal Power Flow
   Problems},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {23659-23680},
Abstract = {A dominant statistical method, in which the best combination of factors'
   levels are predicted by analyzing a few representative combinations of
   factors' levels, named as orthogonal experimental design (OED). The OED
   is an effective approach for analyzing the effect of multi-levels
   factors simultaneously and it works on orthogonal learning (OL)
   strategy. An evolutionary programming based heuristic method has two
   contradictory features-exploration and exploitation, balancing in these
   features have significant impact on its optimization performance. We
   have applied an OED based auxiliary search strategy for enhancing
   performance of the bird swarm algorithm (BSA) by improving its
   exploitation search ability. It is a challenging task to keep balance
   among two contradictory features-exploration and exploitation of a
   heuristic approach, while addressing optimal power flow (OPF) problems
   in power systems. In this research study, we have proposed improved BSA
   (IBSA) for solving the OPF problems in thermal power systems. We have
   conducted a study of the OPF problems with objective functions-reducing
   electricity generation cost, emission pollution, and active power loss
   to measure the efficiency of proposed IBSA. In this work, we have
   utilized five benchmark functions and solved OPF problems using three
   IEEE test systems including IEEE-30 bus system, IEEE-57 bus system, and
   IEEE-118 bus system to verify stability, effectiveness, and performance
   of proposed IBSA. The statistical and simulation results have indicated
   that the proposed IBSA has better convergence, efficiency, and
   robustness features than the original BSA as well as other heuristic
   approaches. It is observed that lowest electricity generation cost
   800.3975 \$/h on IEEE-30 bus system, 41663.5500\$ /h on IEEE-57 bus
   system, and 134941.0367 \$ /h on IEEE-118 bus system have been achieved
   using proposed IBSA to address the OPF problems. Furthermore, in
   transmission lines of the power system network minimum active power loss
   16.2869MW has been observed by conducting a case study on the IEEE
   118-bus system based on the proposed IBSA approach.},

Abstract = {Virtual education raises to students and teachers important challenges,
   normally different to those faced in conventional education. In the
   context of virtual education, a question that remains to be solved is
   associated with the level of motivation possessed by the students during
   the course. Usually, at the School of Engineering in the University of
   Medellin, this issue is tackled through activities such as chats and
   forums. Mostly, these activities are not enough to motivate the student
   in the activities related with the learning process. This work proposes
   two motivation strategies based on gamification and constructivism.
   These strategies are validated in a course called programming
   fundamentals, taught to all bachelor degrees given in the School of
   Engineering. Results obtained through the experiments suggest that
   proposed strategies improve the student's performance and satisfaction
   in the course. Therefore, when teaching at the virtual scenario, using
   Information and Communication Technologies in the educational
   environment is not only the way to contact the student, it is the mean
   to develop pedagogical-didactic approaches that finally enrich the
   educational process and consequently motivate the student to perform
   well.},

Abstract = {Precision medicine, a popular treatment strategy, has become
   increasingly important to the development of targeted therapy. To
   correlate medical imaging with prognostic and genomic data, researches
   in radiomics and radiogenomics have provided many pre-defined image
   features to describe image information quantitatively or qualitatively.
   However, in previous researches, there are only statistical results
   which prove high correlation among multi-source medical data, but those
   can't give intuitive and visual result. In this paper, a deep learning
   based radiogenomic framework is provided to construct the linkage from
   lung tumor images to genomic data and implement generation process in
   turn, which form a bi-direction framework to map multi-source medical
   data. The imaging features are extracted from autoencoder under the
   condition of genomic data. It can obtain much more relevant features
   than traditional radiogenomic methods. Finally, we use generative
   adversarial network to transform genomic data onto tumor images, which
   gives a cogent result to explain the linkage between them. As a result,
   our framework provides a deep learning method to do radiogenomic
   researches more functionally and intuitively.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUNDEstablishing and maintaining a positive, inclusive social
   climate in school is essential, especially given the many potential
   social pressures that make school a toxic environment for vulnerable
   students. We explored middle school physical education (PE) teachers'
   perceptions of the factors that influence the implementation of
   social-oriented approaches to include overweight and obese students.
   METHODSWe used a qualitative multicase study design guided by the Social
   Ecological Constraints model to study 9 PE teachers' perspectives and
   actions. We analyzed the transcripts of semistructured interviews, field
   notes, and artifacts related to teaching, PE programs, and school
   policies. Trust was established in conventional ways.
   RESULTSSocial-ecological factors influenced teachers including program
   and school culture, policies, and norms of collaboration. Teachers acted
   beyond their instructional setting level strategies and used
   school-program level strategies to socially include overweight and obese
   in PE.
   CONCLUSIONSSome environments challenge employment of more than simple
   accommodations and a caring attitude; in others, teachers can
   collaborate with other school personnel to teach social goals through
   negotiating constraints, creating ingenious modifications and
   interactive tasks, and incorporating personal and social skills as a
   primary curricular goal.},

Title = {Using collaborative two-stage examinations to address test anxiety in a
   large enrollment gateway course},
Journal = {ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},

Pages = {409-422},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Large enrollment foundational courses are perceived as high stakes
   because of their potential to act as barriers for progression to the
   next course or admittance to a program. The nature of gateway courses
   makes them ideal settings to explore the relationship between anxiety,
   pedagogical interventions, and student performance. Here, two-stage
   collaborative examinations were implemented to improve test-taking
   skills and address widespread test anxiety in an introductory human
   anatomy course. Test anxiety data were collected (using the Motivated
   Strategies for Learning Questionnaire) before the first examination and
   last examination. Most students experienced decreased test anxiety over
   the course of the semester; however, some students may have experienced
   performance limiting conditions due to test anxiety at the end of the
   semester based on academic ability in the course (in C students when
   compared to A students: P<0.00006 and B students: P<0.05), overall
   academic ability (in academically weaker students: P<0.025), and
   demographic factors (in women: P<0.025). The strongest performances on
   examinations were primarily observed in already academically strong
   students (mean individual performance: P<0.000, mean group performance:
   P<0.000). Furthermore, changes in test anxiety were not significantly
   associated with the group portion of the examinations. Patterns of
   changes in test anxiety over the course of the semester underscore a
   complex interaction between test anxiety, student background, and
   student performance. Results suggest that pathways for test anxiety in
   high stakes courses may be separate from the mechanisms responsible for
   the benefits of collaborative testing. Anat Sci Educ 10: 409-422. (c)

Abstract = {Computation offloading at mobile edge computing (MEC) servers can
   mitigate the resource limitation and reduce the communication latency
   for mobile devices. Thereby, in this study, we proposed an offloading
   model for a multi-user MEC system with multi-task. In addition, a new
   caching concept is introduced for the computation tasks, where the
   application program and related code for the completed tasks are cached
   at the edge server. Furthermore, an efficient model of task offloading
   and caching integration is formulated as a nonlinear problem whose goal
   is to reduce the total overhead of time and energy. However, solving
   these types of problems is computationally prohibitive, especially for
   large-scale of mobile users. Thus, an equivalent form of reinforcement
   learning is created where the state spaces are defined based on all
   possible solutions and the actions are defined on the basis of movement
   between the different states. Afterwards, two effective Q-learning and
   Deep-Q-Network-based algorithms are proposed to derive the near-optimal
   solution for this problem. Finally, experimental evaluations verify that
   our proposed model can substantially minimize the mobile devices'
   overhead by deploying computation offloading and task caching strategy
   reasonably.},

Abstract = {The Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) and the Science Writing and Workshop
   Template (SWWT) are two active learning instructional approaches which
   combine writing inquiry, collaboration, and reflection, elements which
   have been associated with critical thinking development. In this study,
   we used a quasi-experimental pretest post-test design to investigate the
   impact of the implementation of these two approaches on the critical
   thinking skills of first-year chemistry students, measured using the
   California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST). The results indicate
   that implementation of the PLTL and the SWWT instructional strategies
   led to significantly higher gains in critical thinking.},

Abstract = {Teacher education programs have been tasked with the responsibility to
   develop educators who can successfully infuse technology into their
   teaching. Despite standards-based expectations, a plethora of technology
   infusion opportunities, and the importance of faculty roles as models
   and teachers, physical education teacher education (PETE) programs have
   yet to demonstrate current expectations for teaching with and about
   educational technology. In this article, the authors provide a glimpse
   into the educational technology requirements, challenges, and strategies
   for teacher education/PETE programs. The authors suggest a call to
   action among PETE programs to address the issues that prevent PETE
   graduates from entering their teaching careers less than equipped to
   effectively use technology to enhance teaching and learning.},

Abstract = {A smart energy management controller can improve energy efficiency, save
   energy costs, and reduce carbon emissions and energy consumption while
   accurately catering to consumer consumption habits. Having integrated
   various renewable energy systems (RESs) and a battery storage system
   (BSS), we proposed an optimization-based demand-side management (DSM)
   scheduler and energy management controller (SEMC) for a smart home. The
   suggested SEMC creates a DSM-based operational plan regarding
   user-centered and comfort-aware preferences. Using the generated
   appliances operation plan, consumers can reduce energy costs, carbon
   emissions, peak-to-average ratio (PAR), improve their comfort in terms
   of thermal, illumination, and appliances usage preferences. A schedule
   for residential consumers is suggested using ant colony optimization
   (ACO), teaching learning-based optimization (TLBO), Jaya algorithm,
   rainfall algorithm, firefly algorithm, and our hybrid ACO and TLBO
   optimization (ACTLBO) algorithm. Five existing algorithms-based
   frameworks validate the DSM framework that relies on ACTLBO. The results
   validate that the integration of RESs and BSS, and adapting our proposed
   algorithm and SEMC under demand response program real-time price reduced
   the energy bill costs, PAR and CO2 in Case I: only external grid (EG)
   usage by 42.14\%, 22.05\%, and 28.33\%, in Case II: EG with RESs by
   21.79\%, 11.27\%, 17.02\%, and in Case III: EG with RESs and BSS by
   28.76\%, 41.53\%, 21.86\%, respectively as compared to without employing
   SEMC. Moreover, the user-comfort (UC) improvement index-ratio with
   scheduling using ACTLBO is 7.77\%, 24.73\%, 5.00\%, and 3.43\% in
   aspects of indoor air quality, average delay, thermal, and visual,
   respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed DSM-based
   framework outperforms existing frameworks to reduce energy cost, reduce
   carbon emission, mitigate peak loads, and improve UC.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To construct and pilot an educational tool to improve the
   quality of postoperative documentation at Mayo University Hospital.
   DESIGN: Retrospective data were collected from 100 consecutive patients
   treated surgically during October to November 2016. The first written
   ward based note following surgery was analyzed against RCS quality
   standards outlined in ``Good Surgical Practice.{''} An educational tool
   was then constructed to improve postoperative documentation. The
   mnemonic created was POST-OP physiotherapy/mobilization, operative
   diagnosis, sepsis, thromboprophylaxis, oral intake/fluid balance, and
   pain. A second audit cycle involving 103 patients was carried out
   prospectively in March 2017.
   SETTING: Mayo University Hospital, a 330 bed teaching hospital
   affiliated with the National University of Ireland, Galway.
   PARTICIPANTS: All patients who had undergone either an elective or an
   emergency general surgery procedure over two 5-week periods.
   RESULTS: Comparing the 2 study periods, significant improvements in the
   quality of postoperative surgical documentation was observed. All
   standards improved including patient identification (17.8\% vs 78.1\%, p
   < 0.001) and name of note maker (54.7\% vs 86.2\%, p < 0.001). There was
   also improvement in the documentation of antibiotic use (23.8\% vs
   75.8\%, p > 0.001), thromboprophylaxis (7.1\% vs 75.8\%, p < 0.001),
   analgesia (36.9\% vs 74.7\%, p < 0.001), operative diagnosis (66.6\% vs
   91.9\%, p < 0.001), and mobilization (23.6\% vs 78.1\%, p < 0.001)
   following the introduction of the POST-OP tool.
   CONCLUSION: The design and introduction of the POST-OP education tool
   helped to significantly improve documentation and educate surgical
   residents on the essential components of postoperative care. The above
   data suggest that this effective mnemonic can improve the quality of
   postoperative documentation for surgical patients. (C) 2018 Association

Abstract = {This study explores the acid base topic in the context of a chemistry
   course taken as a prerequisite for a baccalaureate nursing program. Core
   findings were derived from semistructured interviews with experts in the
   areas of chemistry and nursing, and a multiple university survey of
   experts' opinions. The acid base topic was reviewed and evaluated in
   several general, organic, and biological (GOB) chemistry textbooks and
   nursing textbooks. A set of acid base chemistry concepts were identified
   that have relevance in the allied-health fields, especially nursing. By
   being aware of these concepts, the GOB chemistry instructors can better
   plan their learning activities, teaching strategies, and assessment.},

Abstract = {Objective To identify implementation lessons from the United Kingdom
   Delivering Assisted Living Lifestyles at Scale (dallas) program-a
   large-scale, national technology program that aims to deliver a broad
   range of digital services and products to the public to promote health
   and wellbeing.
   Materials and Methods Prospective, longitudinal qualitative research
   study investigating implementation processes. Qualitative data collected
   includes semi-structured e-Health Implementation Toolkit-led interviews
   at baseline/mid-point (n = 38), quarterly evaluation, quarterly
   technical and barrier and solutions reports, observational logs,
   quarterly evaluation alignment interviews with project leads,
   observational data collected during meetings, and ethnographic data from
   dallas events (n>200 distinct pieces of qualitative data). Data analysis
   was guided by Normalization Process Theory, a sociological theory that
   aids conceptualization of implementation issues in complex healthcare
   settings.
   Results Five key challenges were identified: 1) The challenge of
   establishing and maintaining large heterogeneous, multi-agency
   partnerships to deliver new models of healthcare; 2) The need for
   resilience in the face of barriers and set-backs including the backdrop
   of continually changing external environments; 3) The inherent tension
   between embracing innovative co-design and achieving delivery at pace
   and at scale; 4) The effects of branding and marketing issues in
   consumer healthcare settings; and 5) The challenge of interoperability
   and information governance, when commercial proprietary models are
   dominant.
   Conclusions The magnitude and ambition of the dallas program provides a
   unique opportunity to investigate the macro level implementation
   challenges faced when designing and delivering digital health and
   wellness services at scale. Flexibility, adaptability, and resilience
   are key implementation facilitators when shifting to new digitally
   enabled models of care.},

Abstract = {PurposeLenders in online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms are always
   non-experts and face severe information asymmetry. This paper aims to
   achieve the goals of gaining high returns with risk limitations or
   lowering risks with expected returns for P2P
   lenders.Design/methodology/approachThis paper used data from a leading
   online P2P lending platform in America. First, the authors constructed a
   logistic regression-based credit scoring model and a linear
   regression-based profit scoring model to predict the default
   probabilities and profitability of loans. Second, based on the
   predictions of loan risk and loan return, the authors constructed linear
   programming model to form the optimal loan portfolio for
   lenders.FindingsThe research results show that compared to a logistic
   regression-based credit scoring method, the proposed new framework could
   make more returns for lenders with risks unchanged. Furthermore,
   compared to a linear regression-based profit scoring method, the
   proposed new framework could lower risks for lenders without lowering
   returns. In addition, comparisons with advanced machine learning
   techniques further validate its superiority.Originality/valueUnlike
   previous studies that focus solely on predicting the default probability
   or profitability of loans, this study considers loan allocation in
   online P2P lending as an optimization research problem using a new
   framework based upon modern portfolio theory (MPT). This study may
   contribute theoretically to the extension of MPT in the specific context
   of online P2P lending and benefit lenders and platforms to develop more
   efficient investment tools.},

Abstract = {Emerging smart grid infrastructures are allowing buildings to connect to
   components in other buildings and utilize them in different ways.
   Clearly, these interconnected building clusters provide new
   opportunities for building operators to collaborate and help reduce
   their operational costs over a planning horizon. Nevertheless, since
   each building can be treated as an independent decision maker here,
   related fairness concerns have to be addressed in these collaborative
   environments. We address these issues on building clusters when a single
   electrical energy storage is shared between two buildings with
   deterministic demand. We introduce three energy storage sharing
   strategies, and develop a bi-objective mathematical formulation for each
   strategy. Several techniques such as piecewise McCormick relaxation are
   employed for linearizing non-linear terms in the proposed formulations.
   An extensive computational study demonstrates the efficacy of our
   proposed linearization techniques, and compares all three strategies in
   terms of fairness and freedom. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Optimal power flow (OPF) refers to the problem of optimizing the
   operating decisions such as electric power generation in power systems,
   which are always subjected to dynamic factors like bus loads.
   Conventionally, OPF in dynamic environments has been solved by
   static-oriented optimization methods based on the prediction of the
   dynamic factors. However, as the dynamics of modern power systems become
   more and more complex and difficult to predict, research interest of
   intelligent methods that track the optimal decisions of OPF has been
   grown recently. Devoted to this objective, a learning enhanced
   differential evolution (LEDE) is proposed in this paper. LEDE
   incorporates the idea of nearest-neighbor rule from the field of machine
   learning, with which decisions of the previous environments are
   retrieved continually to replace the newly generated individuals of
   differential evolution. A so-called elitism stochastic ranking strategy
   is also proposed, used in LEDE to handle constraints of OPF. Experiments
   are conducted on the dynamic IEEE 30-bus system and IEEE 118-bus system,
   and the results show the efficiency of LEDE in comparison with other
   algorithms. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The integration of engineering content at the pre-college level is
   gaining global traction as a strategy to improve learning outcomes and
   to promote inclusion and diversity in STEM (Science, Technology,
   Engineering, and Mathematics). Preservice teacher (PST) programs have
   become natural insertion points for integration efforts by providing
   future K-12 teachers with the resources and preparation to teach
   engineering as part of their academic preparation. There is a need to
   understand the socio-cognitive mechanisms by which teacher preparation
   programs can help teachers to integrate engineering in their future
   classrooms. This work examines how an innovative cross-disciplinary
   program impacted important social-cognitive drivers of engineering
   integration. We used mediation analysis to understand a successful
   pathway to engineering integration as a result of exposure to a
   cross-disciplinary collaboration with engineering students. This study
   revealed how participation in the program as part of their academic
   preparation increased PSTs' confidence to teach engineering and their
   beliefs about the importance of engineering content, which in turn,
   increased their intention to integrate engineering in the classroom.},

Title = {The food diary as a pedagogical strategy in undergraduate nursing
   nutrition education: A student evaluation},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {98},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: Few studies have evaluated educational nutrition activities
   in undergraduate nursing, and none have published how the established
   food assessment method, the food diary, can be used as a pedagogical
   method in this context. Objective: To describe undergraduate nursing
   students' learning outcomes of basic nutrition and important elements
   for their learning after conducting a one-day food record with a
   subsequent seminar (henceforth: ``the food diary method{''}). Design:
   Cross-sectional. Setting: Undergraduate nursing program in Sweden.
   Participants: 161 students. Methods: Participants conducted a one-day
   food record by documenting their food intake and calculating the
   nutritional values. After completion, students participated in a
   seminar, and an evaluative questionnaire was distributed at the end. The
   questionnaires contained both numerical and free-text questions.
   Results: Of 162 students attending the seminar, all but one completed
   the questionnaire (response rate: 99\%). The highest rated learning
   outcome, on the 5-point Likert scale, was an increased understanding for
   the nutritional recommendations (Median, M = 5). The highest rated
   educational aspects were that they compared their records with the
   nutritional recommendations (M = 5), and the calculations of nutritional
   values of their records (M = 5). Participants also indicated that they
   gained information that would be useful for them as practicing nurses (M
   = 5). Conclusions: Overall, the food diary method appeared to be a
   feasible method in educating and engaging undergraduate nursing students
   in the field of basic nutrition. These findings support results from
   previous studies in this area, such that educational nutrition
   activities that utilize active, experiential, and social learning
   strategies were appreciated by the students.},

Title = {An analysis of engineering students' risk perception to support process
   safety learning process},
Journal = {EDUCATION FOR CHEMICAL ENGINEERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {7-19},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Multidisciplinary teams often undertake engineering projects beyond
   their original discipline involving different kinds of risks. Risk
   perception is an inherent and embedded part of the decision-making
   process, which depends on the personal background and instinctive
   attitudes or behaviors. Process safety and risk analysis training for
   engineers, and education for engineering students, provide valuable
   tools seeking safer workplaces; however, personnel's risk perception is
   commonly neglected. This paper analyzes the risk perception and appetite
   of undergraduate engineering students in Colombia based on a survey
   strategy and a weighted-approach following a Factor Analysis. The survey
   considered financial, social, physical, and professional risks, and four
   main reasons for risk-taking or risk-avoiding actions. The Factor
   Analysis allows us to classify the students tendency as risk -averse o
   risk-prone, and propose didactic teaching planning using a modular
   toolbox for process safety educa-tion, based on skills identified for
   junior engineers in Colombian Oil \& Gas Industry. A total of 465
   engineering students from 12 Colombian universities completed the survey
   in 2016. The results suggest that risk perception depends on the
   location, possible risk training, and accessible information. The
   obtained factors allow describing the students' overall risk profiles,
   which can serve as an input for refining the content and curriculum
   content of current engineering programs regarding process safety.
   Improving the training of risk management in the en-gineering curriculum
   will benefit upcoming multidisciplinary teams in high-risk industries.},

Abstract = {Motivation: A major goal of personalized medicine in oncology is the
   optimization of treatment strategies given measurements of the genetic
   and molecular profiles of cancer cells. To further our knowledge on drug
   sensitivity, machine learning techniques are commonly applied to cancer
   cell line panels.
   Results: We present a novel integer linear programming formulation,
   called MEthod for Rule Identification with multi-omics DAta (MERIDA),
   for predicting the drug sensitivity of cancer cells. The method
   represents a modified version of the LOBICO method and yields easily
   interpretable models amenable to a Boolean logic-based interpretation.
   Since the proposed altered logical rules lead to an enormous
   acceleration of the running times of MERIDA compared to LOBICO, we
   cannot only consider larger input feature sets integrated from genetic
   and molecular omics data but also build more comprehensive models that
   mirror the complexity of cancer initiation and progression. Moreover, we
   enable the inclusion of a priori knowledge that can either stem from
   biomarker databases or can also be newly acquired knowledge gathered
   iteratively by previous runs of MERIDA. Our results show that this
   approach does not only lead to an improved predictive performance but
   also identifies a variety of putative sensitivity and resistance
   biomarkers. We also compare our approach to state-of-the-art machine
   learning methods and demonstrate the superior performance of our method.
   Hence, MERIDA has great potential to deepen our understanding of the
   molecular mechanisms causing drug sensitivity or resistance.

Abstract = {This article proposes a reinforcement-learning (RL) approach for
   optimizing charging scheduling and pricing strategies that maximize the
   system objective of a public electric vehicle (EV) charging station. The
   proposed algorithm is x201C;onlinex201D; in the sense that the charging
   and pricing decisions made at each time depend only on the observation
   of past events, and is x201C;model-freex201D; in the sense that the
   algorithm does not rely on any assumed stochastic models of uncertain
   events. To cope with the challenge arising from the time-varying
   continuous state and action spaces in the RL problem, we first show that
   it suffices to optimize the total charging rates to fulfill the charging
   requests before departure times. Then, we propose a feature-based linear
   function approximator for the statex2013;value function to further
   enhance the efficiency and generalization ability of the proposed
   algorithm. Through numerical simulations with real-world data, we show
   that the proposed RL algorithm achieves on average 138.5x0025; higher
   charging-station profit than representative benchmark algorithms.},

Abstract = {BackgroundHealth outcomes of Indigenous patients are impacted by
   culturally unsafe specialty care environments. The `Educating for Equity
   (E4E)' program is a continuing professional development (CPD)
   intervention which incorporates skill-based teaching to improve
   Indigenous patient experiences and outcomes in healthcare
   interactions.MethodsThe E4E program was delivered to rheumatologists in
   two phases, each delivered as experiential learning workshops where
   participants engaged with and applied course content within an
   interactive format focusing on real-time feedback. The phase 1 workshop
   focused on skill development of E4E Framework concepts and principles.
   Phase 2 concentrated on building capacity for teaching of E4E content.
   Evaluation of the program's effectiveness was through longitudinal
   responses to the Social Cultural Confidence in Care Survey (SCCCS),
   self-reported strategies employed to address social issues and improve
   therapeutic relationships, engagement with teaching others, and
   satisfaction with the program.ResultsTwo cohorts of participants have
   participated in the program (n=24 Phase 1, n=10 Phase 2). For
   participants completing both phases of training, statistically
   significant improvements were observed in exploring social factors with
   patients, gaining knowledge and skills related to cultural aspects of
   care, improved communication and relationship building, and reflections
   on held stereotypes. Strategies to address social issues and build
   therapeutic relationships remained consistent throughout participation,
   while the training enhanced exploration and confidence to ask about
   cultural and traditional practices, and stronger communication
   strategies for exploring beliefs, expectations, social barriers, and
   residential school impacts on health. Participants reported feeling
   prepared to teach Indigenous health concepts to others and subsequently
   lead teaching with residents, fellows, and allied health professionals.
   Satisfaction with the delivery and content of the workshops was high,
   and participants valued interactions with peers in
   learning.ConclusionsThis CPD intervention had a beneficial impact on
   self-reported confidence and enhanced practice strategies to engage with
   Indigenous patients.},

Title = {Exploring one aspect of pedagogical content knowledge of teaching
   assistants using the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {The Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM) has been used
   to assess student understanding of introductory concepts of electricity
   and magnetism because many of the items on the CSEM have strong
   distractor choices which correspond to students' alternate conceptions.
   Instruction is unlikely to be effective if instructors do not know the
   common alternate conceptions of introductory physics students and
   explicitly take into account common student difficulties in their
   instructional design. Here, we discuss research involving the CSEM to
   evaluate one aspect of the pedagogical content knowledge of teaching
   assistants (TAs): knowledge of introductory students' alternate
   conceptions in electricity and magnetism as revealed by the CSEM. For
   each item on the CSEM, the TAs were asked to identify the most common
   incorrect answer choice selected by introductory physics students if
   they did not know the correct answer after traditional instruction.
   Then, we used introductory student CSEM post-test data to assess the
   extent to which TAs were able to identify the most common alternate
   conception of introductory students in each question on the CSEM. We
   find that the TAs were thoughtful when attempting to identify common
   student difficulties and they enjoyed learning about student
   difficulties this way. However, they struggled to identify many common
   difficulties of introductory students that persist after traditional
   instruction. We discuss specific alternate conceptions that persist
   after traditional instruction, the extent to which TAs were able to
   identify them, and results from think-aloud interviews with TAs which
   provided valuable information regarding why the TAs sometimes selected
   certain alternate conceptions as the most common but were instead very
   rare among introductory students. We also discuss how tasks such as the
   one used in this study can be used in professional development programs
   to engender productive discussions about the importance of being
   knowledgeable about student alternate conceptions in order to help
   students learn. Interviews with TAs engaged in this task as well as our
   experience with such tasks in our professional development programs
   suggest that they are beneficial.},

Abstract = {In many countries, computer programming is becoming an integral part of
   the secondary school curriculum. However, many teachers, especially in
   the first years of Flemish secondary school, have limited experience
   with teaching programming. To improve their knowledge about programming,
   many different types of professional development programs have been
   proposed. Nevertheless, these programs mostly focus on technical skills
   and less on pedagogical skills. One aspect that is often overlooked in
   these programs is how teachers can assess code. To get insight into what
   teachers currently value when assessing code, we designed an experiment
   that analyzes the different aspects teachers consider during the
   assessment of code. During the experiment, the teachers (N=13) assess a
   set of programs from five different fictional learners. After the
   assessment, they participated in a semi-structured interview, giving us
   insight into the assessment process. We evaluated the transcripts of the
   interviews using deductive thematic analysis using a coding schema
   defining the different aspects of code that can be assessed.
   Additionally, we linked the assessment strategies of teachers to their
   teaching experience. Our results indicate that many teachers are unaware
   of the different concepts that can be part of the assessment of code,
   which might lead to inaccurate or invalid feedback. Moreover, although
   our experimental group was too small to draw hard conclusions about the
   inter-case results, our results indicate that the number of concepts
   considered by teachers seems to increase with experience. These results
   provide an initial insight into the code assessment practices of
   teachers and reveals interesting pathways for future research into the
   assessment of code.},

Abstract = {Due to the fast transmission speed and severe health damage, COVID-19
   has attracted global attention. Early diagnosis and isolation are
   effective and imperative strategies for epidemic prevention and control.
   Most diagnostic methods for the COVID-19 is based on nucleic acid
   testing (NAT), which is expensive and time-consuming. To build an
   efficient and valid alternative of NAT, this article investigates the
   feasibility of employing computed tomography images of lungs as the
   diagnostic signals. Unlike normal lungs, parts of the lungs infected
   with the COVID-19 developed lesions, ground-glass opacity, and
   bronchiectasis became apparent. Through a public dataset, in this
   article, we propose an advanced residual learning diagnosis detection
   (RLDD) scheme for the COVID-19 technique, which is designed to
   distinguish positive COVID-19 cases from heterogeneous lung images.
   Besides the advantage of high diagnosis effectiveness, the designed
   residual-based COVID-19 detection network can efficiently extract the
   lung features through small COVID-19 samples, which removes the
   pretraining requirement on other medical datasets. In the test set, we
   achieve an accuracy of 91.33\%, a precision of 91.30\%, and a recall of
   90\%. For the batch of 150 samples, the assessment time is only 4.7 s.
   Therefore, RLDD can be integrated into the application programming
   interface and embedded into the medical instrument to improve the
   detection efficiency of COVID-19.},

Abstract = {In 2015, the Pritzker School of Medicine experienced increasing student
   interest in the changing sociopolitical landscape of the United States
   and the interaction of these events with student and patient identity.
   To address this interest, an Identity and Inclusion Steering Committee
   was formed and formally charged with ``providing ongoing direction for
   programs and/or curricula at Pritzker that support an inclusive learning
   environment and promote respectful and effective communication with
   diverse patients and colleagues around issues of identity.{''} The
   authors describe this committee's structure and steps taken by the
   committee to create an inclusive community of students at Pritzker
   characterized by learning through civil discourse. Initiatives were
   guided by a strategy of continuous quality improvement consisting of
   regular iterative evaluation, ongoing school-wide engagement, and
   responsiveness to issues and concerns as they emerged. Data collected
   over the committee's 4-year existence demonstrate significant
   improvement in students' sense of inclusion and respect for different
   perspectives on issues related to identity, such as access to health
   care, racialized medicine, safe spaces, and nursing labor strikes. The
   authors discuss several principles that support the development of an
   inclusive community of students as well as challenges to the
   implementation of such programming. They conclude that a strategy of
   continuous quality improvement guided by values of social justice,
   tolerance, and civil discourse can build community inclusion and enhance
   medical training for the care of diverse patient populations.},

Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTING EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},

Number = {4},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article presents two case studies aimed at exploring the use of
   self-explanations in the context of computational science and
   engineering (CSE) education. The self-explanations were elicited as
   students' in-code comments of a set of worked-examples, and the cases
   involved two different approaches to CSE education: glass box and black
   box. The glass-box approach corresponds to a programming course for
   materials science and engineering students that focuses on introducing
   programming concepts while solving disciplinary problems. The black-box
   approach involves the introduction of Python-based computational tools
   within a thermodynamics course to represent disciplinary phenomena. Two
   semesters of data collection for each case study allowed us to identify
   the effect of using in-code comments as a self-explanation strategy on
   students' engagement with the worked-examples and students' perceptions
   of these activities within each context. The results suggest that the
   use of in-code comments as a self-explanation strategy increased
   students' awareness of the worked-examples while engaging with them. The
   students' perceived uses of the in-code commenting activities include:
   understanding the example, making a connection between the programming
   code and the disciplinary problem, and becoming familiar with the
   programming language syntax, among others.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a framework for faculty development in continuing
   interprofessional education (CIPE) and collaborative practice. The
   framework is built on best practices in faculty development and CIPE. It
   was informed by local experience in the development, delivery, and
   evaluation of a faculty development program to promote capacity for
   dissemination of concepts relating to interprofessional education (IPE)
   and interprofessional collaboration (IPC) in health care environments.
   Interprofessional education has been demonstrated in clinical contexts
   to enhance interprofessional collaboration, patient care, and health
   outcomes. With curriculum design, teaching methods, and educational
   strategies in faculty development, it is possible to enhance the impact
   of IPE in clinical contexts. Faculty development activities themselves
   can model effective interprofessional education methods and practice. An
   IPE curriculum and teaching and education strategies are outlined.
   Strategic planning, including the application of a systems approach,
   attention to the principles of effective learning, and an outcomes-based
   curriculum design are recommended for the development of continuing IPE
   faculty development programs that enhance interprofessional
   collaboration.},

Abstract = {Regulatory frameworks around the world mandate that health and social
   care professional education programs graduate practitioners who have the
   competence and capability to practice effectively in interprofessional
   collaborative teams. Academic institutions are responding by offering
   interprofessional education (IPE); however, there is as yet no consensus
   regarding optimal strategies for the assessment of interprofessional
   learning (IPL). The Program Committee for the 17th Ottawa Conference in
   Perth, Australia in March, 2016, invited IPE champions to debate and
   discuss the current status of the assessment of IPL. A draft statement
   from this workshop was further discussed at the global All Together
   Better Health VIII conference in Oxford, UK in September, 2016. The
   outcomes of these deliberations and a final round of electronic
   consultation informed the work of a core group of international IPE
   leaders to develop this document. The consensus statement we present
   here is the result of the synthesized views of experts and global
   colleagues. It outlines the challenges and difficulties but endorses a
   set of desired learning outcome categories and methods of assessment
   that can be adapted to individual contexts and resources. The points of
   consensus focus on pre-qualification (pre-licensure) health professional
   students but may be transferable into post-qualification arenas.},

Abstract = {Background Content knowledge surrounding transgender (trans) medicine is
   currently lacking in the formal medical education curricula. Evidence
   indicates that the main protocols used to assess and refer trans
   patients for gender-affirming medicine are misunderstood by health
   professionals, and require flexible adaptation to achieve health equity
   and patient-centred care. Approach A free online educational tool for
   gender-affirming medicine, The Path to Patient-Centred Care, was
   developed to teach learners how to adapt assessment protocols. Resource
   creation was supported by a knowledge translation grant that endorsed
   design thinking, a human-centred and solutions-focused framework
   recommended for use in curriculum development. Evaluation The Path to
   Patient-Centred Care provides learners with information related to key
   principles of patient-centred care in gender-affirming medicine,
   including a guide on how to adapt the main assessment protocols to
   achieve equitable care. The curriculum also includes narratives from
   trans patients and health professionals that focus on health equity, and
   a clinical vignette about a complex case, designed to foster critical
   thinking on medical ethics. Project future directions involve an
   implementation and evaluation pilot study with a diverse group of
   continuing professional development medical learners using a
   mixed-methods program evaluation design. Reflection The use of design
   thinking to develop this resource exemplifies a novel approach to
   curriculum development. By using pedagogical strategies that foster
   critical reflection, this innovative online education tool strives to
   teach self-directed learners how to provide care that emphasizes trans
   people's self-determination and autonomy in medical decision-making.},

Title = {Learner Deficits and Academic Outcomes of Medical Students, Residents,

Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {89},

Abstract = {Purpose To identify deficit types and predictors of poor academic
   outcomes among students, residents, fellows, and physicians referred to
   the University of Colorado School of Medicine's remediation program.
   Method During 2006-2012, 151 learners were referred. After a
   standardized assessment process, program faculty developed
   individualized learning plans that incorporated deliberate practice,
   feedback, and reflection, followed by independent reassessment. The
   authors collected data on training levels, identified deficits,
   remediation plan details, outcomes, and faculty time invested. They
   examined relationships between gender, training level, and specific
   deficits. They analyzed faculty time by deficit and explored predictors
   of negative outcomes.
   Results Most learners had more than one deficit; medical knowledge,
   clinical reasoning, and professionalism were most common. Medical
   students were more likely than others to have mental well-being issues
   (P = .03), whereas the prevalence of professionalism deficits increased
   steadily as training level increased. Men struggled more than women with
   communication (P = .01) and mental well-being. Poor professionalism was
   the only predictor of probationary status (P < .001), and probation was
   a predictor of other negative outcomes (P < .0001). Remediation of
   clinical reasoning and mental well-being deficits required significantly
   more faculty time (P < .001 and P = .03, respectively). Per hour,
   faculty face time reduced the odds of probation by 3.1\% (95\% CI,
   0.09-0.63) and all negative outcomes by 2.6\% (95\% CI, 0.96-0.99).
   Conclusions Remediation required substantial resources but was
   successful for 90\% of learners. Future studies should compare
   remediation strategies and assess how to optimize faculty time.},

Title = {Towards the use of vector based GP to predict physiological time series},
Journal = {APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {89},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Prediction of physiological time series is frequently approached by
   means of machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, most ML techniques
   are not able to directly manage time series, thus they do not exploit
   all the useful information such as patterns, peaks and regularities
   provided by the time dimension. Besides advanced ML methods such as
   recurrent neural network that preserve the ordered nature of time
   series, a recently developed approach of genetic programming, VE-GP,
   looks promising on the problem in analysis. VE-GP allows time series as
   terminals in the form of a vector, including new strategies to exploit
   this representation. In this paper we compare different ML techniques on
   the real problem of predicting ventilation flow from physiological
   variables with the aim of highlighting the potential of VE-GP.
   Experimental results show the advantage of applying this technique in
   the problem and we ascribe the good performances to the ability of
   properly catching meaningful information from time series. (C) 2020

Abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) education in K-12 requires extensive teacher
   development. This research investigates the effectiveness of a scalable
   and sustainable teacher development pro-gramme in promoting CT in
   primary education. This report presents two studies. Study 1 reports on
   the effectiveness of two 12-h courses using Scratch and App Inventor
   programming environ-ments for CT development of teachers respectively,
   which involved 245 teachers from 47 primary schools. With teaching
   practices embedded, the programme, which used the framework of
   technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK), significantly
   enhanced teachers' content -related knowledge dimensions. The results
   indicate that the programme helped teachers develop advanced CT concepts
   such as data structures and procedures. Study 2, using thematic
   analysis, reports on CT strategies implemented in 47 schools through 94
   school visits. The most mentioned strategies were the formation of
   teaching teams, lesson co-planning, and the integration of CT with
   subject teaching. The most mentioned challenges were teacher readiness,
   lesson time, and diversity - learners' abilities, interests, and
   approaches. Four types of support, including teacher development
   support, continuous and communal support, teaching materials support,
   and financial support were identified. The results suggest that a
   course-based programme with mixed programming environments and embedded
   teaching experience effectively develops teachers' capabilities.
   However, continuous support for teachers in implementing the initiative
   after completing the programme is important, especially in addressing
   learner diversity and integrating CT with subject teaching.},

Abstract = {Necroptosis, a programmed necrosis pathway, is witnessed in diverse
   human diseases and is primarily regulated by receptor-interacting
   serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and RIPK3. Ablation or
   inhibition of these individual proteins, or both, has been shown to be
   protective in various in vitro and in vivo disease models involving
   necroptosis. In this study, we propose an effective and rapid virtual
   screening strategy to identify multitarget inhibitors of both RIPK1 and
   RIPK3. It involves ensemble pharmacophore-based screening (EPS) of a
   compound database, post-EPS filtration (PEPSF) of the ligand hits, and
   multiple dockings. Structurally diverse inhibitors were identified
   through ensemble pharmacophore features, and the speed of this process
   was enhanced by filtering out the compounds containing cross-eatures.
   The stability of these inhibitors with both of the proteins was verified
   by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.},

Abstract = {Recent advances in laboratory automation and digitization require a
   teaching strategy for undergraduate students that is inclusive of skills
   in these areas so that students can be prepared to work within the
   modern laboratory. Future scientists will need training in coding,
   microcontrollers, on-demand manufacturing, and robotics. With this in
   mind, we aim to present a simple automated setup for use in
   undergraduate teaching, exposing and introducing these additional and
   integrative skillsets that the new generation of students, researchers,
   and teaching staff will need within the chemistry field. This automated
   setup performed the well-known synthesis of aspirin, which is often part
   of the traditional organic chemistry curriculum. Exposing students to
   simple laboratory automation is an important first step in preparing
   them to engage with the technology used in modern laboratories. This
   activity encourages students to think critically about applying
   automation within the laboratory and showed them the possibilities that
   a robotic-orientated workflow combined with programming, coding, and
   synthesis holds-a new world of exploration, collaboration, and
   expansion.},

Abstract = {Funding communities through mini-grant programs builds community
   capacity by fostering leadership among community members, developing
   expertise in implementing evidence-based practices, and increasing trust
   in partnerships. The South Carolina Cancer Prevention and Control
   Research Network (SC-CPCRN) implemented the Community Health
   Intervention Program (CHIP) mini-grants initiative to address
   cancer-related health disparities among high-risk populations in rural
   areas of the state. One community-based organization and one faith-based
   organization were funded during the most recent call for proposals. The
   organizations implemented National Cancer Institute evidence-based
   strategies and programs focused on health and cancer screenings and
   physical activity and promotion of walking trails. Despite the potential
   for the COVID-19 pandemic to serve as a major barrier to implementation,
   grantees successfully recruited and engaged community members in
   evidence-based activities. These initiatives added material benefits to
   their local communities, including promotion of walking outdoors where
   it is less likely to contract the virus when socially distanced and
   provision of COVID-19 testing and vaccines along with other health and
   cancer screenings. Future mini-grants programs will benefit from
   learning from current grantees' flexibility in program implementation
   during a pandemic as well as their intentional approach to modifying
   program aspects as needed.},

Abstract = {Background: In the time since the launch of a nationwide general health
   check-up and instruction program in Japan in 2008, interest in the
   formulation of an effective and efficient strategy to improve the
   participation rate has been growing. The aim of this study was to
   develop and evaluate models identifying those who are unlikely to
   undergo general health check-ups. We used machine-learning methods to
   select interventional targets more efficiently.
   Methods: We used information from a local government database of Japan.
   The study population included 7290 individuals aged 40-74 years who
   underwent at least one general health check-up between 2012 and 2015. We
   developed four predictive models based on the extreme gradient boosting
   (XGBoost), random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVMs), and
   logistic regression (LR) algorithms, using machine-learning techniques,
   and compared the areas under the curves (AUCs) of the models with those
   of the heuristic method (which presumes that the individuals who
   underwent a general health check-up in the previous year will do so
   again in the following year).
   Results: The AUCs for the XGBoost, RF, SVMs, LR, and heuristic
   models/method were 0.829 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 0.806-0.853),
   0.821 (95\% CI: 0.797-0.845), 0.812 (95\% CI: 0.787-0.837), 0.816 (95\%
   CI: 0.791-0.841), and 0.683 (95\% CI: 0.657-0.708), respectively.
   XGBoost model exhibited the best AUC, and the performance was
   significantly better than that of SVMs (p = 0.034), LR (p = 0.017), and
   heuristic method (p < 0.001). However, the performance of XGBoost did
   not differ significantly from that of RF (p = 0.229).
   Conclusion: Predictive models using machine-learning techniques
   outperformed the existing heuristic method when used to predict
   participation in a general health check-up system by eligible
   participants. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract = {BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, face-to-face teaching and
   learning of physiotherapy practical skills was limited. Asynchronous,
   remote training has been effective in development of clinical skills in
   some health professions. This study aimed to determine the effect of
   remote, asynchronous training and feedback on development of
   neurodynamic skills in physiotherapy students.MethodsLongitudinal
   repeated measurements study, across four training sessions. Participants
   engaged in a remote training program for development of upper limb
   neurodynamic techniques. In this sequential training, participants
   viewed the online tutorial, practiced independently, and uploaded a
   video of their performance for formative assessment and feedback from a
   trained instructor via a checklist and rubric.ResultsIntra-subject
   analyses of 60 third-year physiotherapy students showed that the target
   standard of performance, with no further significant change in scores,
   was attained following session 2 for the checklist and session 3 for the
   rubric. This shows that two sessions are required to learn the
   procedures, and three sessions yield further improvements in performance
   quality.ConclusionThe remote, asynchronous training and feedback model
   proved to be an effective strategy for students' development of
   neurodynamic testing skills and forms a viable alternative to in-person
   training. This study contributes to the future of acquiring
   physiotherapy clinical competencies when distance or hybrid practice is
   required.},

Title = {Prostate Cancer Ambassadors: Enhancing a Theory-Informed Training
   Program for Informed Decision-Making},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CANCER EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {Despite the high burden of prostate cancer in African American
   communities, there is a paucity of knowledge about prostate health. This
   paper describes the enhancement of a curriculum for training lay health
   advisors, called prostate cancer ambassadors, on informed
   decision-making for prostate cancer screening. Adult learning theory
   informed the structuring of the training sessions to be interactive,
   self-directed, and engaging. Trainings were developed in a manner that
   made the material relevant to the learners and encouraged co-learning.
   The research team developed strategies, such as using discussions and
   interactive activities, to help community members weigh the pros and
   cons of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening and to make an
   informed decision about screening. Furthermore, activities were
   developed to bolster four social cognitive theory constructs:
   observational learning, self-efficacy for presenting information to the
   community and for making an informed decision themselves, collective
   efficacy for presenting information to the community, and outcome
   expectations from those presentations. Games, discussions, and debates
   were included to make learning fun and encourage discovery. Practice
   sessions and team-building activities were designed to build
   self-efficacy for sharing information about informed decision-making.
   Topics added to the original curriculum included updates on prostate
   cancer screening, informed decision-making for screening, skills for
   being a lay health advisor, and ethics. This dynamic model and approach
   to lay health advisor (ambassador) training is flexible: while it was
   tailored for use with prostate cancer education, it can be adjusted for
   use with other types of cancer and even other diseases.},

Journal = {MEDICAL TEACHER},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUL 29},
Abstract = {Purpose We sought to design a micro-curriculum to structure supervised
   clinical placements for junior medical students within a variety of
   community-based settings of differing clinical disciplines. Given the
   gaps in the literature, this paper reflects on the opportunities and
   challenges of our design, implementation, and evaluation strategies in
   constructing an integrated task-based micro-curriculum for
   interprofessional community-based learning in year 2 of a four-year
   graduate entry program. Methods The design was informed by a systems
   thinking framework and guided by contemporary curricular theories on
   self-directed and interprofessional learning. Extensive consultations
   with stakeholders were undertaken. Alignment with relevant national
   level documents and curricular frameworks was ensured. Results The
   systems thinking approach provided first, an experience of applying
   thinking tools for a deeper understanding of how various parts of this
   micro-curriculum and subsystems should be integrated. Second, applying
   the toolkit uncovered tension points on which leverage could optimise
   future enhancements. Eighteen types of health professions were recruited
   including 105 general practitioners and 253 healthcare practitioners
   from a range of disciplines. Conclusion Systems thinking allows for the
   identification of various interacting elements within the curriculum to
   be considered as part of an integrated whole. Insights from this model
   could inform the design of similar innovative curricula.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a case study of a mutually beneficial, 18-month long
   industry and academia partnership engagement process to assist others in
   establishing similar relationships. The partnership highlighted began
   with a single, unfunded graduate class project for a team of six
   students. Within 18-months, the partnership grew to 45 classroom
   projects, senior project designs (including capstone projects), graduate
   theses and dissertations, collaborative vendor/student research, and
   student competitions. During the three years following the 18-month case
   study, the industry-academia partnership continued to grow and resulted
   in multiple industry-funded research projects led by university faculty.
   Lessons learned from the partnership include 10 research-based
   collaboration strategies ranging from short term, low cast classroom
   projects to high cost, long term funded programs as well as nine
   industry brand awareness strategies for recruiting via future employee
   pipelines within the university. These lessons also include 11 project
   engagement steps that faculty can use to grow future funding
   opportunities. These engagement steps range from focusing on recruiting
   the right contact and champion, understanding the sense of urgency in
   project execution, to sustaining long partnered collaborations.
   Furthermore, the case-study established the need for a ``bilingual{''}
   contact to support the communication between industry and academia
   partners.},

Abstract = {With the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, there is an
   urgent need for the discovery of further treatments for the coronavirus
   disease (COVID-19). Drug repurposing is one of the most rapid strategies
   for addressing this need, and numerous compounds have already been
   selected for in vitro testing by several groups. These have led to a
   growing database of molecules with in vitro activity against the virus.
   Machine learning models can assist drug discovery through prediction of
   the best compounds based on previously published data. Herein, we have
   implemented several machine learning methods to develop predictive
   models from recent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro inhibition data and used them to
   prioritize additional FDA-approved compounds for in vitro testing
   selected from our in-house compound library. From the compounds
   predicted with a Bayesian machine learning model, lumefantrine, an
   antimalarial was selected for testing and showed limited antiviral
   activity in cell-based assays while demonstrating binding (K-d 259 nM)
   to the spike protein using microscale thermophoresis. Several other
   compounds which we prioritized have since been tested by others and were
   also found to be active in vitro. This combined machine learning and in
   vitro testing approach can be expanded to virtually screen available
   molecules with predicted activity against SARS-CoV-2 reference WIVO4
   strain and circulating variants of concern. In the process of this work,
   we have created multiple iterations of machine learning models that can
   be used as a prioritization tool for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug discovery
   programs. The very latest model for SARS-CoV-2 with over 500 compounds
   is now freely available at www.assaycentrai.org.},

Title = {Online Optimization of Collaborative Web Service QoS Prediction Based on
   Approximate Dynamic Programming},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS},
Year = {2015},
Abstract = {More recently, with the increasing demand of web services on the World
   Wide Web used in the Internet of Things (IoTs), there has been a growing
   interest in the study of efficient web service quality evaluation
   approaches based on prediction strategies to obtain accurate
   quality-of-service (QoS) values. However, it is obvious that the web
   service quality changes significantly under the unpredictable network
   environment. Such changes impose very challenging obstacles to web
   service QoS prediction. Most of the traditional web service QoS
   prediction approaches are implemented only using a set of static model
   parameters with the help of designer's a priori knowledge. Unlike the
   traditional QoS prediction approaches, our algorithm in this paper is
   realized by incorporating approximate dynamic programming- (ADP-) based
   online parameter tuning strategy into the QoS prediction approach.
   Through online learning and optimization, the proposed approach provides
   the QoS prediction with automatic parameter tuning capability, and prior
   knowledge or identification of the prediction model is not required.
   Therefore, the near-optimal performance of QoS prediction can be
   achieved. Experimental studies are carried out to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed ADP-based prediction approach.},

Abstract = {Blockchain technologies allow the Internet of Things (IoT) to build
   trust among various interest parties. For the resource-limited IoT
   devices, offloading computation-intensive tasks (blockchain verification
   and mining tasks, and data process tasks) to edge servers for execution
   is considered as a promising solution in mobile-edge computing. However,
   conventional methods (such as linear programming or game theory) for the
   computation offloading problem cannot achieve long-term performance
   while the existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithms
   suffer from slow convergence, lack of robustness, and unstable
   performance. In this article, we propose a multiagent DRL framework to
   achieve long-term performance for cooperative computation offloading, in
   which a scatter network is adopted to improve its stability and league
   learning is introduced for agents to explore the environment
   collaboratively for fast convergence and robustness. First, we study the
   nonorthogonal multiple access-enabled cooperative computation offloading
   problem and formulate the joint problem as a Markov decision process by
   considering both the blockchain mining tasks and data processing tasks.
   Second, to avoid useless exploration and unstable performance, we
   initially train an intelligent agent represented by scatter networks
   using conventional expert strategies. Third, in order to enhance the
   performance, we subsequently establish a hierarchical league where
   agents collaborate with others to explore the environment. Finally, our
   experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm could perform better
   in terms of reducing energy cost and delay cost, and shortening almost
   60\% of the training time compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Surgeons often conduct difficult conversations with patients
   near the end of life, yet surgical education provides little formalized
   communication training. We developed a communication tool, Best
   Case/Worst Case, and trained surgeons using a one-onone resource
   intensive format that was effective but difficult to scale for
   widespread dissemination. We aimed to generate an implementation package
   to teach surgeons using fewer resources without sacrificing fidelity.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used the Replicating Effectiveness
   Programs framework to guide our implementation strategy and tested our
   intervention with 39 surgical residents at 4 institutions from September
   2016 to June 2017. The implementation package consisted of: (1)
   instructional video, (2) checklist to assess competence, (3) learner
   manual, and (4) instructor manual. We focused on 3 Correspondence:

   feasibility, fidelity, and acceptability to participants.
   RESULTS: Attendance rates ranged from 16\% to 75\%. Site leaders had
   little difficulty identifying suitable instructors; however, resident
   recruitment proved challenging. Sixty-nine percent of residents
   completed the post-training assessment and the mean score was 12.8
   (range 8-15) using the 15-point checklist. Across sites, 69\% strongly
   agreed that Best Case/Worst Case is better than how they usually
   approach high-stakes conversations and 100\% felt prepared to use the
   tool after training. Instructors reported that the training provided
   residents with the necessary skills to perform the fundamental elements
   of Best Case/Worst Case.
   CONCLUSIONS: Using implementation science we demonstrated that a
   resource intensive communication training intervention can be
   successfully modified for group learning and wide-scale dissemination.
   However, we identified barriers to implementation, including challenges
   with feasibility and programmatic buy-in that inform not only resident
   education but also communication skills training more broadly. (J Surg

Abstract = {In this paper, for achieving the discounted optimal feedback
   stabilization of a nonlinear overhead crane system, we establish an
   intelligent control strategy to obtain the solution of the corresponding
   Hamilton-Jacobi- Bellman equation. Specifically, neural networks are
   employed to serve as a necessary component to the control system, which
   exhibits strong online learning ability. A novel updating rule compared
   to the traditional adaptive critic algorithms is developed, which
   eliminates the requirement of the initial stabilizing controller and
   brings in unique advantages to the adaptive critic control design.
   Stability analysis of the closed-loop system based on the well-known
   Lyapunov approach and experimental simulation considering the nonlinear
   overhead dynamics with different case studies are performed to verify
   the effectiveness of the present control method both in theory and
   applications.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   To describe the residents who chose to train in teaching health centers
   (THCs), which are community-based ambulatory patient care sites that
   sponsor primary care residencies, and their intentions to practice in
   underserved settings.
   Method
   The authors surveyed all THC residents training in academic years
   2013-2014, 2014-2015, and 2015-2016, comparing their demographic
   characteristics with data for residents nationally, and examined THC
   residents' intentions to practice in underserved settings using logistic
   regression analysis.
   Results
   The overall survey response rate was 89\% (1,031/1,153). THC resident
   respondents were similar to residents nationally in family medicine,
   geriatrics, internal medicine, obstetrics-gynecology, pediatrics, and
   psychiatry in terms of gender, age, race, and ethnicity. Twenty-nine
   percent (283) of respondents came from a rural background, and 46\%
   (454) had an educationally and/or economically disadvantaged background.
   More than half (524; 55\%) intended to practice in an underserved
   setting on completion of their training. Respondents were more likely to
   intend to practice in an underserved area if they came from a rural
   background (odds ratio 1.58; 95\% confidence interval 1.08, 2.32) or
   disadvantaged background (odds ratio 2.81; 95\% confidence interval
   1.91, 4.13).
   Conclusions
   THCs attract residents from rural and/or disadvantaged backgrounds who
   seem to be more inclined to practice in underserved areas than those
   from urban and economically advantaged roots. THC residents' intentions
   to practice in underserved areas indicate that primary care training
   programs sponsored by community-based ambulatory patient care sites
   represent a promising strategy to improve the U.S. health care workforce
   distribution.},

Abstract = {Information systems (IS) innovation in healthcare is a contested area
   often characterized by complex and conflicted relationships among
   different stakeholders. In this paper, we provide a systematic
   understanding of the mechanisms through which various actors translate
   competing visions about health sector reforms into policy and action
   and, thus, generate contradictions in IS innovation. We argue that we
   can learn more about the source of such contradictions by examining how
   competing frames can affect IS innovation in healthcare. We adopt frame
   theory and rhetorical strategies analysis in the case of health sector
   reforms in Kenya and focus specifically on the deployment of health
   information systems (HIS). We make several contributions. First, we
   demonstrate that policy actors' adherence to the interests and values
   represented in a frame is important in determining the choice of a
   rhetorical strategy and its influence on policy transformation and IS
   innovation. Second, we develop an understanding of how technology
   mediates the rhetorical strategies of different actors. In particular,
   we demonstrate the role of technology in giving continuity to frames,
   which affects policy change and IS innovation.},

Abstract = {Anatomy education continues to evolve in health professional programs as
   curricula shift to competency-based models and contact hours decrease.
   These changes in curricula may significantly alter the learning
   environment for students. Importantly, changes in learning environment
   have been shown to impact student learning strategies and well-being. It
   follows, then, that an investigation of students' perceptions of the
   learning environment is key to understand the impact of modern anatomy
   curriculum alterations. The current pilot study evaluated the impact of
   modifying examination format on the learning environment of physical
   therapy students participating in a human cadaveric anatomy course. Two
   study cohorts of first year (entry-level) physical therapy students were
   invited to complete a preliminary learning environment questionnaire
   with 13 visual analog scale items and four short answer items. One study
   cohort was tested with a viva (oral) practical examination, and the
   other, with a bell-ringer practical examination. Analysis of
   quantitative items revealed two significant findings: physical therapy
   students in the bell-ringer cohort found it was more difficult to
   prepare for their examination, and that they had inadequate time to
   respond to questions compared to the viva cohort. Analysis of
   qualitative items revealed distinct themes that concerned physical
   therapy student learning environment specific to cadaveric anatomy.
   These results demonstrate that examination format can influence the
   learning environment of physical therapy students studying cadaveric
   anatomy. As a result, care needs to be taken to ensure that modernized
   curricula align the examination format to the method of instruction and
   the future application of students' knowledge in clinical practice.},

Abstract = {Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education has
   been identified as a keystone teaching and learning area for developing
   students' knowledge and skills on interdisciplinary critical thinking
   and problem solving (We use the term `interdisciplinary' because
   discipline knowledge and methods were integrated from different
   disciplines in the project that used a synthesis of approaches). The
   position held by various government, industry and education stakeholders
   is that STEM learning, through different stages of education, will
   enable students to achieve their full potential. Underpinning this
   research was a response to an expressed school community need
   articulated through a primary school Principal's desire to integrate
   STEM learning into the classroom. Consequently, three primary schools
   from the mid north coast and north coast regions, New South Wales (NSW),
   Australia were involved in this research. In particular, the project
   facilitated teacher professional learning through authentic teaching and
   learning experiences coupled with transferable teaching and assessment
   strategies for the classroom. The rural and remote settings of the
   schools was influential in the design of the program. The methodology
   drew on Technacy Genre Theory to frame the interdisciplinary learning
   domains: Science (hypothesis testing literacies); Technology (digital
   microscope and robotics literacies); Engineering (food systems and
   biotechnology literacies) and Mathematics (data collection and
   statistics literacies). The findings indicated the teachers benefited
   through the development of effective strategies that led to successful
   outcomes on interdisciplinary teaching and learning and built up their
   confidence, knowledge and skills involved in the implementation of a
   STEM program into their primary school classrooms.},

Title = {Reinforcement Learning-Based Near-Optimal Load Balancing for
   Heterogeneous LiFi WiFi Network},
Journal = {IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},

Pages = {3084-3095},

Abstract = {Owing to the nonoverlapping spectrum, light fidelity (LiFi) and WiFi
   technologies can coexist and form a heterogeneous LiFi WiFi network
   (HLWN). The performance of HLWN significantly depends upon the load
   balancing strategies. Since load balancing of HLWN is a nonconvex
   mixed-integer nonlinear programming optimization problem, it is
   mathematically intractable, and therefore, the conventional optimization
   methods fail to provide an optimal global solution. Although an optimal
   solution can be obtained using the exhaustive search method, it would be
   computationally complex. Therefore, in this article, a reinforcement
   learning (RL)-based algorithm is explored for solving the load balancing
   problem for the downlink HLWN at reasonably low complexity and near
   optimal performance. We have proposed three different reward functions
   for RL; the first and second reward functions work toward maximizing
   average network throughput and user satisfaction, respectively. The
   third reward function is designed to maximize the long-term system
   throughput and ensure at least 50\% user's satisfaction for all users.
   In order to study the effects of link aggregation on the system
   performance, this article considers two different types of receiver
   schemes, namely, single access point (SAP) and link aggregation (LA)
   scheme. While the SAP allows the user to receive data only from an SAP,
   the LA scheme allows the user to receive data simultaneously from both
   LiFi and WiFi AP. This article also includes effect of random
   orientation of the receiver device and handover overhead. Furthermore,
   concepts of domain knowledge have been included in this article to
   reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm. The proposed
   system performance is compared with the the following two benchmarks:
   received signal strength (RSS) and exhaustive search based on the
   computational complexity, average system throughput, and user
   satisfaction. It is shown that the proposed RL scheme outperforms the
   RSS scheme in average system throughput and user satisfaction. The RL
   scheme with an appropriate reward function provides a matching
   performance to the exhaustive search at reasonably low complexity.},

Abstract = {Issues associated with classroom technology integration have become an
   interest of various educational research communities worldwide. To guide
   research into teachers' integration of technology, several important
   theoretical frameworks have emerged recently, one of which is the
   Technological, Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) conceptual
   model. However, current research on methodological assessments adopting
   this model has indicated a need for developing a valid and reliable
   Arabic assessment for assessing Arabic-speaking secondary preservice
   teachers' TPACK. Therefore, an Arabic survey instrument was designed and
   administered to 350 secondary preservice teachers who were studying in a
   postgraduate teachers preparation program. The instrument includes 27
   items and can be gathered under 7 factors representing the conceptual
   framework domains. Confirmatory factor analyses provided evidence that
   the designed Arabic instrument is a reliable and valid assessment for
   determining the TPACK of secondary preservice teachers in the context of
   the study location. Recommendations and implications have been given for
   future research and practices.},

Title = {What Motivates Occasional Faculty Developers to Lead Faculty Development
   Workshops? A Qualitative Study},

Abstract = {Purpose The demand for faculty development is ongoing, and many medical
   schools will need to expand their pool of faculty developers to include
   physicians and scientists whose primary expertise is not education.
   Insight into what motivates occasional faculty developers can guide
   recruitment and retention strategies. This study was designed to
   understand the motivations of faculty developers who occasionally (one
   to three times each year) lead faculty development workshops.
   Method Qualitative data were collected in March and April 2012 from
   interviews with faculty developers who occasionally taught workshops
   from 2007 to 2012 in the University of California, San Francisco, School
   of Medicine's faculty development program. The interviews were
   audiotaped and transcribed. The authors thematically analyzed the
   transcripts using a general inductive approach and developed codes
   sensitized by motivation theories.
   Results The authors interviewed 29/30 (97\%) occasional faculty
   developers and identified five themes: mastery (desire to learn and
   develop professionally), relatedness (enjoyment of working with and
   learning from others), duty (sense of obligation to give back and be a
   good academic citizen), purpose (commitment to improving local teaching
   and ultimately patient care), and satisfaction (fun and enjoyment).
   Conclusions Four of the themes the authors found are well addressed in
   motivation theory literature: mastery, relatedness, duty, and purpose.
   Whereas these four are motivators for occasional faculty developers, it
   is the fifth themesatisfactionthat the authors feel is foundational and
   links the others together. Armed with this understanding, individuals
   leading faculty development programs can develop strategies to recruit
   and retain occasional faculty developers.},

Title = {Communication-Efficient Federated Edge Learning for NR-U-Based IIoT
   Networks},

Abstract = {As a key infrastructural technology, Industrial Internet of Things
   (IIoT) and its related techniques have emerged in the age of Industrial
   Internet. Among them, an increasing popular and attractive federated
   edge learning (FEL) mechanism, which performs data analysis and
   inference at the edge devices distributedly, and aggregates local FEL
   units at a centralized controller, is introduced to meet the stringent
   data privacy and low-latency requirements for high-stake IIoT devices.
   Due to the bandwidth limitation, only parts of the IIoT devices can be
   selected to transmit their local FEL models to the centralized
   controller at each learning step. However, the centralized controller
   prefers to collect all the local FEL models to generate the global FL
   model since each IIoT device has a differential data set. Existing works
   mainly focus on selecting an appropriate subset of IIoT devices through
   advanced scheduling mechanisms without extending the resource bandwidth.
   However, the new radio in unlicensed spectrum (NR-U) technology in the
   5G network opens up new possibilities for FEL since it is a privately
   owned network with fruitful bandwidth resources. We thus propose a novel
   communication-efficient FEL mechanism for NR-U-based IIoT networks,
   which aims to select data importance IIoT devices for local training
   under relatively sufficient unlicensed resources. The objective function
   is formulated as a tradeoff between total FEL data importance and the
   transmission latency via joint learning, device selection, and resource
   management scheduling, which is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming
   (MINLP). To deal with this problem, an alternating direction method of
   multipliers and block coordinate update (ADMM-BCU) algorithm with low
   computational complexity has been used. Closed-form expressions for both
   optimal device selection and resource management are derived, which
   highlighted significant insights. Numerical results demonstrate the
   algorithmic advantages and structural benefits of the proposed
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Efforts to prevent melanoma, especially for those at elevated risk for
   the disease, should ideally begin during childhood. However, there are
   few preventive interventions targeting children who are at higher risk
   for melanoma due to a family history of the disease. Further, there are
   no educational interventions that aim to help these at-risk children
   understand their risk for melanoma and the ways in which preventive
   behaviors, such as sun protection, can mitigate their risk. The current
   paper describes a multidisciplinary team's process for creating a
   developmentally appropriate educational intervention about melanoma risk
   and prevention for children ages 8-17 years who have a family history of
   melanoma. Drawing from the fields of dermatology, health behavior change
   and education, genetic risk communication, science education, and
   graphic arts, the multimedia intervention created covers key learning
   points relevant to understanding melanoma, the role of DNA damage in
   melanoma development, inherited risk factors for melanoma, environmental
   factors causing DNA damage, and methods for preventing DNA damage, such
   as sun protective behaviors. Lessons learned during the development of
   the educational intervention, particularly relevant to multidisciplinary
   team interactions, are discussed. Implications for future testing and
   refinement of the novel educational content are also reviewed.},

Title = {Video-based reflection in teacher education: Comparing virtual reality
   and real classroom videos},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {190},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {While previous studies have examined the use of real-world classroom
   videos to support the development of student teachers' reflective
   skills, there has been little research to date on the use of virtual
   reality (VR) videos in teacher education to provide opportunities for
   authentic reflec-tion. This mixed-methods study investigated changes in
   reflection-related self-efficacy and dif-ferences in written reflection
   processes using a quasi-experimental design with two types of reflection
   stimuli. One group of 46 student teachers used a VR-based video to
   reflect on in-struction while another group of 23 student teachers used
   a real classroom video. We found an increase in reflection-related
   self-efficacy over time among participants in the VR group only. We also
   found that VR videos triggered similar reflection processes to real
   classroom videos. This study shows, for the first time, that video-based
   reflection on VR classroom videos produced comparable results to
   reflection on real classroom videos. This indicates that VR can be used
   successfully in teacher education and that it offers a useful learning
   tool for teacher education programs.},

Title = {A Sequential Implementation Model for Workforce Development: A Case
   Study of Medical Residency Training for Substance Use Concerns},
Journal = {TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {84-94},
Abstract = {Problem: In graduate medical education, residency programs are often
   educationally isolated from each other, with varying needs and patient
   populations, so strategies are needed when attempting to implement
   training in evidence-based practices across multiple residencies.
   Intervention: Using implementation science as a guide, we adapted a
   community development model to sequentially implement an evidence-based
   intervention, Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment
   (SBIRT) for alcohol and drug use problems, across internal medicine,
   pediatrics, emergency medicine, psychiatry, and obstetrics and
   gynecology residency programs. Context: A grant-funded executive team
   coordinated the implementation, enrolled a new residency program
   annually, and served as the consultative team to span the programs. The
   team was attentive to aligning implementation with the needs of each
   program. To assist in planning, the team included a program champion
   1year prior to SBIRT implementation to provide the opportunity to
   develop resources and work with peers. We evaluated this model through
   an implementation science lens using a case study approach that included
   interviews and quantitative tabulation of products and resident
   perceptions. Outcome: We successfully instituted SBIRT training in all 5
   residency programs through the use of a supported local champion model.
   Teams developed 90 curricular products and had 57 presentations and
   publications. Residents reported satisfaction with the SBIRT activities.
   Champions reported that SBIRT was a useful approach and that they gained
   valuable knowledge and relationships from working with the executive
   team when designing learning materials appropriate for their residency.
   Champions successfully incorporated SBIRT into routine clinical
   practice. Lessons Learned: Having a strong team to support subsequent
   SBIRT champions was essential for implementation. The champions needed
   financial support to have the necessary time to implement training. The
   strategy of building a peer network across programs was critical for
   sustaining the implementation. Collecting and sharing resources aided
   the champions in developing their materials.},

Title = {A Passivity-Based Strategy for Manual Corrections in Human-Robot
   Coaching},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In recent years, new programming techniques have been developed in the
   human-robot collaboration (HRC) field. For example, walk-through
   programming allows to program the robot in an easy and intuitive way. In
   this context, a modification of a portion of the trajectory usually
   requires the teaching of the path from the beginning. In this paper we
   propose a passivity-based method to locally change a trajectory based on
   a manual human correction. At the beginning the robot follows the
   nominal trajectory, encoded through the Dynamical Movement Primitives,
   by setting high control gains. When the human grasps the end-effector,
   the robot is made compliant and he/she can drive it along the
   correction. The correction is optimally joined to the nominal
   trajectory, resuming the path tracking. In order to avoid unstable
   behaviors, the variation of the control gains is performed exploiting
   energy tanks, preserving the passivity of the interaction. Finally, the
   correction is spatially fixed so that a variation in the boundary
   conditions (e.g., the initial/final points) does not affect the
   modification.},

Abstract = {PROBLEM: The COVID-19 pandemic has suspended the surgery clinical
   clerkship for third-year medical students at numerous institutions
   across the world. As a result, educators and students have adapted
   rapidly. There is a paucity of precedents regarding urgent and brusque
   formal curricular changes for medical students enrolled in surgical
   clinical rotations.
   APPROACH: The University of California, San Francisco Department of
   Surgery created a surgically focused extended mastery learning rotation
   (EMLR). The surgery clerkship leadership designed a curriculum
   consisting of multiple learning strategies compatible with virtual
   learning environments. The primary aims of the newly developed EMLR were
   to help students consolidate their foundational science knowledge before
   their return to clinical medicine in an altered learning environment.
   The EMLR is currently underway, and further studies are necessary to
   evaluate its effectiveness. ((C) 2020 Association of Program Directors

Abstract = {One of the keys to achieving the United Nation's Sustainable Development
   Goals (SDGs) in education is to introduce novel pedagogical strategies
   into university curricula in order to promote an enhanced acute sense of
   sustainability in future professionals, teachers, and decision-makers.
   This paper aims at analyzing the effectiveness of including green and
   sustainable chemistry on the basis of a systems thinking framework to
   introduce a glocal (global scale, local impact) hot-type topic in an
   experimental chemistry course for first-year undergraduate Chemical
   Engineering students from a public Brazilian university located in Sao
   Paulo state, Brazil. The enormous amount of waste generated locally by
   the citrus processing industry was used as a case study for a
   guided-inquiry laboratory experiment that addressed concepts found in
   interfaces with other systems, such as biorefineries, biocircular
   economies, and green technologies and professional education programs.
   On the basis of student feedback, the alternative procedure proved to be
   technically and pedagogically effective, showing that problem-based
   glocal issues can be useful tools for developing sustainability-minded
   future professionals. Additionally, a set of green and sustainable
   chemistry education (GSCE) principles composing a new metric called the
   Green and Sustainable Chemistry Education Compass Rose was proposed that
   could help educators develop and assess novel experiments to modernize
   and introduce the scientific concepts and tools needed to face the
   world's greatest challenges.},

Title = {How Theory Can Inform Our Understanding of Experiential Learning in
   Quality Improvement Education},

Abstract = {It is widely accepted that quality improvement (QI) education should be
   experiential. Many training programs believe that making QI learning
   hands-on through project-based learning will translate into successful
   learning about QI. However, this pervasive and overly simplistic
   interpretation of experiential QI learning, and the general lack of
   empirical exploration of the factors that influence experiential
   learning processes, may limit the overall impact of project-based
   learning on educational outcomes.
   In this Perspective, the authors explore the opportunities afforded by a
   theoretically informed approach, to deepen understanding of the diverse
   factors that affect experiential QI learning processes in the clinical
   learning environment. The authors introduce the theoretical
   underpinnings of experiential learning more generally, and then draw on
   their experiences and data, obtained in organizing and studying QI
   education activities, to illuminate how sociocultural theories such as
   Billett's workplace learning theory, and sociomaterial perspectives such
   as actor-network theory, can provide valuable lenses for increasing our
   understanding of the varied individuals, objects, contexts, and their
   relationships that influence project-based experiential learning. The
   two theoretically informed approaches that the authors describe are
   amongst numerous others that can inform a QI education research agenda
   aimed at optimizing educational processes and outcomes. The authors
   conclude by highlighting how a theoretically informed QI education
   research agenda can advance the field of QI education; they then
   describe strategies for achieving this goal.},

Title = {Practicing on the Advanced Training in Laparoscopic Suturing Curriculum
   (ATLAS): Is Mastery Learning in Residency Feasible to Achieve
   Expert-Level Performance in Laparoscopic Suturing?},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mastery learning assumes that given enough time and
   appropriate instructional strategies, most trainees will be able to
   achieve proficiency. Expert-level performance requires numerous hours of
   intensive and focus practice. We aimed to study whether it was possible
   for surgical trainees to achieve expert-derived proficiency level in
   laparoscopic suturing using the Advanced Training in Laparoscopic
   Suturing (ATLAS) curriculum over a short period of time.
   STUDY DESIGN: A multicenter IRB approved prospective study included
   surgery residents and minimally invasive fellows. Participants underwent
   weekly supervised instruction and assessments of ATLAS skills and
   self-directed practice between sessions over 12 weeks. Participants were
   asked to practice until they achieved previously established proficiency
   benchmarks of expert laparoscopic surgeons.
   RESULTS: Fifteen participants, PGY2 to PGY6, from 3 institutions
   practiced on the ATLAS curriculum. Three participants were able to
   achieve proficiency on the entire curriculum, with a cumulative practice
   time varying between 3.4 and 7.6 hours. Individual tasks had varying
   degrees of difficulty ranging from 85\% proficiency on task 1 to 33.3\%
   proficiency for task 6. Using a mixed-method model, the mean cumulative
   hours of practice to reach the benchmark threshold was estimated for
   each task and varied from 4.5 to 13.2 hours. The improved performance
   was associated with higher PGY level and proficiency in FLS.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that it is possible for some senior
   surgical trainees to achieve proficiency in an expert-level laparoscopic
   suturing curriculum. This study establishes a learning curve for each
   ATLAS individual task. Some learners may not be able to achieve
   proficiency on the entire curriculum over a short period of practice.
   Additional studies are needed to assess how to shorten the learning
   curve with effective instructional methods such as expert-guided
   training with immediate feedback. (C) 2020 Association of Program

Title = {Institutionalizing evidence-based STEM reform through faculty
   professional development and support structures},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Background Even though student-centered instruction leads to positive
   student outcomes, direct instruction methods are still prevalent.
   Multiple barriers prevent faculty from further adopting evidence-based
   student-centered practices and holistic approaches to faculty support
   are necessary to promote faculty change. The Collaborative for
   Institutionalizing Scientific Learning (CISL) is an HHMI-funded program
   to reform undergraduate science and mathematics education at a large
   Hispanic-Serving public research university. The program has established
   a Faculty Scholar support model to impact the number of science and
   mathematics faculty using evidence-based practices in their classrooms.
   Through this program, Scholars are selected to undertake a
   transformation of a course of their choice and conduct an assessment of
   the impact of the reform on students-while receiving multiple supports
   including summer salary, undergraduate Learning Assistants, professional
   development, course assessment and education research support, and
   opportunities to develop manuscripts on their course transformations.
   Results CISL has supported over 40 Faculty Scholars in the
   transformation of both introductory and upper division biology,
   chemistry, physics and mathematics courses. Faculty are motivated to
   transform a course due to factors related to their own experiences and
   beliefs, their students' needs, the course structure, and/or
   departmental elements. Quantitative analysis of the impact of the
   project on student success show that, overall, students in
   CISL-supported courses have higher passing rates compared to students in
   traditional classrooms. Survey and interviews of Faculty Scholars
   identified that the most valuable elements of the program were the
   personnel support from undergraduate Learning Assistants during reform
   implementation and guidance from the program's Assistant Director during
   design, implementation and evaluation. Conclusions The CISL program
   provides an example of significant effort sustained over several years
   to systematically improve the quality and culture of undergraduate
   education in a large research-intensive Hispanic Serving Institution.
   The program has had an overall positive impact on the professional
   development of Faculty Scholars and led to an increase in the number of
   STEM courses implementing evidence-based teaching practices, thus,
   taking a step towards solidifying a culture of evidence-based
   instructional strategies in STEM departments.},

Title = {``We're all going through it{''}: impact of an online group coaching
   program for medical trainees: a qualitative analysis},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 13},
Abstract = {Background: Trainees in graduate medical education are affected by
   burnout at disproportionate rates. Trainees experience tremendous growth
   in clinical skills and reasoning, however little time is dedicated to
   metacognition to process their experiences or deliberate identity
   formation to create individualized definitions of success and wellbeing.
   The purpose of this study was to understand the perspectives and
   experiences of trainees who participated in a 6-month, web-based, group
   coaching program for women residents in training.
   Methods: Better Together Physician Coaching is a six-month, self-paced,
   online, asynchronous, coaching program with multiple components
   including live coaching calls, unlimited written coaching, and
   self-study modules. Semi-structured interviews of seventeen participants
   of Better Together from twelve GME programs within a single institution
   in Colorado were conducted from May to June of 2021. All identified as
   women and had participated in a 6-month coaching program. Both inductive
   and deductive methods were used in collecting and analyzing the data
   with an aim to understand learners' perceptions of the coaching program,
   including ``how and why{''} the coaching program affected training
   experiences and wellbeing.
   Results: Three main themes emerged as benefits to the coaching program
   from the data: 1) practicing metacognition as a tool for healthy coping
   2) building a sense of community, and 3) the value of a customizable
   experience.
   Conclusions: Female trainees who participated in a group coaching
   program expressed that they found value in learning how to cope with
   stressors through metacognition-focused coaching. They also described
   that building a community and being able to customize the experience
   were positive aspects of the program.},

Title = {The Best Laid Plans? A Qualitative Investigation of How Resident
   Physicians Plan Their Learning},

Abstract = {Purpose Adaptive expertise (AE) has been identified as a critical trait
   to cultivate in future physicians. The 4-phase master adaptive learner
   (MAL) conceptual model describes the learning skills and behaviors
   necessary to develop AE. Though prior work has elucidated skills and
   behaviors used by MALs in the initial planning phase of learning, most
   resident learners are not thought to be MALs. In this study, the authors
   investigated how these majority ``typical{''} learners develop AE by
   exploring the strategies they used in the planning phase of learning.
   Method Participants were resident physicians at graduate medical
   education (GME) training programs located at 4 academic medical centers
   in the United States. Participants participated in semistructured
   individual interviews in 2021, and interview transcripts were analyzed
   using constant comparative analysis of grounded theory. Results Fourteen
   subjects representing 8 specialties were interviewed, generating 152
   pages of transcripts for analysis. Three themes were identified:
   ``Typical{''} learners were challenged by the transition from structured
   undergraduate medical education learning to less-structured GME
   learning, lacked necessary skills to easily navigate this transition,
   and relied on trial and error to develop their learning skills.
   Conclusions Participants used trial and error to find learning
   strategies to help them manage the systemic challenges encountered when
   transitioning from medical school to residency. The success (or failure)
   of these efforts was tied to learners' efficacy with the self-regulated
   learning concepts of agency, metacognitive goal setting, and motivation.
   A conceptual model is provided to describe the impact of these factors
   on residents' ability to be adaptive learners, and actionable
   recommendations are provided to help educators' efforts to foster
   adaptive learning skills and behaviors. These findings also provided
   valuable evidence of validity of the MAL model that has thus far been
   lacking.},

Abstract = {Assessment literacy is increasingly recognized as an important concept
   to consider when developing assessment strategies for courses and
   programs. Assessment literacy approaches support students in their
   understanding of assessment expectations and help them both understand
   and optimize their performance in assessment. In this teaching tip, a
   model for assessment literacy that builds on the well-known Miller's
   Pyramid model for assessment in clinical disciplines is proposed and
   contextualized.The model progresses thinking from assessment methods
   themselves to consideration of the activities that need to be built into
   curricula to ensure that assessment literacy is addressed at each level
   of the pyramid. The teaching tip provides specific examples at each of
   the levels. Finally, the relevance of this work to overall curriculum
   design is emphasized.},

Title = {Adaptation strategies in transnational education: a case study of an
   australian Master of Health Administration Course offered to chinese
   managers},

Abstract = {Background Management decisions in health influence patient care
   outcomes; however, health management development courses in China are
   rare. This study aims to document and evaluate a transnational Master of
   Health Administration (MHA) course launched in 2000 for the benefit of
   Chinese health managers. Methods A case study of the MHA program jointly
   run by an Australian university and a Chinese Medical University was
   conducted. We reviewed the development of the MHA course through a
   document analysis (key events recorded in achieves, minutes, and audits)
   followed by reflection (by two course coordinators), extracting key
   themes related to adaptative strategies. We then conducted a
   questionnaire survey of 139 graduates seeking their views on relevance,
   satisfaction and challenges associated with each subject within the
   course, the relevance of key management skills (as determined by the
   Australasian College of Health Service Management competency framework),
   and the impact of the course on their personal career trajectories.
   Chi-square tests identified differences in the responses by age, gender,
   pre-training position, and current workplace. Results The curriculum
   pedagogy followed the principles of practice-based reflective learning.
   Research findings and student feedback shaped the curriculum design and
   subject content, to enhance management practices of the students. Survey
   participants expressed high levels of satisfaction and confirmed the
   relevance of all study subjects. Two subjects, health economics and data
   management, were perceived as being the most challenging. Of the ten
   management skills we assessed, relatively low self-rated confidence was
   found in ``strategic thinking{''} and ``planning{''}. Younger and less
   experienced graduates were more likely to report learning challenges (p
   < 0.05). Frontline managers were least likely to obtain promotion by
   changing employers (chi(2) = 6.02, p < 0.05) or being seconded to
   another position (chi(2) = 9.41, p < 0.01). Conclusions This case study
   illustrates the suitability of cross-country partnerships in health
   management training, which offers opportunities for managers to
   systematically explore and acquire a comprehensive set of management
   skills applicable to their career needs. Opportunities for developing
   training aligned to career development opportunities are critical for
   attracting and developing a competent and well-prepared health service
   management workforce in China.},

Title = {Effects of high-fidelity simulation on the critical thinking skills of
   baccalaureate nursing students: A causal-comparative research study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {92},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Critical thinking has been identified as one of the
   standards for nursing school accreditation and a long-standing outcome
   of nursing education and nursing practice. High-fidelity simulation is
   one method currently used by nursing programs to increase critical
   thinking in nursing students. Despite these expectations, there is
   limited empirical evidence which compares the effects of simulation to
   other teaching strategies.
   Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine whether
   statistically significant differences existed in mean critical thinking
   skill scores within groups (pretest to posttest) and between groups
   (simulation versus written case studies).
   Design: A quantitative causal-comparative methodology with a
   pretest/posttest design.
   Setting: A private university in the midwestern United States which
   offers a four-year Bachelor of Science Nursing program.
   Participants: Baccalaureate junior nursing students (N = 69) were
   recruited from a convenience sample and divided into two groups which
   consisted of a simulation group (n = 36) and a written case studies
   comparison group (n = 33).
   Methods: This research study consisted of a pretest, three weeks of
   being in either the simulation group or the written case studies group,
   and a posttest. The Health Science Reasoning Test (HSRT) was the
   instrument used for the pretest and posttest to measure critical
   thinking skills of all participants.
   Results: A repeated measures mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA)
   indicated there was no statistically significant difference in
   participants' mean critical thinking scores within groups (pretest to
   posttest) or between groups (simulation versus written case studies).
   Conclusions: The use of high-fidelity simulation as a teaching strategy
   versus written case studies to increase critical thinking skills of
   nursing students was not supported.},

Abstract = {We examine the impact of Biology Mentoring and Engagement (BIOME)
   near-peer mentorship on 437 first-year undergraduate students over three
   cohort years. The BIOME course consists of ten, 50-minute meetings where
   groups of six first-year mentees meet with an upper-division student
   mentor to discuss topics including metacognition, growth mindset, and
   effective study strategies. We employed a mixed-methods approach to
   evaluate the impact of BIOME on mentee academic outcomes. Initial
   ethnographic analysis revealed that BIOME influenced student study
   methods, approaches to academic challenges, and use of campus learning
   communities. We then constructed a novel, program-specific instrument to
   measure the implementation of these habits, a construct we named
   ``academic habit complexity.{''} Regression analysis supported the
   hypothesis that enrollment in BIOME leads to students using more diverse
   approaches than their peers. Enrollment in BIOME, and the associated
   development of academic habit complexity, is related to higher course
   grades in General Chemistry, a biology major prerequisite. Finally,
   students participating in BIOME demonstrated improved short-term student
   retention as measured by increased enrollment in the subsequent
   prerequisite General Chemistry course. These results suggest that
   course-based near-peer mentorship may be an effective and scalable
   approach that can promote student academic success.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To understand how practicing surgeons utilize available
   training methods, which methods are perceived as effective, and
   important barriers to using more effective methods.
   DESIGN: Online survey designed to characterize surgeon utilization and
   perception of available training methods.
   SETTING: Two large Midwestern academic health centers.
   PARTICIPANTS: 150 faculty surgeons.
   METHODS: Nominal values were compared using a McNemar's Test and
   Likert-like values were compared using a paired t-test (IBM SPSS
   Statistics v. 21.0; New York, NY).
   RESULTS: Survey response rate was 81\% (122/150). 98\% of surgeons
   reported learning a new procedure or technology after formal training.
   Many surgeons reported scrubbing in expert cases (78\%) and
   self-directed study (66\%), while few surgeons(6\%) completed a
   mini-fellowship. The modalities used most commonly were scrubbing in
   expert cases (34\%) and self-directed study (27\%). Few surgeons (7\%)
   believed self-directed study would be most effective, whereas 31\% and
   16\% believed operating under supervision and mini-fellowships would be
   most effective, respectively. Surgeons believed more effective methods
   ``would require too much time{''} or they had ``confidence in their
   ability to implement safely.{''}
   CONCLUSIONS: Practicing surgeons use a variety of training methods when
   learning new procedures and technologies, and there is disconnect
   between commonly used training methods and those deemed most effective.
   Confidence in surgeon's ability was cited as a reason for this
   discrepancy; and surgeons found time associated with more effective
   methods to be prohibitive. (C) 2017 Association of Program Directors in

Title = {Early Clinical Experiences for Second-Year Student Pharmacists at an
   Academic Medical Center},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {79},
Number = {9},
Abstract = {Objective. To examine student outcomes associated with the Student
   Medication and Reconciliation Team (SMART) program, which was designed
   to provide second-year student pharmacists at the University of North
   Carolina (UNC) Eshelman School of Pharmacy direct patient care
   experience at UNC Medical Center.
   Design. Twenty-two second-year student pharmacists were randomly
   selected from volunteers, given program training, and scheduled for
   three 5-hour evening shifts in 2013-2014. Pre/post surveys and
   reflection statements were collected from 19 students. Data were
   analyzed with a mixed methods approach.
   Assessment. Survey results revealed an increase in student self-efficacy
   (p<0.05) and positive perceptions of SMART. Qualitative findings suggest
   the program provided opportunities for students to develop strategies
   for practice, promoted an appreciation for the various roles pharmacists
   play in health care, and fostered an appreciation for the complexity of
   real-world practice.
   Conclusion. Early clinical experiences can enhance student learning and
   development while fostering an appreciation for pharmacy practice.},

Title = {A cooperative water wave optimization algorithm with reinforcement
   learning for the distributed assembly no-idle flowshop scheduling
   problem},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {153},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The distributed assembly no-idle flow-shop scheduling problem (DANIFSP)
   is a novel and considerable model, which is suitable for the modern
   supply chains and manufacturing systems. In this study, a cooperative
   water wave optimization algorithm, named CWWO, is proposed to address
   the DANIFSP with the goal of minimizing the maximum assembly completion
   time. In the propagation phase, a reinforcement learning mechanism based
   on the framework of the VNS is designed to balance the exploration and
   exploitation of the CWWO algorithm. Afterwards, the path-relinking
   combined with the VNS method as the modified breaking operator is
   introduced to enhance the capability of local search. Furthermore, a
   multi-neighborhood perturbation strategy in the refraction phase is
   applied to extract knowledge information to increase the probability of
   escaping the local optimal. Moreover, the comprehensive experimental
   program is executed to calibrate the control parameters of the CWWO
   algorithm and illustrate the cooperative effect of the three modified
   operations. The performance of the CWWO algorithm is verified on the
   benchmark set, and the experimental results demonstrated the stability
   and validity of the CWWO algorithm.},

Title = {Health professionals and students' experiences of reflective writing in
   learning: A qualitative meta-synthesis},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},

Month = {JUL 22},
Abstract = {Background Reflective writing provides an opportunity for health
   professionals and students to learn from their mistakes, successes,
   anxieties, and worries that otherwise would remain disjointed and
   worthless. This systematic review addresses the following question:
   ``What are the experiences of health professionals and students in
   applying reflective writing during their education and training?{''}
   Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-synthesis of
   qualitative studies. Our search comprised six electronic databases:
   MedLine, Embase, Cinahl, PsycINFO, Eric, and Scopus. Our initial search
   produced 1237 titles, excluding duplicates that we removed. After title
   and abstract screening, 17 articles met the inclusion criteria. We
   identified descriptive themes and the conceptual elements explaining the
   health professionals' and students' experience using reflective writing
   during their academic and in-service training by performing a
   meta-synthesis. Results We identified four main categories (and related
   sub-categories) through the meta-synthesis: reflection and reflexivity,
   accomplishing learning potential, building a philosophical and empathic
   approach, and identifying reflective writing feasibility. We placed the
   main categories into an interpretative model which explains the users'
   experiences of reflective writing during their education and training.
   Reflective writing triggered reflection and reflexivity that allows, on
   the one hand, skills development, professional growth, and the ability
   to act on change; on the other hand, the acquisition of empathic
   attitudes and sensitivity towards one's own and others' emotions.
   Perceived barriers and impeding factors and facilitating ones, like
   timing and strategies for using reflective writing, were also
   identified. Conclusions The use of this learning methodology is crucial
   today because of the recognition of the increasing complexity of
   healthcare contexts requiring professionals to learn advanced skills
   beyond their clinical ones. Implementing reflective writing-based
   courses and training in university curricula and clinical contexts can
   benefit human and professional development.},

Title = {BFEDroid: A Feature Selection Technique to Detect Malware in Android
   Apps Using Machine Learning},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {Malware detection refers to the process of detecting the presence of
   malware on a host system, or that of determining whether a specific
   program is malicious or benign. Machine learning-based solutions first
   gather information from applications and then use machine learning
   algorithms to develop a classifier that can distinguish between
   malicious and benign applications. Researchers and practitioners have
   long paid close attention to the issue. Most previous work has addressed
   the differences in feature importance or the computation of feature
   weights, which is unrelated to the classification model used, and
   therefore, the implementation of a selection approach with limited
   feature hiccups, and increases the execution time and memory usage.
   BFEDroid is a machine learning detection strategy that combines
   backward, forward, and exhaustive subset selection. This proposed
   malware detection technique can be updated by retraining new
   applications with true labels. It has higher accuracy (99\%), lower
   memory consumption (1680), and a shorter execution time (1.264SI) than
   current malware detection methods that use feature selection.},

Title = {Medical student wellbeing - a consensus statement from Australia and New
   Zealand},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {BackgroundMedical student wellbeing-a consensus statement from Australia
   and New Zealand outlines recommendations for optimising medical student
   wellbeing within medical schools in our region. Worldwide, medical
   schools have responsibilities to respond to concerns about student
   psychological, social and physical wellbeing, but guidance for medical
   schools is limited. To address this gap, this statement clarifies key
   concepts and issues related to wellbeing and provides recommendations
   for educational program design to promote both learning and student
   wellbeing. The recommendations focus on student selection; learning,
   teaching and assessment; learning environment; and staff development.
   Examples of educational initiatives from the evidence-base are provided,
   emphasising proactive and preventive approaches to student
   wellbeing.Main recommendationsThe consensus statement provides specific
   recommendations for medical schools to consider at all stages of program
   design and implementation. These are:Design curricula that promote peer
   support and progressive levels of challenge to students.Employ
   strategies to promote positive outcomes from stress and to help others
   in need.Design assessment tasks to foster wellbeing as well as
   learning.Provide mental health promotion and suicide prevention
   initiatives.Provide physical health promotion initiatives.Ensure safe
   and health-promoting cultures for learning in on-campus and clinical
   settings.Train staff on student wellbeing and how to manage wellbeing
   concerns.ConclusionA broad integrated approach to improving student
   wellbeing within medical school programs is recommended. Medical schools
   should work cooperatively with student and trainee groups, and partner
   with clinical services and other training bodies to foster safe
   practices and cultures. Initiatives should aim to assist students to
   develop adaptive responses to stressful situations so that graduates are
   prepared for the realities of the workplace. Multi-institutional,
   longitudinal collaborative research in Australia and New Zealand is
   needed to close critical gaps in the evidence needed by medical schools
   in our region.},

Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},

Abstract = {Background: The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Accreditation Council
   mandates the teaching of cultural safety in Bachelor of Nursing and
   Midwifery programs in Australia. However nursing and midwifery academics
   may lack the awareness and knowledge required to share and develop
   cultural safety practices with their students. Specific cultural safety
   professional development for academics may be needed.Objectives: This
   research explores how nursing and midwifery academics at an Australian
   university understand cultural safety and whether they are equipped to
   embed it in the curriculum. It also examines whether professional
   development workshops can support academics to prepare for cultural
   safety.Methods: An intervention involving three cultural safety
   professional development workshops was offered to nursing academics at
   an Australian university. The authors used qualitative surveys to
   consider whether the workshops deepened participants' understanding of
   cultural safety and developed the self-reflection required to embed
   cultural safety in teaching.Results: The workshops contributed to
   participants' improved understandings of culture, colonisation, white
   privilege and the need for self-reflection, but not all participants
   developed a working knowledge of cultural safety practice.Conclusion:
   Professional development workshops can assist nursing and midwifery
   academics to develop their knowledge of cultural safety, but detailed,
   contextual understanding is likely to need more than three sessions.
   Academics' motivations to include cultural safety in their teaching may
   be linked to their desire for patientdriven and equitable services and a
   desire to meet accreditation requirements.},

Abstract = {Two XML query languages were tested for intuitivity, learnability and
   memorability. The languages differ with relation to the query structures
   like the use of variables, iterators and reference to attributes. One of
   the languages, XQuery, is a procedural, expressive and data-oriented
   query language that is suitable even for programming purposes; the
   other, XIL, is more declarative, document-oriented query language with a
   simpler syntax. A query-writing test with the learners of the languages
   was executed. The study indicates that, in the query writing, the more
   procedural query language yields a greater number of correct queries.
   Similarity between the tested languages, and to SQL, is discussed from
   the point of view of learnability.},

Title = {Discordance Between Resident and Faculty Perceptions of Resident
   Autonomy: Can Self-Determination Theory Help Interpret Differences and
   Guide Strategies for Bridging the Divide?},

Abstract = {Purpose
   To identify and interpret differences between resident and faculty
   perceptions of resident autonomy and of faculty support of resident
   autonomy.
   Method
   Parallel questionnaires were sent to pediatric residents and faculty at
   the University of Rochester Medical Center in 2011. Items addressed
   self-determination theory (SDT) constructs (autonomy, competence,
   relatedness) and asked residents and faculty to rate and/or comment on
   their own and the other group's behaviors. Distributions of responses to
   17 parallel Likert scale items were compared by Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.
   Written comments underwent qualitative content analysis.
   Results
   Respondents included 62/78 residents (79\%) and 71/100 faculty (71\%).
   The groups differed significantly on 15 of 17 parallel items but agreed
   that faculty sometimes provided too much direction. Written comments
   suggested that SDT constructs were closely interrelated in residency
   training. Residents expressed frustration that their care plans were
   changed without explanation. Faculty reported reluctance to give
   ``passive{''} residents autonomy in patient care unless stakes were low.
   Many reported granting more independence to residents who displayed
   motivation and competence. Some described working to overcome residents'
   passivity by clarifying and reinforcing expectations.
   Conclusions
   Faculty and residents had discordant perceptions of resident autonomy
   and of faculty support for resident autonomy. When faculty restrict the
   independence of ``passive{''} residents whose competence they question,
   residents may receive fewer opportunities for active learning.
   Strategies that support autonomy, such as scaffolding, may help
   residents gain confidence and competence, enhance residents' relatedness
   to team members and supervisors, and help programs adapt to
   accreditation requirements to foster residents' growth in independence.},

Abstract = {The development of a remote, synchronous general chemistry lab course,
   which was offered to 800 students in the fall semester of 2020, is
   described. The course was designed with similar curricular goals as our
   in-person lab course and featured chemistry kits developed by a team of
   faculty, staff, and graduate TAs. The kits, which were distributed via a
   rental program through the university bookstore, provided students the
   opportunity to conduct hands-on experiments at home or in their dorm
   room. To create the remote lab course, the team negotiated logistical
   and curricular issues such as finding alternatives to costly precision
   glassware and instrumentation, adding strategies for engaging students
   online, decreasing chemical hazards of experiments, and encouraging a
   safety culture for students working remotely. A professional development
   graduate course for TA instructors, associated with the general
   chemistry lab program, was also enhanced by including topics that were
   relevant for understanding remote learning environments. In redesigning
   the lab course for remote delivery, we developed new experiments (e.g.,
   calibration), introduced new engagement strategies (e.g., badging),
   revised several experiments (e.g., heats of reaction), included an
   Arduino-based spectrometer (e.g., visible spectroscopy and pulse
   oximetry), and provided new student supports (e.g., TAs on-call). Survey
   data was gathered to assess student evaluation of the hands-on
   activities, the presence of synchronous TA help, the badging experience,
   the value of the lab course, and challenges faced in taking the lab
   course during a pandemic.},

   professionals' education can play an important role in ensuring that new
   generations of workers have sound personal and professional competencies
   to successfully face the challenges of professional practice. These
   challenges are described in the literature, but the extent to which they
   are considered in health professionals' education is less clear. Methods
   This qualitative study compares the professional challenges and
   educational needs described in the literature with the current curricula
   for health professionals offered in Switzerland. Data were collected
   nationally through focus group interviews with 65\% of Switzerland's
   directors of bachelor's and master's programs of health professions
   (nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, midwifery, nutrition and
   dietetics, osteopathy, radiologic medical imaging technology, health
   promotion and prevention, and health sciences). The data attained were
   analyzed using knowledge mapping. Results The results reveal a gap among
   education programs with regard to occupational health promotion and
   cultural diversity. Both topics are taught with a sole focus on
   patients, and students are expected to adopt similar strategies for
   their health promotion and stress management. Physicians are
   insufficiently involved in interprofessional education. The programs
   fail to enhance health professionals' political, economic and digital
   competencies. Conclusion The results of this study offer clear guidance
   about what topics need to be integrated into curricula to improve health
   professionals' well-being at work and their preparedness to face daily
   professional challenges.},

   An examination of attitudes, motivations, and barriers},

Abstract = {During the widespread development of open access online course materials
   in the last two decades, advances have been made in understanding the
   impact of instructional design on quantitative outcomes. Much less is
   known about the experiences of learners that affect their engagement
   with the course content. Through a case study employing text analysis of
   interview transcripts, we revealed the authentic voices of participants
   and gained a deeper understanding of motivations for and barriers to
   course engagements experienced by students participating in Massive Open
   Online Courses (MOOCs). We sought to understand why learners take the
   courses, specifically Introduction to Chemistry or Data Analysis and
   Statistical Inference, and to identify factors both inside and outside
   of the course setting that impacted engagement and learning. Thirty-six
   participants in the courses were interviewed, and these students varied
   in age, experience with the subject matter, and worldwide geographical
   location. Most of the interviewee statements were neutral in attitude;
   sentiment analysis of the interview transcripts revealed that 80 percent
   of the statements that were either extremely positive or negative were
   found to be positive rather than negative, and this is important because
   an overall positive climate is known to correlate with higher academic
   achievement in traditional education settings. When demographic data was
   added to the sentiment analysis, students who have already earned
   bachelor's degrees were found to be more positive about the courses than
   students with either more or less formal education, and this was a
   highly statistically significant result. In general, students from
   America were more critical than students from Africa and Asia, and the
   sentiments of female participants' comments were generally less positive
   than those of male participants. An examination of student statements
   related to motivations revealed that knowledge, work, convenience, and
   personal interest were the most frequently coded nodes (more generally
   referred to as ``codes{''}). On the other hand, lack of time was the
   most prevalently coded barrier for students. Other barriers and
   challenges cited by the interviewed learners included previous bad
   classroom experiences with the subject matter, inadequate background,
   and lack of resources such as money, infrastructure, and internet
   access. These results are enriched by illustrative quotes from interview
   transcripts and compared and contrasted with previous findings reported
   in the literature, and thus this study enhances the field by providing
   the voices of the learners. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Objective. To explore methods used by pharmacy programs to attract and
   sustain relationships with preceptors and experiential practice sites.
   Methods. Interviews with eight focus groups of pharmacy experiential
   education experts (n=35) were conducted at two national pharmacy
   meetings. A semi-structured interview guide was used. Focus group
   interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and categorically coded
   independently by two researchers. Codes were compared, consensus was
   reached through discussion, and two experiential education experts
   assisted with interpretation of the coded data.
   Results. Six themes emerged consistently across focus groups: a
   perceived increase in preceptor compensation, intended vs actual use of
   payments by sites, concern over renegotiation of established
   compensation, costs and benefits of experiential students,
   territorialism, and motives.
   Conclusion. Fostering a culture of collaboration may counteract
   potentially competitive strategies to gain sites. Participants shared a
   common interest in providing high-quality experiential learning where
   sites and preceptors participated for altruistic reasons, rather than
   compensation.},

Title = {Challenges in PhD education due to COVID-19-disrupted supervision or
   business as usual: a cross-sectional survey of Swedish biomedical
   sciences graduate students},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 22},
Abstract = {Background It remains unclear to what extent the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19
   pandemic disrupted the normal progression of biomedical and medical
   science graduate programs and if there was a lasting impact on the
   quality and quantity of supervision of PhD-students. To date, multiple
   editorials and commentaries indicate the severity of the disruption
   without providing sufficient evidence with quantifiable data. Methods An
   online survey was submitted to the administrative offices of biomedical
   and medical PhD-programs at eight major universities in Sweden to gauge
   the impact of the pandemic on the students. It consisted of
   multiple-choice and open-ended questions where students could provide
   examples of positive and/or negative supervision strategies. Open
   answered questions were coded as either examples of positive or negative
   support. Results PhD students were divided into two groups: those with
   improved or unchanged supervision during the pandemic (group 1, n =
   185), versus those whose supervision worsened (group 2, n = 69). Group 1
   received more help from supervisors and more frequent supervision via
   both online and alternative platforms (email/messages and telephone).
   There was no significant difference in educational-stage, gender or
   caretaking responsibilities between the groups. Conclusions It is
   important for the scientific community to learn how to provide the best
   possible supervision for PhD students during the pandemic. Our data
   suggests that more frequent supervision, and using a diverse array of
   meeting platforms is helpful. In addition, it is important for the
   students to feel that they have their supervisor's emotional support.
   Several students also expressed that they would benefit from an
   extension of their PhD programs due to delays caused by the pandemic.},

Title = {Perfecting practice: a protocol for assessing simulation-based mastery
   learning and deliberate practice versus self-guided practice for
   bougie-assisted cricothyroidotomy performance},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {APR 5},
Abstract = {Background: Simulation-based medical education (SBME) is a cornerstone
   for procedural skill training in residency education. Multiple studies
   have concluded that SBME is highly effective, superior to traditional
   clinical education, and translates to improved patient outcomes.
   Additionally it is widely accepted that mastery learning, which
   comprises deliberate practice, is essential for expert level performance
   for routine skills; however, given that highly structured practice is
   more time and resource-intensive, it is important to assess its value
   for the acquisition of rarely performed technical skills. The
   bougie-assisted cricothyroidotomy (BAC), a rarely performed, lifesaving
   procedure, is an ideal skill for evaluating the utility of highly
   structured practice as it is relevant across many acute care specialties
   and rare - making it unlikely for learners to have had significant
   previous training or clinical experience. The purpose of this study is
   to compare a modified mastery learning approach with deliberate practice
   versus self-guided practice on technical skill performance using a
   bougie-assisted cricothyroidotomy model.
   Methods: A multi-centre, randomized study will be conducted at four
   Canadian and one American residency programs with 160 residents assigned
   to either mastery learning and deliberate practice (ML + DP), or
   self-guided practice for BAC. Skill performance, using a global rating
   scale, will be assessed before, immediately after practice, and 6 months
   later. The two groups will be compared to assess whether the type of
   practice impacts performance and skill retention.
   Discussion: Mastery learning coupled with deliberate practice provides
   systematic and focused feedback during skill acquisition. However, it is
   resource-intensive and its efficacy is not fully defined. This
   multi-centre study will provide generalizable data about the utility of
   highly structured practice for technical skill acquisition of a rare,
   lifesaving procedure within postgraduate medical education. Study
   findings will guide educators in the selection of an optimal training
   strategy, addressing both short and long term performance.},

Title = {Nursing students' perceived stress, coping strategies, health and
   supervisory approaches in clinical practice: A Slovak and Czech
   perspective},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {65},
Pages = {4-10},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objectives: To investigate the relationship between supervisory
   approaches in clinical practice on the one hand, and nursing students'
   level of experience, perceived stress, coping strategies and
   physio-psychosocial status on the other.
   Design: A cross-sectional descriptive study.
   Methods: The sample consisted of 275 nursing students enrolled in
   bachelor's degree programs in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
   Participants provided data on background characteristics as well as
   completing the following instruments: Perceived Stress Scale;
   Physio-Psycho-Social Response Scale, and Coping Behavior Inventory.
   Relationships were examined by parametric Pearson correlations and
   multiple regression analyses. For group comparisons, multi-factor
   analysis of variance procedure was performed.
   Results: Experienced nursing students perceived higher levels of stress
   than novice students. Slovak students subject to traditional group
   supervision by nursing teachers reported higher stress levels related to
   teachers, peers, lack of professional knowledge and skills, while also
   reporting a higher frequency of avoidance behaviors; and less frequent
   problem-solving activity than Czech students under individual
   supervision by clinical mentors. Clinical stressors accounted for 22\%
   of variance in the students' physical, psychological and social health.
   Academic stressors accounted for only 5\% of variance and avoidance
   behaviors only 2\% of variance in student's physical, psychological and
   social health.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that the stress or anxiety perceived
   by nursing students is acounted for mainly by clinical stressors.
   Further studies should focus on identifying other predictors (personal,
   external) of students' physical, psychological and social health and
   also examine the effectiveness of specific stress management programs
   and, individual supervisory approaches in reducing the intensity and,
   the negative effects of stressors.},

Abstract = {In this paper, an online energy management strategy (EMS) for hybrid
   electric tracked vehicle (HETV) is developed based on deep deterministic
   policy gradient (DDPG) with time-varying weighting factor to further
   improve economic performance of HETV and reduce computational burden.
   The DDPG is applied to model the EMS problem for the target HETV.
   Especially, a time-varying weighting factor is introduced here to update
   old network parameters with experience learned from most recent cycle
   segment. Afterwards, simulation is conducted to verify the effectiveness
   and adaptability of the proposed method. Results show that DDPG-based
   EMS with online updating mechanism can achieve nearly 90\% fuel economy
   performance as that of dynamic programming while computational time is
   greatly reduced. Finally, hardware-in-loop experiment is carried out to
   evaluate the real-world performance of the proposed method.},

Title = {Strengthening Teachers' Professional Identities Through Faculty
   Development},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {94},
Number = {7},
Pages = {963-968},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Although medical schools espouse a commitment to the educational
   mission, faculty members often struggle to develop and maintain their
   identities as teachers. Teacher identity is important because it can
   exert a powerful influence on career choice, academic roles and
   responsibilities, and professional development opportunities. However,
   most faculty development initiatives focus on knowledge and skill
   acquisition rather than the awakening or strengthening of professional
   identity. The goal of this Perspective is to highlight the importance of
   faculty members' professional identities as teachers, explore how
   faculty development programs and activities can support teachers'
   identities, and describe specific strategies that can be used in
   professional development. These strategies include the embedding of
   identity and identity formation into existing offerings by asking
   questions related to identity, incorporating identity in longitudinal
   programs, building opportunities for community building and networking,
   promoting reflection, and capitalizing on mentorship. Stand-alone
   faculty development activities focusing on teachers' identities can also
   be helpful, as can a variety of approaches that advocate for
   organizational change and institutional support. To achieve excellence
   in teaching and learning, faculty members need to embrace their
   identities as teachers and be supported in doing so by their
   institutions and by faculty development.},

Abstract = {The time students spend in a learning management system (LMS) is an
   important measurement in learning analytics (LA). One of the most common
   data sources is log files from LMS, which do not directly reveal the
   online time, the duration of which needs to be estimated. As this
   measurement has a great impact on the results of statistical models in
   LA, its estimation is crucial. In the literature, there are many
   strategies for estimating the duration, which do not represent the
   actual online time of the students. In this article, we combine LMS log
   files of our students with parallel screen recordings and automatically
   analyze for how long the LMS is present in the video. We visualize the
   results and show that common online time estimation strategies do not
   represent the online time for our students accurately. By using modified
   online time estimation methods, we find estimations that fit the data of
   our students better on an individual basis.},

Title = {Development of numerical model-based machine learning algorithms for
   different healing stages of distal radius fracture healing},
Journal = {COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {233},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background and objectives: Early therapeutic exercises are vital for the
   healing of distal radius fractures (DRFs) treated with the volar locking
   plate. However, current development of rehabilitation plans us-ing
   computational simulation is normally time-consuming and requires high
   computational power. Thus, there is a clear need for developing machine
   learning (ML) based algorithms that are easy for end-users to implement
   in daily clinical practice. The purpose of the present study is to
   develop optimal ML algo-rithms for designing effective DRF physiotherapy
   programs at different stages of healing.Method: First, a
   three-dimensional computational model for the healing of DRF was
   developed by inte-grating mechano-regulated cell differentiation, tissue
   formation and angiogenesis. The model is capable of predicting
   time-dependant healing outcomes based on different physiologically
   relevant loading condi-tions, fracture geometries, gap sizes, and
   healing time. After being validated using available clinical data, the
   developed computational model was implemented to generate a total of
   3600 clinical data for train-ing the ML models. Finally, the optimal ML
   algorithm for each healing stage was identified.Results: The selection
   of the optimal ML algorithm depends on the healing stage. The results
   from this study show that cubic support vector machine (SVM) has the
   best performance in predicting the healing outcomes at the early stage
   of healing, while trilayered ANN outperforms other ML algorithms in the
   late stage of healing. The outcomes from the developed optimal ML
   algorithms indicate that Smith fractures with medium gap sizes could
   enhance the healing of DRF by inducing larger cartilaginous callus,
   while Colles fractures with large gap sizes may lead to delayed healing
   by bringing excessive fibrous tissues.Conclusions: ML represents a
   promising approach for developing efficient and effective
   patient-specific rehabilitation strategies. However, ML algorithms at
   different healing stages need to be carefully chosen before being
   implemented in clinical applications. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Development of a neonatal curriculum for medical students in Zimbabwe -
   a cross sectional survey},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {MAY 2},
Abstract = {Background: Calls have been made to reassess the curricula of medical
   schools throughout the world to adopt competence-based programs that
   address the healthcare needs of society. Zimbabwe is a country
   characterized by a high neonatal mortality rate of 24 per 1000 live
   births. The current research sought to determine the content and
   appropriate teaching strategies needed to guide the development of an
   undergraduate neonatal curriculum map for medical students at the
   University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences.
   Methods: We surveyed faculty (n = 8) and non-faculty pediatricians (n =
   5), senior resident medical officers (N = 26) using a self-administered
   questionnaire, and completed one focus group discussion with midwives (n
   = 11). We asked respondents their expectations regarding knowledge,
   psychomotor skills, competencies, and teaching strategies in a basic
   newborn curriculum for medical students. Relevant policy and curricula
   documents were reviewed to assess newborn health needs and the current
   training. A group of faculty educationists (n = 11) collated and
   finalized the findings from the document review, survey, and focus group
   using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis.
   Results: The document review revealed three key neonatal health
   objectives according to the current national maternal and neonatal
   health road map. These objectives are to be met using a four tier
   approach comprising (i) family planning (ii) focused antenatal care
   (iii) clean and safe delivery and (iv) basic and comprehensive emergency
   obstetric \& neonatal care. Existing curriculum has 15 newborn topics
   taught in lecture style during the pediatric rotations, and five newborn
   care skills to be learned through observation. The existing curriculum
   is silent on desired competencies. In the current study 19 cognitive
   areas, 17 psychomotor skills and six competency domains were identified
   for an ideal neonatal curriculum for undergraduate students. A
   combination of teaching strategies including classroom, simulation and a
   clinical rotation were recommended.
   Conclusion: This study revealed a significant gap between the existing
   neonatal curriculum and the ideal curriculum as recommended by broad
   stakeholders in the context of national health care needs. Next steps
   are to complete the development and implementation of the proposed
   curriculum map to better align with the ideal state.},

Title = {A report on the blended short-term supplementary course on
   ``Developmental Care for infants and toddlers{''} taught with a
   multidisciplinary approach for pediatricians -qualitative and
   quantitative study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Background: The implementation of follow-up programs for high-risk
   infants and toddlers aimed to promptly diagnose developmental delays and
   disorders and initiate early intervention to help improve their
   developmental status, reduce their care costs in the future, as well as
   improve their productivity as members of society. There is a lack of
   qualified specialists in the infant and toddler development field in
   Iran. To compensate for the lack of training in this area, for the first
   time, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences has designed a short-term
   supplementary course of ``Developmental Care for Infants and Toddlers
   ``. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the field of child
   development, this course has been designed as such. The current study
   aimed to evaluate this course and explain the graduates' relevant
   experiences using a multidisciplinary approach.Methods: The current
   study is a quantitative/qualitative study conducted in two phases. In
   the first step, the learners were asked to assess the teaching quality
   of the short-term supplementary course of ``Developmental Care for
   Infants and Toddlers `` in 5 areas of ``educational design, `` ``course
   administrators' support ``, `` learners' motivation ``, ``acquisition of
   general learning and specialized skills `` using the Australian Course
   Experience Questionnaire (CEQ). All graduates completed the
   questionnaires. The data from the questionnaires were analyzed using
   descriptive statistics of medians, and interquartile ranges in SPSS
   software. The second step was a qualitative study to explain the
   graduates' experiences of this course with a multidisciplinary approach.
   The samples were selected using a purposive sampling technique. The
   samples were those who had completed the course mentioned above, had
   rich experiences in this field, and were willing to share them. The data
   were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed using
   conventional content analysis.Results: In general, the graduates'
   satisfaction with the course in terms of the five areas studied was
   evaluated as follows: Educational design, motivating participants to do
   their best had the greatest median. 5(4-5), Learning objectives; in all
   items, the median was 4. Course content and resources; all items median
   were 4 .Relevant learner assessment methods; in all items, the median
   was 4.The median learners' satisfaction in the areas of ``course
   administrators' support `` in all items was 4 and ``learners' motivation
   ``, was 5. Learner's motivation `` in all items it was 4, indicating the
   highest level of satisfaction with the ``acquisition of specialized
   skills ``. In the area of education design, the highest satisfaction was
   found with the appropriateness of teaching strategies. The codes
   extracted from the analysis of interviews with the graduates, are
   divided into four categories: ``Ethical and professional commitment of
   course teachers ``, ``Being a role model in the observance of patients
   and their caregivers' rights ``, ``Course planning with a
   multidisciplinary approach and teamwork `` as well as ``The use of
   virtual platforms to strengthen and maintain team communication between
   learners ``.Conclusion: This course was the first experience of applying
   a multidisciplinary approach in an interprofessional course.Ideally, it
   is indispensable for the Iranian medical education system to move away
   from specialization and connect all related specialties and disciplines
   to achieve its educational and therapeutic goals.
   Therefore, the design of this course can be applied as an educational
   model for other disciplines and clinical courses.},

Title = {Using Team Census Caps to Optimize Education, Patient Care, and
   Wellness: A Survey of Internal Medicine Residency Program Directors},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {95},
Number = {4},
Pages = {567-573},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Purpose
   To discover whether internal medicine (IM) residency program directors
   use lower-than-required caps on general medicine wards, critical care
   units, and inpatient subspecialty wards; describe justifications for
   lower-than-required general medicine ward caps and strategies for when
   caps have been exceeded or the number of patients is a detriment to
   critical thinking or education; and assess whether caps were associated
   with program characteristics.
   Method
   From August to December 2016, the Association of Program Directors in
   Internal Medicine surveyed all member program directors about team caps
   and their effects on the learning environment. Responses were appended
   with publicly available or licensed third-party data. Programs were
   categorized by type, size, and region.
   Results
   Overall response rate was 65.7\% (251/382 programs). Nearly all
   (244/248; 98.4\%) reported caps for general medicine ward teams (mean =
   17.0 {[}standard deviation (SD) = 4.2]). Fewer (171/247; 69.2\%) had
   caps for critical care teams (mean = 13.8 {[}SD = 5.4]). Fewer still
   (131/225; 58.2\%) had caps for inpatient subspecialty ward teams (mean =
   14.8 {[}SD = 6.0]). Fewer first-quartile programs (0-28 residents)
   reported having caps on inpatient subspecialty teams (P < .001).
   Directors reported higher caps compromised education (109/130; 83.8\%),
   patient care (89/130; 68.5\%), and/or resident wellness (77/130;
   59.2\%). Nonteaching services (181/249; 72.7\%), patient transfers
   (110/249; 44.2\%), or ``backup{''} residents (67/249; 26.9\%) were used
   when caps are reached or the number of patients is detrimental to
   critical thinking or education.
   Conclusions
   IM program directors frequently exercise discretion when setting caps.
   Accrediting bodies should explicitly encourage such adjustments and
   allow differentiation by setting.},

Title = {Adapting to the Times: Combining Microlearning Videos and Twitter to
   Teach Surgical Technique},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {79},

Pages = {850-854},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Surgical videos are commonly utilized by trainees to prepare
   for surgical cases. However, currently available videos tend to be of
   excessive length, variable quality, and exist behind paywalls or in
   other exclusive formats. Our objective was to create a series of videos
   that would address these shortcomings, and further allow for dynamic
   engagement between learners and experts. DESIGN: Our group created
   surgical videos using principles of microlearning, an educational
   strategy which deconstructs content into small units and uses social
   media platforms where learners and educators may actively engage. We
   published a library of short (< 3 min) videos covering various steps of
   abdominal transplantation operations on a YouTube channel. We leveraged
   Twitter to disseminate the content and engage with experts and learners
   from around the world. SETTING: Multi-institutional. RESULTS: Over the
   period from July 2020 to January 2021, 24 microlearning videos were
   created, stored on a YouTube channel, and posted to Twitter weekly using
   a newly created account. During that time period, the videos, averaging
   124 seconds in length, were viewed 4393 times and watched for a total of
   127 hours. The account gained 611 followers in 37 countries and 37 US
   states with 312,400 impressions (defined as tweet views). Twitter users
   who engaged with our microlearning content (favorite, retweet, or reply)
   included faculty (27\%), residents (21\%), fellows (8\%), and medical
   students (11\%). CONCLUSIONS: Broad participation with the educational
   material and discussion on Twitter demonstrated the potential for the
   microlearning technique to provide educational benefit for learners
   internationally. The spread of the tweets shows an opportunity to
   augment traditional surgical education, and the willingness of faculty
   to discuss alternative techniques with their peers. Our group will
   continue to develop a library of microlearning videos for surgical
   operations and engage with other institutions for collaboration and
   expansion. (C) 2022 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

Title = {Effect of Process Changes in Surgical Training on Quantitative Outcomes
   From Surgery Residency Programs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {73},
Number = {5},
Pages = {807-818},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to review the literature on
   process changes in surgical training programs and to evaluate their
   effect on the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education
   (ACGME) Core Competencies, American Board of Surgery In-Training
   Examination (ABSITE) scores, and American Board of Surgery (ABS)
   certification.
   DESIGN: A literature search was obtained from MEDLINE via PubMed.gov,
   ScienceDirect.com, Google Scholar on all peer-reviewed studies published
   since 2003 using the following search queries: surgery residency
   training, surgical education, competency-based surgical education, ACGME
   core competencies, ABSITE scores, and ABS pass rate.
   RESULTS: Our initial search list included 990 articles on surgery
   residency training models, 539 on competency-based surgical education,
   78 on ABSITE scores, and 33 on ABS pass rate. Overall, 31 articles met
   inclusion criteria based on their effect on ACGME Core Competencies,
   ABSITE scores, and ABS certification. Systematic review showed that
   5/31, 19/31, and 6/31 articles on process changes in surgical training
   programs had a positive effect on patient care, medical knowledge, and
   ABSITE scores, respectively. ABS certification was not analyzed. The
   other ACGME core competencies were addressed in only 6 studies.
   CONCLUSIONS: Several publications on process changes in surgical
   training programs have shown a positive effect on patient care, medical
   knowledge, and ABSITE scores. However, the effect on ABS certification,
   and other quantitative outcomes from residency programs, have not been
   addressed. Studies on education strategies showing evidence that
   residency program objectives are being achieved are still needed.

Title = {Automated analysis of three-dimensional CBCT images taken in natural
   head position that combines facial profile processing and multiple
   deep-learning models},

Abstract = {Background and objectives: Analyzing three-dimensional cone beam
   computed tomography (CBCT) im-ages has become an indispensable procedure
   for diagnosis and treatment planning of orthodontic pa-tients.
   Artificial intelligence, especially deep-learning techniques for
   analyzing image data, shows great potential for medical and dental image
   analysis and diagnosis. To explore the feasibility of automating
   measurement of 13 geometric parameters from three-dimensional cone beam
   computed tomography im-ages taken in natural head position (NHP), this
   study proposed a smart system that combined a facial profile analysis
   algorithm with deep-learning models.Materials and methods: Using
   multiple views extracted from the cone beam computed tomography data of
   170 cases as a dataset, our proposed method automatically calculated 13
   dental parameters by parti-tioning, detecting regions of interest, and
   extracting the facial profile. Subsequently, Mask-RCNN, a trained
   decentralized convolutional neural network was applied to detect 23
   landmarks. All the techniques were integrated into a software
   application with a graphical user interface designed for user
   convenience. To demonstrate the system's ability to replace human
   experts, 30 CBCT data were selected for validation. Two orthodontists
   and one advanced general dentist located required landmarks by using a
   commercial dental program. The differences between manual and developed
   methods were calculated and reported as the errors. Results: The
   intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and 95\% confidence interval
   (95\% CI) for intra-observer reliability were 0.98 (0.97-0.99) for
   observer 1; 0.95 (0.93-0.97) for observer 2; 0.98 (0.97- 0.99) for
   observer 3 after measuring 13 parameters two times at two weeks
   interval. The combined ICC for intra-observer reliability was 0.97. The
   ICCs and 95\% CI for inter-observer reliability were 0.94 (0.91- 0.97).
   The mean absolute value of deviation was around 1 mm for the length
   parameters, and smaller than 2 degrees for angle parameters.
   Furthermore, ANOVA test demonstrated the consistency between the
   mea-surements of the proposed method and those of human experts
   statistically ( F dis= 2.68, alpha = 0.05).Conclusions: The proposed
   system demonstrated the high consistency with the manual measurements of
   human experts and its applicability. This method aimed to help human
   experts save time and effort s f or analyzing three-dimensional CBCT
   images of orthodontic patients.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Problem: The need to increase the number of culturally responsive
   physicians, particularly primary care physicians, serving in rural and
   urban underserved communities is well documented. To address this need,
   an increasing number of medical schools are implementing separate rural
   or urban underserved training programs or tracks. Intervention: The
   Rural and Urban Scholars Pathways program is designed as an integrated
   program, not as separated tracks, and includes critical reflection
   groups, professional development workshops, individual coaching, a
   scholarly project, and immersion experiences. The program does not
   separate students by initial interest in either rural or urban
   underserved practice settings, but rather promotes their interactions
   across all four years. Students can join (or leave) RUSP in any year of
   medical school and, although strongly encouraged toward eventual
   practice in an underserved community, students are not committed to a
   specific specialty or practice location. Context: The RUSP program was
   developed and implemented at the Heritage College of Osteopathic
   Medicine at Ohio University in 2013 with a grant from the Osteopathic
   Heritage Foundations. The program resides within the Office of Rural and
   Underserved Programs at the Heritage College and is one of many medical
   school programs across the country aimed at producing more physicians
   for rural and urban underserved communities. RUSP is now funded by the
   College. Impact: Overall, based on a 60\% return rate in 2019-2020,
   students in all four years report that the RUSP program enhances their
   professional, personal, social, and academic development. Cumulatively,
   67\% have matched into specialties with primary care potential,
   including family medicine, pediatrics, general internal medicine and
   internal medicine-pediatrics. Of the 14 RUSP graduates in practice, six
   are practicing primary care in rural locations and five are practicing
   primary care in urban locations. Five of the fourteen are practicing in
   communities officially designated as underserved. Lessons Learned:
   Offering flexibility via a pathways model promotes continuing individual
   and program growth and expansion. A co-curricular strategy allows for
   nimble program refinement but requires significant volunteer time
   commitment from faculty and staff. Having clear program goals, a logic
   model, and mechanisms for gathering and analyzing student experiences
   help to maintain program focus and allow for ongoing formative and
   periodic summative evaluation of short-term and long-term objectives.},

Abstract = {Medical education fellowship programs (MEFPs) are a form of faculty
   development contributing to an organization's educational mission and
   participants' career development. Building an MEFP requires a systematic
   design, implementation, and evaluation approach which aligns
   institutional and individual faculty goals. Implementing an MEFP
   requires a team of committed individuals who provide expertise,
   guidance, and mentoring. Qualified MEFP directors should utilize
   instructional methods that promote individual and institutional short
   and long term growth. Directors must balance the use of traditional
   design, implementation, and evaluation methodologies with advancing
   trends that may support or threaten the acceptability and sustainability
   of the program. Drawing on the expertise of 28 MEFP directors, we
   provide twelve tips as a guide to those implementing, sustaining, and/or
   growing a successful MEFP whose value is demonstrated by its impacts on
   participants, learners, patients, teaching faculty, institutions, the
   greater medical education community, and the population's health.},

Title = {Promoting physical therapists' use of research evidence to inform
   clinical practice: part 3-long term feasibility assessment of the PEAK
   program},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Month = {MAY 12},
Abstract = {Background: Evidence is needed to develop effective educational programs
   for promoting evidence based practice (EBP) and knowledge translation
   (KT) in physical therapy. This study reports long-term outcomes from a
   feasibility assessment of an educational program designed to promote the
   integration of research evidence into physical therapist practice.
   Methods: Eighteen physical therapists participated in the 6-month
   Physical therapist-driven Education for Actionable Knowledge translation
   (PEAK) program. The participant-driven active learning program consisted
   of four consecutive, interdependent components: 1) acquiring managerial
   leadership support and electronic resources in three clinical practices,
   2) a 2-day learner-centered EBP training workshop, 3) 5 months of guided
   small group work synthesizing research evidence into a locally relevant
   list of, actionable, evidence-based clinical behaviors for therapists
   treating persons with musculoskeletal lumbar conditions-the Best
   Practices List, and 4) review and revision of the Best Practices List,
   culminating in participant agreement to implement the behaviors in
   practice. Therapists' EBP learning was assessed with standardized
   measures of EBP-related attitudes, self-efficacy, knowledge and skills,
   and self-reported behavior at baseline, immediately-post, and 6 months
   following conclusion of the program (long-term follow-up). Therapist
   adherence to the Best Practice List before and after the PEAK program
   was assessed through chart review.
   Results: Sixteen therapists completed the long-term follow-up
   assessment. EBP self-efficacy and self-reported behaviors increased from
   baseline to long-term follow-up (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively).
   EBP-related knowledge and skills showed a trend for improvement from
   baseline to long-term follow-up (p = 0.05) and a significant increase
   from immediate-post to long-term follow-up (p = 0.02). Positive
   attitudes at baseline were sustained throughout (p = 0.208). Eighty-nine
   charts were analyzed for therapist adherence to the Best Practices List.
   Six clinical behaviors had sufficient pre- and post-PEAK charts to
   justify analysis. Of those, one behavior showed a statistically
   significant increase in adherence, one had high pre-and post-PEAK
   adherence, and four were change resistant, starting with low adherence
   and showing no meaningful improvement.
   Conclusions: This study supports the feasibility of the PEAK program to
   produce long-term improvements in physical therapists' EBP-related
   self-efficacy and self-reported behavior. EBP knowledge and skills
   showed improvement from post-intervention to long-term follow-up and a
   trend toward long-term improvements. However, chart review of
   therapists' adherence to the participant generated Best Practices List
   in day-to-day patient care indicates a need for additional support to
   facilitate behavior change. Future versions of the PEAK program and
   comparable multi-faceted EBP and KT educational programs should provide
   ongoing monitoring, feedback, and problem-solving to successfully
   promote behavior change for knowledge translation.},

   English-as-an-Additional Language Backgrounds},

Abstract = {Having a shared language such as English facilitates the globalization
   of science, but it can also limit science by posing barriers for those
   who have learned English-as-an-additional language (Eng+). Research on
   the experiences of Eng+ graduate students and postdoctoral researchers
   ({''}trainees{''}) is needed as our scientific community becomes more
   diverse and continues working toward improving equity and inclusion;
   without such research, we risk losing out on perspectives and expertise
   that might otherwise strengthen scientific progress. We investigated
   three research questions: (1) What are Eng+ chemistry trainees' language
   experiences before entering English-dominant research programs? (2) What
   language barriers have trainees faced in learning, communicating, and
   doing chemistry? and (3) What strategies and supports have been helpful
   or needed? In focus groups and interviews with 18 Eng+ trainees,
   participants described having diverse language experiences before
   entering English-dominant research programs and faced challenges working
   in an English research environment. Participants reported avoiding
   interactions with colleagues, exacerbated feelings of imposter syndrome,
   needing extra time to learn or communicate, and not being able to fully
   express their knowledge. Participants expressed an ongoing desire to
   learn English and described various independent strategies to navigate
   challenges. All participants believed that research supervisors and
   institutions needed to play a larger role in supporting Eng+ trainees,
   such as supervisors who offer personal and professional support, and
   institutional supports that provide chemistry-specific
   knowledge-building and networking opportunities. Based on the findings,
   we recommend approaches that supervisors and institutions can enact that
   may improve linguistic equity in the chemical sciences.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {159218-159261},
Abstract = {In order to improve the performance of the sparrow search algorithm
   (SSA), in this paper, a novel series of SSA variants is proposed by
   combining SSA with improved Tent chaos mutation (IT), Levy flights
   mutation (LF), elite opposition-based learning mutation (EOBL), variable
   radius mutation (VR) and the combination of IT, LF, EOBL, and VR,
   namely, ITSSA, LFSSA, EOBLSSA, VRSSA, and CMSSA, respectively.
   Initially, the performance of these variants is evaluated on a
   comprehensive set of 31 benchmark test functions. Moreover, the
   performance of the best algorithm among these variants is compared with
   19 state-of-the-art optimization algorithms to validate its performance
   on 31 benchmark test functions. The convergence and computational
   complexity of the best variant are also analyzed to test exploration,
   exploitation, and local optima avoidance. It is then employed on eight
   real-world constrained engineering problems to further verify its
   robustness. The experimental results reveal that the best algorithm of
   SSA variants outperforms other competitors and is highly effective in
   solving real-life cases.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To better understand the resident perceived faculty factors
   associated with the promotion of resident operative skill and autonomy
   DESIGN: Qualitative retrospective analysis utilizing anonymous
   open-ended comments from residents on department of surgery faculty
   teaching evaluations and cross references them to observed faculty
   entrustment scores SETTING: Single tertiary midwestern allopathic
   academic medical center using data obtained between January 2016-August
   2019 PARTICIPANTS: Forty-six resident and fourteen faculty surgeons from
   general, plastic, thoracic, and vascular surgery sections. RESULTS:
   Themes of personal traits, the working environment created, and teaching
   techniques employed were identified across resident promoting attendings
   and resident limiting attendings. Promoting attendings employed
   preoperative goal setting, increased operative autonomy, and
   postoperative feedback while creating environments conducive to learning
   by promoting teamwork and collaboration. Alternatively, limiting
   attendings used more ineffective teaching techniques including
   micromanaging, lack of delegation, and treating residents as observers.
   Additionally, trainees described these operating room environments as
   stressful and strained. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative analysis of resident
   teaching evaluations of attending surgeons highlights the importance of
   relationships between learner and teacher, the learning environment, and
   teaching techniques. Continuous professional development pro- grams
   centered on entrustment and promoting behav- iors have the potential to
   disseminate strategies to enhance educator skills among surgeons. ( J

Title = {The construction and evaluation of new educational software for nursing
   diagnoses: a randomized controlled trial},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {36},
Pages = {221-229},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: Student nurses often have difficulties with diagnostic
   inferences. To achieve high accuracy nursing diagnoses, effective
   learning strategies are required.
   Objective: To describe the construction and evaluation of new
   educational software called Wise Nurse, which was developed to increase
   the capacity of student nurses to identify nursing diagnoses (NDx) and
   to establish relationships between NDx, defining characteristics (DC),
   and related factors (RF).
   Design: Randomized controlled trial.
   Setting and Participants: Participants were 2nd to 4th year student
   nurses from an undergraduate program at a university in Brazil. Of the
   47 recruited students, 37 completed the survey.
   Methods: Students were randomly assigned to test the software
   (experimental group) and to solve printed clinical cases (comparison
   group). A pretest and post-test were applied before and after the
   experiment. Statistical analyses of the students' performance in the
   tests were conducted. The primary outcome was the students' progress in
   solving questions and clinical cases regarding NDx. The System Usability
   Scale was used to measure the software's ease of use.
   Results: No significant difference was found between the experimental
   and comparison groups before and after the experiment. The average
   students' performance in identifying RF and NDx was higher than in
   identifying DC The post-test score was higher than the pretest score in
   both groups (P = 0.022). The usability score was good (average score
   83.75, N = 20).
   Conclusion: The use of Wise Nurse supported an improvement in student
   diagnostic reasoning equivalent to that of the traditional NDx training,
   but the software stands out as an innovative teaching tool. (C) 2015

Title = {Multilevel Quality Improvement Teams: An Alternative Approach for
   Surgical Academic Training Programs to Meet ACGME Core Competency
   Milestones},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {76},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quality improvement (QI) activities are an integral part of
   residency training. We started the process to implement team-based,
   multilevel QI project streams within our academic surgical residency by
   studying resident perceptions.
   OBJECTIVE: Our residency carried out 6 QI projects in line with the
   American Council for Graduate Medical Education competencies. A resident
   survey was completed in 2016 to measure resident perceptions of an
   individual versus team-based QI project approach.
   METHODS: This was a descriptive study looking at resident's preference
   for team projects and ongoing projects within the training program. We
   started in 2014 utilizing Wait's Team Action Projects in surgery
   paradigm to conduct 6 QI projects. After initiation of projects, we
   allotted 2 full years to pass prior to assessing resident perceptions
   via a 12-item survey.
   RESULTS: Notably, this was a descriptive study aiming to capture
   resident perceptions on team-based QI and the foundational elements
   necessary to create and sustain such projects by integrating into our
   curriculum from the intern year. In 2016, 40 residents completed surveys
   (72.7\% response rate), all (100\%) opined that they preferred
   team-based approaches over individual ones, and 75\% were on board to
   move forward with only a team-based approach in the future.
   CONCLUSIONS: This was a pivotal start to adopting a team-based QI
   project strategy in the future and laid a solid foundation to build
   upon. We found residents in our program desire to work within teams
   early on to develop effective solutions to clinical problems. Residents
   perceived that the team-based model resulted in an improved resident
   experience with the QI process and improved patient care. We hope to
   publish a series of articles updating our progress as we move forward in
   this endeavor. (C) 2018 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

Title = {Nursing interns' perception of clinical competence upon completion of
   preceptorship experience in Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {68},
Pages = {53-60},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Nursing interns are newly graduate students with limited
   real-life work experiences. These novices are in the process of
   enhancing their competencies in the delivery of quality nursing care
   with the guidance of the preceptors. Hence, it is relevant to examine
   the impact of preceptorship, as a teaching strategy, among nursing
   interns during their preceptorship years in clinical settings.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to determine if the preceptorship
   program has provided the nursing interns the needed education in
   enhancing clinical competence.
   Setting: The study was conducted in one of the tertiary hospitals in
   Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
   Participants: Convenience sampling was used to recruit 92 undergraduate
   nursing interns who have completed the five-years nursing education
   including preceptorship.
   Methods: The nursing interns completely answered the survey
   questionnaires which covers Benner's Competencies, Knowles' Adult
   Learning Theory and the Nursing Process.
   Design: The study followed a mixed-methods design wherein a descriptive
   cross-sectional approach was used to identify factors affecting the
   nursing interne perception towards clinical competence. Two open-ended
   questions referring to the improvement of internship program and
   competency were concurrently collected which was the qualitative portion
   of the study.
   Results: The preceptorship program enhanced the preceptees competencies
   in the clinical setting primarily in priority-setting with acutely ill
   patients, multitasking and demonstrating complex nursing skills. The
   majority of the nursing interns perceived preceptorship as a
   constructive experience. The availability, approachable attitude, and
   trustworthiness of the preceptor were viewed as influential factors in
   improving the interne clinical competence. Variations were significant
   with phases of internship and type of school. Furthermore, results
   showed positive correlation between the nursing interne efficacy and
   clinical competencies in professional behavior, general performance, and
   core nursing skills.
   Conclusion: Preceptorship program positively impacts nursing interne
   skills in handling actual patients in clinical setting. Hence, the
   preceptorship program is an effective teaching strategy which advances
   the novice to the next stage of developing clinical competence.},

Abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to explore the experiences of early career
   academic nurses as they shape their career path in one Australian
   university.
   Background: The early years of academic career development can be
   challenging as individuals learn to adjust to the teaching, research and
   service mission of universities. Tertiary institutions have an
   obligation to provide future nursing leaders with relevant and timely
   support during the formative phase of career development, to be
   successful in a competitive global environment.
   Design: A qualitative descriptive approach was used and data were
   analysed thematically using Braun and Clarke (2006) six phase process.
   Methods: Eleven early career academic nurses who were interviewed, had
   completed, or were near completion of a doctorate and were within seven
   years of full-time academic employment.
   Results: The four themes that emerged from the analysis were: embarking
   on the journey; the toil of the journey; fellow travellers on the
   journey, and strategies for a successful journey.
   Conclusions: Findings from this study can be used to inform customised
   mentorship programs for nurse academics during their initial stage of
   career employment.},

Title = {Faculty Conceptions of Tensions in PBL Implementation in Early
   Undergraduate Engineering Education},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},

Volume = {39},

Pages = {129-141},
Abstract = {Problem-based learning (PBL) is used in upper-level and increasingly in
   earlier years of engineering education. By implementing PBL, comfortable
   routines are disrupted for both educators and students, creating
   tensions. Using a methodological framework of phenomenography, this
   study explored the variation in engineering educators' conception and
   experience of the tensions when implementing PBL in the first two years
   of undergraduate engineering education. Results revealed that
   engineering educators' experiences of implementing PBL in the first two
   years are described by three predominant tensions. Faculty experiences
   of the key tensions associated with the implementation of PBL and their
   conception of these tensions (student, instructor, institutional) play a
   critical role in the development of instructional strategies for
   incorporating PBL into the engineering curriculum in the early years.
   The findings of this study can inform the development of support
   structures and teaching development programs for engineering faculty.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The study of online routing and spectrum allocation (RSA) problem has
   assumed increasing importance due to the exponential growth of dynamic
   traffic with uncertainty in elastic optical networks (EONs). This paper
   first formulates offline RSA as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP)
   with the consideration of the time attribute, and then models online RSA
   by a carefully designed Markov decision process (MDP), including the
   state, action and reward. To deal with such a complex dynamic
   optimization problem, a novel algorithm based on the classic deep
   reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, Deep Q-network (DQN), is
   developed. For further promoting the training efficiency, a dueling
   network architecture, an improved E-greedy strategy and a series of
   parameter adjustments are applied. Simulation results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show its superiority in
   reducing the blocking probability compared with the state of the art,
   which further exhibits the potential of applying DRL to solve such
   complex real-time decision-making problems.},

Title = {Bringing simulation to the classroom using an unfolding video patient
   scenario: A quasi-experimental study to examine student satisfaction,
   self-confidence, and perceptions of simulation design},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},

Abstract = {Background: Teaching strategies to promote experiential learning in the
   classroom are important to facilitate students' clinical reasoning
   abilities. Using video to simulate unfolding patient scenarios in the
   classroom has the potential to engage students through active learning
   and to enhance their ability to connect theory to practice.
   Objectives: Study objectives were to: (1) Evaluate nursing students'
   satisfaction and self-confidence in learning and perceptions of the
   design of a simulated patient scenario delivered via video in the
   classroom and (2) Compare findings to students' satisfaction,
   self-confidence, and perceptions of the design of prior high-fidelity
   simulation experiences in the laboratory.
   Design: A quasi-experimental approach was used.
   Setting: The study setting was a nursing classroom at a University in
   the southeast United States.
   Participants: Convenience sampling was utilized and 54 students in their
   final semester of a pre-licensure baccalaureate nursing program
   participated.
   Methods: The intervention was an unfolding video patient scenario
   delivered in the classroom. Prior to the intervention, participants
   completed two measurement tools to collect information about their
   satisfaction, self-confidence, and perceptions of the design of prior
   high-fidelity simulations. After the intervention, these tools were
   administered again to collect data about the video simulation experience
   in the classroom.
   Results: Participants had a higher level of satisfaction (p = 0.002) and
   self-confidence (p < 0.001) following the classroom intervention than
   for prior high-fidelity simulations in the laboratory. Student
   perceptions of the simulation design were more favorable for the
   classroom intervention than for prior laboratory simulations (p <
   0.001).
   Conclusions: Use of unfolding video patient scenarios in the classroom
   can promote student engagement in learning. Nurse educators should
   consider this teaching strategy that provides students with
   opportunities to connect and apply classroom content to patient care.},

Abstract = {This study investigates an identical parallel machine scheduling problem
   with past-sequence-dependent setup times and general effects of
   deteriorating and learning. The actual job processing time on each
   machine is defined by a two-element function of the normal processing
   times of the preprocessed jobs and its scheduled position on the same
   machine. Moreover, the job setup time on each machine is a function of
   the actual processing times of the preprocessed jobs on the same
   machine. A novel mixed-integer programming model is developed to satisfy
   the goal of minimizing total completion time. Due to the NP-hard
   characteristic and intractability of the problem, three efficient
   methodologies including a heuristic algorithm (HA), a genetic algorithm
   (GA) with an enhanced exploration ability and an ant colony optimization
   (ACO) combined with a new stochastic elitism strategy are designed to
   find optimal/near-optimal solutions within an appropriate period of
   time. The effectiveness and efficiency of the presented model and the
   proposed algorithms are verified by computational experiments. The
   computational results indicate that the suggested algorithms are
   effective and executable approaches to generate solutions as good as
   optimal solution in the small-sized problems. Also, the ACO
   statistically outperformed the HA and GA in the medium- and large-sized
   problems.},

Title = {Preparing pharmacists to deliver a targeted service in hypertension
   management: evaluation of an interprofessional training program},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {Background: Non-adherence to medicines by patients and suboptimal
   prescribing by clinicians underpin poor blood pressure (BP) control in
   hypertension. In this study, a training program was designed to enable
   community pharmacists to deliver a service in hypertension management
   targeting therapeutic adjustments and medication adherence. A
   comprehensive evaluation of the training program was undertaken.
   Methods: Tailored training comprising a self-directed pre-work manual,
   practical workshop (using real patients), and practice scenarios, was
   developed and delivered by an inter-professional team (pharmacists,
   GPs). Supported by practical and written assessment, the training
   focused on the principles of BP management, BP measurement skills, and
   adherence strategies. Pharmacists' experience of the training
   (expectations, content, format, relevance) was evaluated quantitatively
   and qualitatively. Immediate feedback was obtained via a questionnaire
   comprising Likert scales (1 = ``very well{''} to 7 = ``poor{''}) and
   open-ended questions. Further in-depth qualitative evaluation was
   undertaken via semi-structured interviews several months post-training
   (and post service implementation).
   Results: Seventeen pharmacists were recruited, trained and assessed as
   competent. All were highly satisfied with the training; other than the
   `amount of information provided' (median score = 5, ``just right{''}),
   all aspects of training attained the most positive score of `1'.
   Pharmacists most valued the integrated team-based approach, GP
   involvement, and inclusion of real patients, as well as the pre-reading
   manual, BP measurement workshop, and case studies (simulation).
   Post-implementation the interviews highlighted that comprehensive
   training increased pharmacists' confidence in providing the service,
   however, training of other pharmacy staff and patient recruitment
   strategies were highlighted as a need in future.
   Conclusions: Structured, multi-modal training involving simulated and
   inter-professional learning is effective in preparing selected community
   pharmacists for the implementation of new services in the context of
   hypertension management. This training could be further enhanced to
   prepare pharmacists for the challenges encountered in implementing and
   evaluating services in practice.},

Title = {Reforms in VUmc School of Medical Sciences Amsterdam: Student
   engagement, a Minor elective semester and stakeholder collaboration in
   improving the quality of assessments},
Journal = {MEDICAL TEACHER},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {40},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {501-505},
Abstract = {Background: At VUmc School of Medical Sciences, major curricular reforms
   occurred in 2005 and 2015, related to the introduction of a
   Bachelor-Master structure, a new legislation from the Ministry of
   Education, the changing societal context, and taking note of students'
   and teachers' needs.
   Summary of work: Along with the introduction of the Bachelor-Master
   system, the period between 2005 and 2009 saw the movement from
   traditional lecture-based teaching to small group teaching in a
   competency-based curriculum, in which the students were responsible for
   their learning. Student engagement grew through students' designing
   learning modules and conducting some of the teaching. In the Bachelor
   program, an elective ``Minor{''}, was designed to broaden and deepen the
   knowledge of our students beyond the core learning outcomes, in a
   discipline of their choice. The examination board (EB), responsible for
   maintaining the quality of assessment, was split into the General EB,
   which handled overall strategy issues, and the Executive EB, which
   handled student requests and monitored the quality of assessments.
   Lessons learned: Students develop a sense of what education is about if
   they are provided opportunities in designing teaching and conducting it.
   A Minor elective in the medical study can provide the students with an
   opportunity to learn outside the medical field. Collaborative working
   between different stakeholders in a medical school is crucial for
   safeguarding the quality of assessments. Curricular reforms need time to
   be accepted and integrated into the culture of the medical school. The
   educational vision needs to be refreshed regularly in alignment with the
   changing societal context.},

Title = {Physics teaching assistants' views of different types of introductory
   problems: Challenge of perceiving the instructional benefits of
   context-rich and multiple-choice problems},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Physics problems can be posed in different ways. Given a physics
   scenario, different problem types presenting that scenario in various
   ways can emphasize different instructional goals. In this investigation,
   we examined the views of physics graduate teaching assistants (TAs)
   enrolled in a semester-long TA professional development course about the
   instructional benefits of different types of introductory problems based
   upon the same problem scenario to generate discussion and reflection on
   their use in different instructional situations. The TAs were asked to
   list the pros and cons of the problem types, rank them in terms of their
   instructional benefit and the level of challenge they might produce for
   their students, and describe when and how often they would use different
   types of problems in their own classes if they had complete control of
   teaching the class. Here we report on TA's views about two of these
   problem types that were regarded by TAs as the least instructionally
   beneficial of all problem types-the context-rich and multiple-choice
   formats. Many TAs listed no pros at all for these problem types, despite
   being explicitly asked for at least one pro. They viewed multiple-choice
   questions nearly exclusively as tools for high stakes summative
   assessment rather than their possible use as formative assessment tools,
   e.g., as clicker questions even in large classes. Similarly, TAs viewed
   context-rich problems as overly challenging, unnecessarily wordy, and
   too time consuming to be instructionally beneficial to their students.
   It is possible that in the written responses, TAs could have focused on
   the example problems provided to illustrate each problem type.
   Therefore, discussion in the TA professional development class and in
   the follow-up interviews explicitly included a focus on the general
   instructional benefits of well-designed multiple-choice and context-rich
   problems in different instructional contexts based upon the goals. It
   appears that TA's sentiments were general views about these types of
   problems, and not just their views about the specific examples that the
   TAs were given in order to illustrate a problem type. While TA's
   concerns have obvious validity and value, the benefits of well-designed
   multiple-choice questions as a formative assessment tool was not readily
   identified by them, nor did the TAs recognize the learning benefits
   associated with solving context-rich problems. Given the powerful ways
   multiple-choice and context-rich problems can be used for active
   engagement and formative assessment in different instructional contexts
   to meet diverse instructional goals, the lack of enthusiasm for these
   types of problems has implications for future TA professional
   development programs.},

Abstract = {Objective. To examine the effectiveness of simulated learning modules
   (SLMs) encompassing EXcellence in Cultural Experiential Learning and
   Leadership (EXCELL) core competencies in enhancing pharmacy students'
   professional communication skills.
   Methods. Students completed three hours of preparatory lectures and
   eight hours of workshops comprising six SLMs themed around pharmacy
   practice and pharmacy placements. Each SLM comprised role-plays with
   actors, facilitation using EXCELL Social Interaction Maps (SIMs), and
   debriefing. Evaluations of SLMs included quantitative and qualitative
   survey responses collected before, during and after workshops, and after
   placements. Facilitators reflected on SLMs as a pedagogic modality.
   Results. Student feedback was positive about SLMs as an effective
   learning tool. The majority indicated areas of new learning and found
   SLMs enhanced their professional skills and confidence. Facilitator
   feedback was positive, and suggested SLM optimization strategies.
   Conclusion. Student and teaching team recommendations will inform future
   curriculum development including the optimization of SLMs in pharmacy
   education.},

Abstract = {Wireless mesh network (WMN) is one of the most promising technologies
   for Internet of Things (IoT) applications because of its self-adaptive
   and self-organization nature. To meet different performance requirements
   on communications in WMNs, traditional approaches always have to program
   flow control strategies in an explicit way. In this case, the
   performance of WMNs will be significantly affected by the dynamic
   properties of underlying networks in real applications. With providing a
   more flexible solution in mind, in this article, for the first time, we
   present how we can apply emerging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) on
   communication flow control in WMNs. Moreover, different from a general
   DRL based networking solution, in which the network properties are
   pre-defined, we leverage the adaptive nature of WMNs and propose a
   self-adaptive DRL approach. Specifically, our method can reconstruct a
   WMN during the training of a DRL model. In this way, the trained DRL
   model can capture more properties of WMNs and achieve better
   performance. As a proof of concept, we have implemented our method with
   a self-adap-tive Deep Q-learning Network (DQN) model. The evaluation
   results show that the presented solution can significantly improve the
   communication performance of data flows in WMNs, compared to a static
   benchmark solution.},

Abstract = {The ongoing novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has
   created many threats as well as opportunities for the career development
   of physicians-in-training. Institutional responses to the demand for
   patient care reduced the time many residents have to pursue clinical
   electives, scholarship projects, and other experiences meant to clarify
   and advance their personal and professional goals. Moreover, many
   academic medical centers experienced profound fiscal losses that require
   thoughtful revisions to budgets and curricula. In this article, the
   authors recommend strategies for residency programs to mitigate these
   losses and capitalize on growth in virtual education, scholarship
   opportunities, and relationships arising from the pandemic. Drawing from
   career development guidelines from the National Career Development
   Association and existing literature about factors associated with
   positive career outcomes, the authors suggest leadership roles,
   curricula, and events that training programs can quickly and
   inexpensively implement to help residents grow as professionals, achieve
   personal training goals, produce scholarship, and attain future
   employment. To help trainees manage their careers, the authors recommend
   structured mentorship and education in career pathways and the
   preparation of job application materials. To foster attainment of
   specific knowledge and cultivate lifelong learning, the authors
   recommend leveraging existing resources to provide time, funding,
   academic coaching, and skills training for scholarship projects. To
   promote development of effective work relationships and community, the
   authors recommend appointment of a faculty champion for career
   advancement, scholarship showcases, attendance at virtual journal clubs,
   and networking through social media outlets. These recommendations for
   supporting career advancement may apply to early career faculty
   development as well as undergraduate and postgraduate medical education
   beyond the pandemic era. Outcomes studies will be needed to evaluate the
   impact of these recommendations.},

Abstract = {Research in education and physical education has emphasized the need for
   continuing professional development (CPD) programs that are aligned with
   best practices. More specifically, scholars interested in teaching
   personal and social responsibility (TPSR) have emphasized the need to
   examine teachers' CPD. The purpose of this study was to provide a novel
   responsibility-based CPD experience to three physical educators and
   examine its impact on a middle school physical education program in the
   USA. Data were collected through systematic observations, interviews,
   nonparticipant observations and document analysis. Findings showed that
   the physical educators increased their awareness of responsibility-based
   teaching strategies, perceived them to positively impact students and
   integrated the strategies into their teaching. Furthermore, descriptive
   statistics illustrate frequent use of the teaching strategies and
   confirms the reliability of the observation instrument. The findings
   suggest that systematic observations can support responsibility-based
   CPD for the purposes of research, peer evaluations, or as a reflection
   tool. The long-term approach enhanced the potential for sustainability.},

Abstract = {Despite the great success of high-level synthesis (HLS) tools, we
   observe several unresolved challenges: 1) the high-level abstraction of
   HLS programming styles sometimes conceals optimization opportunities; 2)
   the actual quality of resulting RTL designs is hard to predict; and 3)
   existing HLS tools do not provide flexible tradeoff (Pareto) solutions
   among different objectives and constraints. To this end, we propose an
   end-to-end framework, namely, IronMan-Pro. The primary goal is to enable
   a flexible and automated design space exploration (DSE), to provide
   either optimized solutions under user-specified constraints or Pareto
   tradeoffs among different objectives (such as resource types, area, and
   latency). IronMan-Pro consists of three components: 1) GPP, a highly
   accurate graph-neural-network-based performance and resource predictor;
   2) RLMD, a reinforcement-learning-based multiobjective design
   exploration engine for optimal resource allocation strategies, aiming to
   provide Pareto solutions among different objectives; and 3) CT, a code
   transformer to assist RLMD and GPP, which extracts the data flow graphs
   from original HLS C/C++ and automatically generates synthesizable code
   with optimized HLS directives. Experimental results show that, 1) GPP
   achieves high prediction accuracy, reducing the prediction errors of HLS
   tools by 10.9 x in resource utilization and 5.7x in critical path (CP)
   timing; 2) compared with meta-heuristic-based techniques, IronMan-Pro
   generates superior solutions improving resource utilization by 16.0\%
   similar to 29.5\% and CP timing by 7.6\%-16.5\%; and 3) under
   user-specified constraints, IronMan-Pro can find satisfying solutions
   over 96\% of the cases, more than twice as many as that of
   meta-heuristic-based techniques and with a speedup of up to
   \$400\textbackslash{}times \$ . This work demonstrates the great
   potential of applying machine learning algorithms in the electronic
   design automation domain, especially for the hard-to-solve problems,
   such as timing estimation and optimization. IronMan-Pro is available at
   https://github.com/lydiawunan/IronMan.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {142},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Making refers to the hands-on practice of creating technology-based
   artifacts that typically involves things like electronics, programming,
   and 3D printing. Practices in Making have been spearheaded by the rise
   of the Maker movement, resulting in the spread of Makerspaces for both
   young people and adults worldwide. However, Making is also being
   increasingly incorporated into school settings. This is despite the fact
   that little research has evaluated the potential consequences of Making
   in schools. We present a two-year longitudinal study investigating the
   effects of integrating Making into existing school curricula at a public
   elementary school that primarily serves students from underrepresented
   groups in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics). We
   focused on whether engaging in Making led to changes in self efficacy,
   interest, and identification with both Making and science. We further
   examined more distal potential changes in STEM career interest and STEM
   possible selves. Results showed that students exposed to a Making-based
   science curriculum evidenced significant increases in four of the eight
   dependent variables tested (Making self-efficacy, science self-efficacy,
   science identity, and STEM possible selves). These findings demonstrate
   the utility of curriculum-aligned Making, particularly in terms of
   fostering self-efficacy, science identity, and possible selves among
   students from underrepresented groups.},

Abstract = {This two-part laboratory experiment is concerned with investigating key
   aspects of the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction. The first part of
   this experiment utilizes high-throughput experimentation techniques to
   reinforce, explore, and extend fundamental concepts that are presented
   in the classroom. In contrast, the second part employs guided-inquiry
   learning strategies to challenge students to design, set up, and perform
   a preparative-scale Suzuki-Miyaura reaction and suggest workup and
   isolation protocols. By design, this experiment, which represents one of
   the final experiments performed in the third-year undergraduate
   chemistry laboratory program, serves as a capstone learning experience
   for students.},

Abstract = {Innovation performance of regional innovation systems can serve as an
   important tool for policymaking to identify best practices and provide
   aid to regions in need. Accurate forecasting of regional innovation
   performance plays a critical role in the implementation of policies
   intended to support innovation because it can be used to simulate the
   effects of actions and strategies. However, innovation is a complex and
   dynamic socio-economic phenomenon. Moreover, patterns in regional
   innovation structures are becoming increasingly diverse and non-linear.
   Therefore, to develop an accurate forecasting tool for this problem
   represents a challenge for optimization methods. The main aim of the
   paper is to develop a model based on a variant of genetic programming to
   address the regional innovation performance forecasting problem. Using
   the historical data related to regional knowledge base and
   competitiveness, the model should accurately and effectively predict a
   variety of innovation outputs, including patent counts, technological
   and non-technological innovation activity and economic effects of
   innovations. We show that the proposed model outperforms
   state-of-the-art machine learning methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Visual Control Strategies of Surgeons: A Novel Method of Establishing
   the Construct Validity of a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate
   Surgical Simulator},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine novice and expert differences in visual control
   strategies while performing a virtual, reality transurethral resection
   of the prostate (TURP) task and to determine if these differences could
   provide a novel method for assessing construct validity of the
   simulator.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 11 novices (no TURF experience) and 7
   experts (>200 TURPs) completed a virtual reality prostate resection task
   on the TURPsim (Simbionix USA Corp, Cleveland, OH) while wearing an eye
   tracker (ASL, Bedford, MA). Performance parameters and the surgeon's
   visual control strategy were measured and compared between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: Experts resected a greater percentage of prostate than novices
   (p < 0.01) and had less active diathermy time without tissue contact (p
   < 0.01). Experts adopted a target-locking visual strategy, employing
   fewer visual fixations (p < 0.05) with longer mean fixation duration (p
   < 0.005). With multiple learning trials, novices' performance improved
   and the adoption of a more expertlike gaze strategy was observed.
   CONCLUSION: Significant differences between experts and novices in both
   performance and visual control strategy were observed. The study of
   visual control strategies may be a useful adjunct, alongside
   measurements of motor performance, providing a novel method of assessing
   the construct validity of surgical simulators. (C) 2014 Association of

Title = {Efficacy of pedagogical framework in neonatal resuscitation skill
   learning in a resource-limited setting: a randomized controlled trial},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Background: The educational efficacy in neonatal resuscitation relies on
   the subject and teaching strategies. Therefore, it is imperative to test
   diverse educational methods if they are more instructive to engage
   students in active learning and practicing knowledge. Hence, the present
   study aims to investigate the efficacy of a pedagogical framework in
   neonatal resuscitation skill learning among nursing students in a
   resource-limited setting.
   Methods: A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted
   between October 2020 to March 2021. Sixty nursing students in the 3rd
   and 4th year of professional training were randomly allocated to the
   pedagogy and the traditional group. The pedagogy group learned via
   6-step LSPPDM (Learn, See, Practice, Prove, Do, Maintain) pedagogy
   including lectures, video, clinical observation, skill sessions under
   supervision, and self-directed practice. The traditional group learned
   through 2-step (Learn, Practice) method that included lectures and skill
   sessions under supervision. The outcomes measured included technical and
   non-technical skills in neonatal resuscitation. The technical skill
   deals with steps such as stimulation, ventilation, oxygenation,
   intubation, chest compression, medications, and reporting. Non-technical
   skills refer to teamwork skills that focus on the interaction between
   leader and helper. Both skills were measured through previously
   published validated tools two times before and after the intervention by
   blinded assessors in a simulated delivery room.
   Results: Overall, the skill was significantly improved in both groups
   after intervention. Yet, the results showed that the mean difference of
   technical skill score in the pedagogy group (24.3 +/- 3.5) was
   significantly higher (p < 0.001) compared to the traditional group (16.2
   +/- 2.4). Likewise, the mean difference of non-technical skill score in
   the pedagogy (36.9 +/- 1.9) was highly significant (p < 0.001) compared
   to the traditional group (31.2 +/- 1.7).
   Conclusions: The LSPPDM pedagogy was found more effective in enhancing
   technical and non-technical skills in neonatal resuscitation compared to
   the traditional method. The results of this study support the efficacy
   of the 6-step LSPPDM pedagogy in the education of nursing students
   regarding neonatal resuscitation in a resource-limited setting.},

Title = {MemBrain: A deep learning-aided pipeline for detection of membrane
   proteins in Cryo-electron tomograms},

Abstract = {Background and Objective: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is an
   imaging technique that enables 3D visualization of the native cellular
   environment at sub-nanometer resolution, providing unpreceded in-sights
   into the molecular organization of cells. However, cryo-electron
   tomograms suffer from low signal-to-noise ratios and anisotropic
   resolution, which makes subsequent image analysis challenging. In
   partic-ular, the efficient detection of membrane-embedded proteins is a
   problem still lacking satisfactory solu-tions.Methods: We present
   MemBrain - a new deep learning-aided pipeline that automatically detects
   membrane-bound protein complexes in cryo-electron tomograms. After
   subvolumes are sampled along a segmented membrane, each subvolume is
   assigned a score using a convolutional neural network (CNN), and protein
   positions are extracted by a clustering algorithm. Incorporating
   rotational subvolume nor-malization and using a tiny receptive field
   simplify the task of protein detection and thus facilitate the network
   training.Results: MemBrain requires only a small quantity of training
   labels and achieves excellent performance with only a single annotated
   membrane (F1 score: 0.88). A detailed evaluation shows that our fully
   trained pipeline outperforms existing classical computer vision-based
   and CNN-based approaches by a large margin (F1 score: 0.92 vs. max.
   0.63). Furthermore, in addition to protein center positions, Mem -Brain
   can determine protein orientations, which has not been implemented by
   any existing CNN-based method to date. We also show that a pre-trained
   MemBrain program generalizes to tomograms acquired using different
   cryo-ET methods and depicting different types of cells.Conclusions:
   MemBrain is a powerful and annotation-efficient tool for the detection
   of membrane pro-tein complexes in cryo-ET data, with the potential to be
   used in a wide range of biological studies. It is generalizable to
   various kinds of tomograms, making it possible to use pretrained models
   for different tasks. Its efficiency in terms of required annotations
   also allows rapid training and fine-tuning of models. The corresponding
   code, pretrained models, and instructions for operating the MemBrain
   program can be found at: https://github.com/CellArchLab/MemBrain .(c)

Abstract = {BACKGROUNDDeclines in physical activity (PA) in children and youth have
   contributed to increases in childhood overweight and obesity. The Safe
   Routes to School (SRTS) program was developed to promote school active
   transportation (AT) and reverse the trend.
   METHODSAdopting concepts of a realist approach, this article seeks to
   understand strategies of adoption that worked in the Canadian and United
   States context. Inclusion criteria consisted of adoption of SRTS
   program, identification and definition of SRTS, implementation in Canada
   /United States, and partnership identified.
   RESULTSPartnerships focused on increasing the number of children using
   AT to school. With unique political and funding atmospheres, a common
   strategy was developing multilevel comprehensive partnerships to
   mobilize knowledge and resources, as well as to align intervention
   planning. Key successes, tools used to measure success, as well as
   benefits, challenges and lessons learned from partnerships were
   identified.
   CONCLUSIONThis article is the first attempt to examine SRTS at the
   state/provincial/city level to understand key adoption strategies using
   a realist approach. It found collaborative community-research
   partnerships that initiated SRTS and created cultural shifts in
   communities from the individual to policy level. Researchers, schools
   and communities interested in increasing school AT should consider SRTS
   as a valuable approach.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the quality of life and school
   success of adolescent survivors and their classmates. A survey was
   conducted among 21 cancer survived 12-18-year-old children and 95 of
   their classmates by using questionnaires covering (a) characteristics of
   the quality of life; (b) characteristics of the learning process; and
   (c) level of the fear of cancer recurrence. Significant difference was
   found in the field of physical and emotional functions but contrary to
   expected, the members of the control group reported lower values than
   survivor children. Those children that were teased because of cancer
   made friends hardly and got involved in social programs with more
   difficulty. With reference to the level of development of school
   motivation and the use of learning strategies, it was experienced a
   significant difference between the two groups only in the field of
   planning. Our results show that the better the survived children's
   general quality of life is the better results they achieve at school.
   Their learning achievement is influenced to a much bigger extent by
   social functions than their physical disadvantages.},

Abstract = {The Global Software Development (GSD) strategy has introduced many
   benefits into the modern software industry, but it has also created many
   risks that can negatively affect the quality of the final product.
   Moreover, this approach is still in constant evolution and, therefore,
   diverse issues and challenges related to geographical, temporal, and
   sociocultural distances are also present. Therefore, many universities
   around the world are increasing their efforts in creating programs to
   prepare more skilled graduates to work in globally distributed
   environments. However, providing GSD courses among universities
   distributed in different locations is not so profitable and normally
   involves a high number of collaborations among various teachers and
   students that traditional teaching approaches cannot support. In this
   study, the Cadxela tool is presented to enable undergraduate students to
   acquire practical experience in GSD and improve their communication and
   teamwork skills. An empirical evaluation was conducted on Cadxela
   involving students and teachers from five universities in Mexico, Spain,
   Chile, Cuba, and Peru. The participants developed a total of 15 projects
   to experience different problems related to geographical, temporal, and
   sociocultural distances. The obtained results from pre and
   post-evaluations showed that Cadxela can contribute to facilitating the
   development of practical projects on GSD undergraduate courses, while
   students develop their knowledge, social skills associated with this
   topic as well as teamwork and communication skills. Finally, the data
   collected on the teachers' perceptions suggested that Cadxela can also
   be a useful tool for introducing the GSD approach at the undergraduate
   level.},

Title = {Autonomy support environment and autonomous motivation on nursing
   student academic performance: An exploratory analysis},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {44},
Pages = {103-108},

Abstract = {Background: In the U.S., enrollment and graduation rates of
   baccalaureate nursing programs are slowly increasing. Rigorous program
   requirements can be overwhelming for students who may have difficulty
   adjusting to curriculum demands. Faculty who help students to adjust may
   also build a supportive learning environment that promotes autonomous
   motivation, improves engagement, and strengthens academic performance.
   Students may also experience well-being and autonomy when they feel
   supported and when their needs are met.
   Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate nursing students'
   autonomy support environments and autonomous motivation (measured as
   spirituality), and the influence on engagement and academic performance.
   Methods: A cross-sectional correlational design using a convenience
   sample of 150 nursing students in the last year of a baccalaureate
   nursing program was used. Participants were recruited from four
   universities in Florida and data collection occurred over three months.
   Results: All participants were enrolled in the last year of their
   baccalaureate nursing program with an average Grade Point Average (GPA)
   of 336. The-learning climate alone was moderately supportive of student
   motivation (M = 70.60, SD = 18.99). No significant relationship between
   the autonomy support environment and autonomous motivation (r = .034, p
   = .676) was found. Correlations and regression analysis of autonomous
   motivation and work engagement were significant (F (2,147) = 28.28, p =
   .000). Comparison of participant groups from each university
   independently revealed supportive learning environments.
   Conclusions: Strategies to promote autonomy must be developed and
   implemented as a means of ensuring a favorable learning environment.
   Future research may include the investigation of spirituality and
   autonomous motivation as two separate variables. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Medical education literature suggests clinically-integrated teaching may
   be the most effective approach to teach evidence-based practice (EBP).
   Before implementing this educational best practice in rehabilitation
   curricula, it is imperative to better understand the current context,
   barriers and facilitators to teach EBP in rehabilitation from the
   academic to the clinical setting. The aim of this study was to explore
   faculty and preceptors' experiences and perceptions of teaching EBP in
   rehabilitation professions, namely occupational therapy, physical
   therapy and speech-language pathology. We gathered data from seven focus
   groups and an individual interview with a sample of 24 faculty and 15
   preceptors, i.e., clinical supervisors. Data collected were subjected to
   inductive thematic content analysis. We identified three overarching
   themes and corresponding strategies. First, ``Recognizing EBP as a
   multifaceted concept{''} denoted participants' lack of consensus
   regarding the meaning and scope of EBP, and their awareness of such
   discrepancies. Second, ``Complexity of EBP is at the core of teaching
   practices and experiences{''} referred to participants' perception of
   EBP as a complex process involving high-level cognitive skills, which
   influenced their teaching practices and challenged students and
   themselves. Third, ``Connections and divides between research and
   practice{''} represented the limited and delicate connection between
   faculty and preceptors, the factors either bridging or maintaining the
   gap between them, and the impacts of such connections and divides on
   teaching. Improving collaboration between faculty and preceptors
   constitutes an essential first step towards more effective EBP training
   programs in rehabilitation that could be facilitated through online
   communities of practice or integrated knowledge translation research
   projects.},

Title = {A novel neural-inspired learning algorithm with application to clinical
   risk prediction},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS},

Abstract = {Clinical risk prediction - the estimation of the likelihood an
   individual is at risk of a disease - is a coveted and exigent clinical
   task, and a cornerstone to the recommendation of life saving management
   strategies. This is especially important for individuals at risk of
   cardiovascular disease (CVD) given the fact that it is the leading
   causes of death in many developed counties. To this end, we introduce a
   novel learning algorithm - a key factor that influences the performance
   of machine learning-based prediction models - and utilities it to
   develop CVD risk prediction tool. This novel neural-inspired algorithm,
   called the Artificial Neural Cell System for classification (ANCSc), is
   inspired by mechanisms that develop the brain and empowering it with
   capabilities such as information processing/storage and recall, decision
   making and initiating actions on external environment. Specifically, we
   exploit on 3 natural neural mechanisms responsible for developing and
   enriching the brain - namely neurogenesis, neuroplasticity via nurturing
   and apoptosis - when implementing ANCSc algorithm. Benchmark testing was
   conducted using the Honolulu Heart Program (HHP) dataset and results are
   juxtaposed with 2 other algorithms - i.e. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   and Evolutionary Data-Conscious Artificial Immune Recognition System
   (EDC-AIRS). Empirical experiments indicate that ANCSc algorithm
   (statistically) outperforms both SVM and EDC-AIRS algorithms. Key
   clinical markers identified by ANCSc algorithm include risk factors
   related to diet/lifestyle, pulmonary function, personal/family/medical
   history, blood data, blood pressure, and electrocardiography. These
   clinical markers, in general, are also found to be clinically
   significant - providing a promising avenue for identifying potential
   cardiovascular risk factors to be evaluated in clinical trials. (C) 2015

   Participating in Demand Response},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Volume = {11},
Pages = {38291-38300},
Abstract = {Flexible resources such as adjustable load widely participate in
   interaction with power grid, which can effectively promote renewable
   energy consumption. In previous studies, researchers generally focused
   on industrial and household users, but usually ignored the manufacturing
   load. Therefore, in this paper, an day-ahead intelligent energy
   management strategy for manufacturing load is proposed. Firstly, we
   analyze the power demand behavior of manufacturing load in detail, and
   describe the energy flow and material flow of manufacturing load through
   state task network (STN) method and mixed integer linear programming
   model. Then, the conditional deep convolution generative adversarial
   networks (C-DCGAN) algorithm is used to describe the uncertainty of new
   energy and construct a set of scheduling scenarios. Finally, case study
   shows that the proposed method can effectively improve the regional
   renewable energy consumption level and economic benefits of enterprises.},

Title = {A Distance-Learning Course to Improve Drug-Dispensing Behaviors Among
   Brazilian Community Pharmacists},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION},

Volume = {83},

Abstract = {Objective. To evaluate the effectiveness of a distance-learning course
   in the training of pharmacists in drug dispensing.
   Methods. This interventional study was carried out with community
   pharmacists throughout Brazil. A 12-week distance-learning course was
   conducted. Pharmacists' knowledge and performance during drug dispensing
   were evaluated before and after completion of the course.
   Results. Community pharmacists' knowledge of drug dispensing was greater
   after completing the distance-learning course than before (mean=5.7,
   SD=2.8 points vs mean=3.8, SD=1.9 points, respectively). However, no
   improvement was observed in pharmacists' drug-dispensing practice.
   Almost all participants (96.5\%) considered that they were more
   qualified to perform the drug dispensing after the course. There were
   1492 pharmacists enrolled in the course, of which 1061 were included in
   the study, and 472 completed the surveys. Only pharmacists from Ribeirao
   Preto, Brazil, were invited to take the mytery shopper evaluation
   (n=26). However, 10 pharmacists completed the mystery shopper encounter.
   Conclusion. A distance-learning course was effective in improving
   community pharmacists' knowledge. However, the course did not seem to
   improve overall drug-dispensing performance. Additional educational
   strategies should be adopted in future studies to address this gap.},

Title = {Optimal Strategies for Online Advance Selling With Random Rewards-Case
   From China},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {169110-169121},
Abstract = {Advance selling helps retailers who often face a newsvendor problem to
   reduce demand uncertainty. With the development of e-commerce and online
   retailing, online retailers are no longer limited to adopting single
   advance selling strategy. With the support of information technology and
   online payment, the combined strategy of random reward promotion and
   advance selling becomes increasingly easy to apply. In this article, the
   model of online advance selling with random rewards strategy is
   developed based on single advance selling model. The result shows that
   there is a threshold which determines which of the two strategies is
   optimal and the numerical analysis further verifies the research
   results, through comparison and analysis of the advance selling price,
   consumer utility and retailer's total profit of single advance selling
   strategy and advance selling with random rewards strategy. Furthermore,
   the study also finds the effect of the expected utility of random
   rewards on the advance selling price.},

Title = {Rubrics to assess critical thinking and information processing in
   undergraduate STEM courses},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 9},
Abstract = {Background Process skills such as critical thinking and information
   processing are commonly stated outcomes for STEM undergraduate degree
   programs, but instructors often do not explicitly assess these skills in
   their courses. Students are more likely to develop these crucial skills
   if there is constructive alignment between an instructor's intended
   learning outcomes, the tasks that the instructor and students perform,
   and the assessment tools that the instructor uses. Rubrics for each
   process skill can enhance this alignment by creating a shared
   understanding of process skills between instructors and students.
   Rubrics can also enable instructors to reflect on their teaching
   practices with regard to developing their students' process skills and
   facilitating feedback to students to identify areas for improvement.
   Results Here, we provide rubrics that can be used to assess critical
   thinking and information processing in STEM undergraduate classrooms and
   to provide students with formative feedback. As part of the Enhancing
   Learning by Improving Process Skills in STEM (ELIPSS) Project, rubrics
   were developed to assess these two skills in STEM undergraduate
   students' written work. The rubrics were implemented in multiple STEM
   disciplines, class sizes, course levels, and institution types to ensure
   they were practical for everyday classroom use. Instructors reported via
   surveys that the rubrics supported assessment of students' written work
   in multiple STEM learning environments. Graduate teaching assistants
   also indicated that they could effectively use the rubrics to assess
   student work and that the rubrics clarified the instructor's
   expectations for how they should assess students. Students reported that
   they understood the content of the rubrics and could use the feedback
   provided by the rubric to change their future performance. Conclusion
   The ELIPSS rubrics allowed instructors to explicitly assess the critical
   thinking and information processing skills that they wanted their
   students to develop in their courses. The instructors were able to
   clarify their expectations for both their teaching assistants and
   students and provide consistent feedback to students about their
   performance. Supporting the adoption of active-learning pedagogies
   should also include changes to assessment strategies to measure the
   skills that are developed as students engage in more meaningful learning
   experiences. Tools such as the ELIPSS rubrics provide a resource for
   instructors to better align assessments with intended learning outcomes.},

Abstract = {Supply Chain Management is taught in many business and Industrial
   Engineering programs. In this paper we present our experience in using
   gamification in several university courses in this domain. More
   importantly, we present gamification design principles. In these courses
   we used the Supply Chain Simulator (SCS)-a new and innovative web based
   computer gaming/simulation application. Its goal is to enable students
   to gain a better understanding of supply chain management by providing a
   gaming oriented, virtual environment experience, enabling the simulation
   of a large variety of realistic and pragmatic situations. The instructor
   can build an unlimited number of scenarios. Students learn how to
   simultaneously consider diverse supply chain aspects such as costs,
   ordering policies, transportation modes, capacity, and uncertainty.
   Advanced students learn how to design and develop supply chain scenarios
   based on real or imaginary situations. This training approach using
   simulation has already been used to bring gamification into a number of
   courses and the students' satisfaction has been consistently positive.
   Gamification develops students' analytical abilities in conjunction with
   providing tangible experience in handling practical potential challenges
   in a fun gaming environment. We argue that gamification tools should be
   focused on a single domain and allow wide modelling flexibility within
   this domain.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The learning benefits associated with residents teaching peers
   and junior trainees are well documented. However, the concept of Reverse
   Educational Distance (RED), when residents teach an academically senior
   audience, is poorly described. Methods: We explored Pediatric residents'
   and community health care providers' (cHCPs) perceptions of a RED
   teaching intervention, whereby residents would engage in teaching cHCPs.
   We explored the anticipated learning benefits, challenges, and ways to
   optimize its implementation in a residency program. We conducted a
   descriptive qualitative study with focus groups. We also compared RED
   with the traditional Resident-As-Teacher (RAT) approach from a
   theoretical framework perspective. Results: Benefits anticipated by
   residents included: (1) optimizing their incentive to learn; (2)
   focusing on the practical `real-world application' of knowledge; and (3)
   a better understanding of community practice. Benefits anticipated by
   cHCPs included: (1) being updated on evidence-based practices; and (2)
   improving collaboration between cHCPs and future pediatricians. The
   major anticipated challenge was the residents' lack of clinical
   experience, for which key solutions were proposed. Conclusions: Engaging
   residents in teaching cHCPs could lead to enhanced and unique learning
   benefits compared to the traditional RAT approach. RED is a promising
   strategy for RAT curricula aiming at best preparing trainees for their
   future role as educators.},

Title = {Data-driven strategies for extractive distillation unit optimization},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {167},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We provide insights for the development of a fast, dynamic, and adaptive
   way of modeling and optimizing chemical processes. We investigate two
   data-driven methodologies to optimize the energy cost of an extractive
   distillation process using an Aspen simulator. The first method uses
   surrogate-based optimization to explore two model-building techniques:
   Automated Learning of Algebraic Models's (ALAMO) generalized linear
   models and neuron network models with rectifier (ReLU) activation
   function. We compare the accuracy and performance of these models when
   embedded into mathematical programming models. The second approach uses
   black-box optimization (BBO) to optimize problems directly using
   simulation results. We compare four BBO solvers and three different
   penalty functions to address constraints. We find that ALAMO performs
   well for a less complex system, whereas the ReLU network performs better
   for a more complex one. BBO with a smooth penalty function for
   constraints is the more effective approach for problems considered in
   this study.},

Title = {Query Join Order Optimization Method Based on Dynamic Double Deep
   Q-Network},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A join order directly affects database query performance and
   computational overhead. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can explore
   efficient query plans while not exhausting the search space. However,
   the deep Q network (DQN) suffers from the overestimation of action
   values in query optimization, which can lead to limited query
   performance. In addition, e-greedy exploration is not efficient enough
   and does not enable deep exploration. Accordingly, in this paper, we
   propose a dynamic double DQN (DDQN) order selection method(DDOS) for
   join order optimization. First, the method models the join query as a
   Markov decision process (MDP), then solves the DRL model by integrating
   the network model DQN and DDQN weighting into the DRL model's estimation
   error problem in query joining, and finally improves the quality of
   developing query plans. And actions are selected using a dynamic
   progressive search strategy to improve the randomness and depth of
   exploration and accumulate a high information gain of exploration. The
   performance of the proposed method is compared with those of dynamic
   programming, heuristic algorithms, and DRL optimization methods based on
   the query set Join Order Benchmark (JOB). The experimental results show
   that the proposed method can effectively improve the query performance
   with a favorable generalization ability and robustness, and outperforms
   other baselines in multi-join query applications.},

Title = {Nursing faculty academic incivility: perceptions of nursing students and
   faculty},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {DEC 13},
Abstract = {Background: Incivility in nursing education can adversely affect the
   academic environment, the learning outcomes, and safety. Nursing faculty
   (NF) and nursing students (NS) contribute to the academic incivility.
   Little is known about the extent of NF academic incivility in the Middle
   East region. This study aimed at exploring the perceptions and extent of
   NF academic incivility in an undergraduate nursing program of a public
   university in Oman.
   Methods: A cross sectional survey was used to collect data from 155
   undergraduate NS and 40 NF about faculty academic incivility. Data was
   collected using the Incivility in Nursing Education Survey.
   Results: The majority of NS and NF had similar perceptions about
   disruptive faculty behaviors. The incidence of faculty incivility was
   low (Mean = 1.5). The disruptive behaviors with the highest incidence
   were arriving late for scheduled activities, leaving schedule activities
   early, cancelling scheduled activities without warning, ineffective
   teaching styles and methods, and subjective grading. The most common
   uncivil faculty behaviors reported by participants were general taunts
   or disrespect to other NF, challenges to other faculty knowledge or
   credibility, and general taunts or disrespect to NS.
   Conclusion: The relatively low level of NF academic incivility could
   still affect the performance of some students, faculty, and program
   outcomes. Academic institutions need to ensure a policy of zero
   tolerance to all academic incivility, and regular monitoring and
   evaluation as part of the prevention strategies.},

Title = {Measuring changes in nursing students' workplace performance following
   feedback encounters: A quasi-experimental study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {121},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background: Work-integrated learning and performance is intimately
   linked with assessment and feedback; however, empirical evidence
   concerning the impact of feedback on student performance in workplace
   settings is limited. A novel practice-based feedback intervention-the
   REMARK (nuRse fEedback iMplementAtion frameworRK) program-was developed
   and implemented. Sustainable feedback processes that involve both
   learners and learning partners can ultimately maximise learning
   outcomes, optimise self-regulation, and impact performance.Objectives:
   To determine the impact of implementing an educational intervention
   based on best practice principles of feedback on undergraduate nursing
   student performance during clinical placements in acute healthcare
   settings.Methods: A non-equivalent, quasi-experimental design was used.
   A pre- and post-assessment strategy for both control and intervention
   groups was employed. The REMARK program was based on known attributes of
   effective feedback critiqued in the literature that foster interactions
   between a learner and learning partner and, hence, support dialogic
   feedback.Results: Clinical assessment data of 214 final-year nursing
   students collected at three time points were analysed. Using
   multivariate modelling, the results indicated that students
   participating in the REMARK programme (intervention group) had
   statistically higher performance scores than students in the control
   group when time and placement setting were controlled.Conclusions: This
   research provides evidence that engagement with an intervention based on
   attributes of effective feedback improves nursing students' workplace
   performance during clinical placement. To achieve the greatest
   advantage, incorporating strategies that encourage students to adopt an
   active role in feedback conversations that relate to the student's
   learning goals are recommended.},

Title = {Health professions faculty beliefs, confidence, use, and perceptions of
   organizational culture and readiness for EBP: A cross-sectional,
   descriptive survey},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},

Abstract = {Background Evidence-based practice (EBP) is an essential skill and
   ethical obligation for all practicing health professions clinicians
   because of its strong association with improved health outcomes.
   Emerging evidence suggests that faculty who prepare these clinicians
   lack proficiency to teach EBP.
   Objectives: The purpose of this study was to describe; 1) health
   profession faculty beliefs about and confidence in their ability to
   teach and implement EBP, 2) use of EBP for education, 3) organizational
   culture and readiness for EBP; and to determine whether relationships
   exist among these variables.
   Design: This study used a cross-sectional, descriptive survey design.
   Setting and Participants: College of Nursing (CON) and College of Health
   Professions (CHP) faculty from a university located in the Northeast,
   United States. Faculty were defined as anyone teaching a course for the
   CON or CHP during the fall of 2016.
   Methods: Faculty were invited to complete an electronic survey measuring
   EBP beliefs, EBP use, and EBP organizational culture and readiness. The
   survey was comprised of three tools developed specifically for health
   professions educators in 2010 by Fineout-Overholt \& Melnyk.
   Results: Sixty-nine faculty returned usable surveys (25.5\% response
   rate). Mean EBP beliefs score was 89.49 (SD = 10.94) indicating
   respondents had a firm belief in and confidence in their ability to
   implement and teach EBP. Mean EBP use was 32.02 (SD = 20.59) indicating
   that respondents taught and implemented EBP between 1 and 3 times in the
   last 8-weeks. Mean EBP culture and readiness score was 90.20 (SD =
   15.23) indicating essential movement toward a sustainable culture of
   college-wide integration of EBP. Mean scores for beliefs/confidence were
   higher for full-time clinical faculty compared to other groups
   {[}F-(2,F- 55) = 0.075, p = 0.928; eta P-2 = 0.003)]. Adjunct faculty
   reported higher EBP behaviors expected by health profession educators in
   the last 8-weeks compared to other groups {[}F-(2,F- 55) = 0.251, p =
   0.779; eta p(2). = 0.009)]. Adjunct faculty had the highest mean scores
   on OCRSIEP-E followed by full-time clinical faculty. These group
   differences in OCRSIEP-E were statistically significant {[}F-(2,F- 49) =
   7.92, p = 0.001; eta P-2 = 0.244)]. OCRSIEP-E was significantly
   different between full-time tenure/tenure track faculty (M = 78.0, SD =
   12.58) and full-time clinical faculty (M = 91.37, SD = 14.79, p = 0.027)
   and between full-time tenure/tenure track faculty and adjunct faculty (M
   = 97.19, SD = 12.39, p = 0.001).
   Conclusions: Faculty adoption of EBP as a foundational pillar of
   teaching is essential. Research is needed to define the scope of the
   problem internationally. Organizations need to set standards for faculty
   teaching in the health professions to be EBP proficient. Programs
   preparing faculty to teach in nursing and other health professions must
   include educator EBP competencies.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To provide a framework for a virtual curriculum during the
   COVID-19 pandemic for medical student educators that introduces and
   teaches clinical concepts important in urology and surgical specialties
   in general.
   METHODS: We created a 1-week virtual urology course utilizing
   interactive lectures, case-based exercises, and faculty-proctored
   surgical video reviews. Students were assigned self-study modules and
   participated in case based discussions and presentations on a topic of
   their choice. Students' perceptions of urology as a specialty and the
   utility of the course was evaluated through pre and postcourse surveys.
   Understanding of urologic content was evaluated with a multiple-choice
   exam.
   RESULTS: A total of nine students were enrolled in the course. All
   students reported increased understanding of the common urologic
   diagnoses and of urology as a specialty by an average of 2.5 points on a
   10-point Likert scale (Cohen's measure of effect size: 3.2).
   Additionally, 56\% of students reported increased interest, 22\%
   reported no change and 22\% reported a decreased interest in pursuing
   urology as a specialty following the course. Students self-reported
   increased knowledge of a variety of urologic topics on a 10-point Likert
   scale. The average exam score on the multiple-choice exam improved from
   50\% before the course to 89\% after the course.
   CONCLUSIONS: Various teaching techniques can be employed through a
   virtual platform to introduce medical students to the specialty of
   urology and increase clinical knowledge surrounding common urologic
   conditions. As the longevity of the COVID-19 pandemic becomes
   increasingly apparent and virtual teaching is normalized, these
   techniques can have far-reaching utility within the traditional medical
   student surgical curriculum. ((C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on

Abstract = {This paper presents the development of an educational platform with
   serious gameplay to support introductory programming learning. On one
   hand, it presents the technical aspects of the environment and, on the
   other hand, based on an experimental study done, it identifies students'
   behavior and attitudes when playing on their own initiative. We want to
   verify the relations between students' performance and their engagement,
   satisfaction, and problem-solving strategies. The understanding of these
   relations may help to identify students' characteristics that may point
   out to the teacher the need for individualized support.},

Title = {The Creativity Challenge Game: An educational intervention for

   Communication Technologies (ICTs)},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Creativity enhancement is an educational objective. The integration of
   Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) into the curriculum is
   another goal of many educators. In this study a creativity enhancement
   intervention was conducted with participants students (N = 90, 46 male,
   44 female) of mean age M = 18.38, in an information systems course. A
   quasi experimental design was employed and the proposed method included
   the extensive use of Facebook, a collaborative team structure, a
   game-like competitive environment, questions generation and answering.
   Creativity was measured with several pre-post divergent thinking tests.
   Academic achievement was obtained through exam results. Additional data
   were collected with online questionnaires. Results show that the
   intervention was overall effective in stimulating creativity. There was
   a statistically significant increase in fluency, flexibility,
   elaboration and originality, as measured by divergent thinking tests.
   Total student creativity calculated with the use of principal component
   analysis showed a significant positive link to academic achievement and
   ICT knowledge. Students with almost zero Facebook usage exhibited the
   highest levels of creativity followed closely by their peers with the
   highest Facebook usage. Creativity enhancement was not related to
   Facebook usage or ICT knowledge. Results and implications are discussed,
   and propositions for future research are offered.},

Abstract = {Speaker recognition is related to human biometrics dealing with the
   identification of speakers from their speech. Speaker recognition is an
   active research area and being widely investigated using artificially
   intelligent mechanisms. Though speaker recognition systems were
   previously constructed using handcrafted statistical means of machine
   learning, currently it is being shifted to state-of-the-art deep
   learning strategies. Further, deep learning being a fast-paced domain,
   an absence of comprehensive survey is observed in the current deep
   speaker recognition technologies. In this paper, we focus on deep
   speaker recognition technologies. The paper particularly introduces a
   taxonomy, explains the progress, architectural strategies and processes
   of some distinctive approaches. Further, the manuscript classifies and
   enlists the currently available datasets and programming tools. Finally,
   the paper investigates the challenges and future directives of deep
   speaker recognition technology.},

Abstract = {Objective: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) affects an estimated 39 million
   people worldwide and is the most common acquired heart disease in
   children and young adults. Echocardiograms are the gold standard for
   diagnosis of RHD, but there is a shortage of skilled experts to allow
   widespread screenings for early detection and prevention of the disease
   progress. We propose an automated RHD diagnosis system that can help
   bridge this gap.
   Materials and Methods: Experiments were conducted on a dataset with 11
   646 echocardiography videos from 912 exams, obtained during screenings
   in underdeveloped areas of Brazil and Uganda. We address the challenges
   of RHD identification with a 3D convolutional neural network (C3D),
   comparing its performance with a 2D convolutional neural network (VGG16)
   that is commonly used in the echocardiogram literature. We also propose
   a supervised aggregation technique to combine video predictions into a
   single exam diagnosis.
   Results: The proposed approach obtained an accuracy of 72.77\% for exam
   diagnosis. The results for the C3D were significantly better than the
   ones obtained by the VGG16 network for videos, showing the importance of
   considering the temporal information during the diagnostic. The proposed
   aggregation model showed significantly better accuracy than the majority
   voting strategy and also appears to be capable of capturing underlying
   biases in the neural network output distribution, balancing them for a
   more correct diagnosis.
   Conclusion: Automatic diagnosis of echo-detected RHD is feasible and,
   with further research, has the potential to reduce the workload of
   experts, enabling the implementation of more widespread screening
   programs worldwide.},

   description},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {92},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: E-learning is a common method of continuing education for
   nurses that supports professional competencies and learning needs.
   However, variations in setting, information technology, and quality of
   the e-learning may impact these experiences.
   Objective: To explore registered nurses' perceptions of e-learning in a
   hospital setting.
   Design: A qualitative study using an Interpretive Description
   methodology.
   Setting: A small urban Northeastern Ontario hospital.
   Participants: Ten registered nursing staff from acute medical and
   surgical inpatient departments.
   Method: Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted to
   explore nurses' e-learning perceptions. Interview transcripts were
   analyzed for themes. Results: Three key themes were found that described
   the participants' perceptions of e-learning and how it related to their
   continuing education: Unsatisfactory, Meaningful, and Enhancing learning
   experiences.
   Conclusion: E-learning can be a useful method of continuing education
   for registered nurses; however, there are challenges in the delivery of
   e-learning and an ongoing need for quality development.},

Abstract = {The Alabama Comprehensive Cancer Control Coalition (ACCCC) has developed
   an integrated and coordinated approach to reducing cancer incidence,
   morbidity, and mortality, and to improving the quality of life for
   cancer survivors, their families, and their caregivers. The ACCCC is
   currently in a maintenance phase and a formal plan for sustainability of
   the coalition was needed to keep the members engaged and productive. A
   training session in coalition sustainability conducted in 2013
   identified the following elements as essential to success: (1) increased
   marketing of the coalition by simplifying its mission; (2) improved
   networking including flexibility in coalition meeting location and
   attendance; (3) increased membership satisfaction through
   transformational leadership; (4) revision of the working structure of
   committees and improved accountability; and (5) enhancement of partner
   satisfaction with coalition activities designed to recruit and retain
   new partners. A self-administered membership satisfaction survey was
   given to assess coalition mission, meeting logistics, organization,
   capacity building, and coalition goals. Results indicated that the
   subcategories of communication, mission, and meeting logistics were
   rated satisfied to very satisfied on a five-point scale. Although the
   ACCCC had clearly written goals, improvement could be made in leadership
   participation and new member orientation could be improved. Most members
   rated their parent organization as highly involved with the ACCCC and
   many offered suggestions on capacity building. Results of the
   sustainability training have clarified the ACCCC's plans to ensure
   coalition viability and improve strategies to inform stakeholders of the
   benefits of participation in the coalition.},

Title = {Translation of an evidence-based virtual reality simulation-based
   interprofessional education into health education curriculums: An
   implementation science method},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {110},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: The development of interprofessional competencies through an
   evidence-based program is paramount to nurture a collaborative
   practice-ready workforce for patient-centered care and safety. Aims: To
   describe an implementation science approach for translation of an
   evidence-based virtual reality simulation-based interprofessional
   education (VR-Sim-IPE) program into medical and nursing curriculums, and
   to evaluate the implementation outcomes. Methods: Implementation
   strategies from the ``Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change{''}
   were used to support implementation of the VR-Sim-IPE program. This
   included recruiting and training 28 practicing clinicians as
   facilitators to deliver the program to 599 medical and nursing students.
   Proctor's conceptual framework for implementation outcomes was applied
   with multiple data collection methods to evaluate the VR-Sim-IPE
   program. An online survey was administered to measure the levels of
   acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and adoption. Forty-four
   sessions of structured observations were carried out to examine the
   facilitators' implementation fidelity. Individual interviews were
   conducted with 15 facilitators to identify the facilitators and barriers
   to the program implementation. An implementation cost analysis was also
   conducted. Results: Both facilitators and students had positive
   perceptions of the acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, and
   feasibility of the VR-Sim-IPE program. Facilitators were observed to
   implement the program with high fidelity, including program adherence,
   dosage, quality of delivery, and student responsiveness. While
   opportunities to contribute and learn, as well as receiving training and
   support, were identified as facilitators to implementation, the lack of
   familiarity with the virtual environment, varying levels of student
   participation, and facilitating interprofessional groups were reported
   barriers. The implementation costs amounted to USD45,648.50. Conclusion:
   The evaluation of implementation outcomes identifies strategies for
   future implementation that could potentially enhance program acceptance,
   reduce implementation cost, improve penetration, and achieve program
   sustainability. These include increasing facilitation group size,
   preparing students to be active participants, and incorporating
   interprofessional facilitation skills in facilitators' training.},

Abstract = {Development of an effective strategy for promoting science education and
   professional development of K-12 science educators is a national
   priority to strengthen the quality of science, technology, engineering,
   and mathematics (STEM) education. This article reports the outcomes of a
   Geoscience Professional Development Program (GPDP) workshop organized
   for targeted middle and high school science educators in Forsyth and
   Guilford County, North Carolina. The objective of the GPDP workshop was
   to promote hands-on experience for K-12 science educators in the use of
   modern analytical techniques and instrumentation in geoscience education
   for the analysis of Salem Lake water in a guided-inquiry setting.
   Current pedagogy and innovative curriculum development to promote
   students' success in K-12 science education were also discussed. The
   expectations and challenges of first-year college students in STEM
   fields and methods of resolving these challenges were highlighted at the
   workshop to alert the teachers to the specific areas where more efforts
   are needed at the K-12 science education level. The workshop also served
   as an avenue where the specific needs and challenges of classroom
   instruction and technology in K-12 science education and strategies to
   resolve these challenges were discussed. The GPDP aimed to transform the
   knowledge gained from the workshop into the foundation for establishing
   effective STEM curricula at K-12 schools, ultimately motivating students
   in pursuing careers in STEM fields. A follow-up survey of GPDP
   participants indicated that 25\% of the participants have already
   incorporated some aspects of the knowledge gained from the workshop into
   their courses in the middle and high school curricula. The majority of
   the participants also found the GPDP to be very exciting and highly
   beneficial to their professional development.},

   PRN Curriculum},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTINUING EDUCATION IN THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {2},
Pages = {135-143},
Abstract = {Introduction: Cultural transformation is needed for health care to be
   sensitive to children's pain. The Pediatric Pain Practice Registered
   Nurses (PRN) Curriculum is the first free, open access, downloadable,
   interprofessional pain continuing education (IPPCE) curriculum developed
   to empower health care professionals to translate evidence-based pain
   care into clinical practice. To evaluate the curriculum and its
   experiential flipped-learning strategies, we used a mixed methods
   approach. Methods: Interprofessional pediatric teams from eight health
   care systems evaluated the curriculum after attending Pediatric Pain PRN
   Courses in the Fall of 2017 (N = 90). Qualitative methods were used to
   evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and utility of the curriculum
   and IPPCE strategies. Pain knowledge and attitudes were measured
   pre-IPPCE/post-IPPCE with the Pediatric Healthcare Provider's Knowledge
   \& Attitude Survey Regarding Pain (PHPKAS). Web analytics were used to
   describe dissemination for the first year after the curriculum's webpage
   launch. Results: Learners rated their achievement of course objectives
   as moderate-great. PHPKAS scores significantly increased (P < .0005);
   but significant differences in physician and nurse PHPKAS question
   responses pre-IPPCE/post-IPPCE were found. Within 2 years of the IPPCE,
   three health care systems were certified as Childkind Hospitals, five
   Pediatric Pain PRN Programs were established, and various practice
   changes and improved patient outcomes, such as decreased hospital
   lengths of stay and emergency department returns for pain, were
   realized. Curriculum dissemination was global. Discussion: Results
   support the acceptability, effectiveness, feasibility, utility, and
   global dissemination of the curriculum and IPPCE strategies. More
   rigorous patient outcome data are needed; however, this study
   demonstrated the benefit of a free, open-access, downloadable,
   interprofessional health care provider continuing education curriculum.},

Abstract = {High levels of physical inactivity are evident among many American
   children. To address this problem, providing physical activity (PA)
   during the school day within the CSPAP framework, is one strategy to
   increase children's PA. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine
   the effects of a classroom-based PA program on children's PA. Two
   hundred and ten students from one school participated in TAKE 10! for 12
   weeks. All students wore pedometers and a sample of 64 students wore
   accelerometers for 4 days during week 1 (baseline), week 8
   (midintervention), and week 12 (end-intervention). Data were analyzed
   using repeated-measures ANOVA. The results showed that students' daily
   in-school step counts increased by 672 steps from baseline to
   midintervention (P < .001). Students' moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA
   (MVPA) increased by approximately 2 minutes from baseline to
   end-intervention (P < .01). In conclusion, participating in TAKE 10!
   helps children strive toward the goal of recommended daily MVPA.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the second year of a multi-year study on the
   implementation of Peer Instruction and PeerWise-inspired pedagogies in a
   physics methods course in a teacher education program at a large
   research university in Western Canada. In the first year of this study,
   Peer Instruction was implemented consistently in the physics methods
   course and teacher candidates were asked to submit five conceptual
   multiple-choice questions as a final assignment. In the second year of
   the study we incorporated PeerWise online tool to facilitate teacher
   candidates' design of conceptual questions by allowing them to provide
   and receive feedback from their peers, and consequently improve their
   questions. We have found that as a result of this collaboration teacher
   candidates improved their pedagogical content knowledge as measured by
   the rubric developed for the study.},

Abstract = {There are few graduate programs available for pursuing a doctorate in
   anatomy where students gain specific training in gross anatomy
   dissection and the responsibilities of a medical educator. In light of
   this fact, the University of Kentucky created a Graduate Certificate in
   Anatomical Sciences Instruction in 2006. This 12-credit hour curriculum
   includes detailed training in gross anatomy and/or neuroscience courses,
   practicum experiences, a seminar class in pedagogical literature, and a
   course in educational strategies for the anatomical sciences. The award
   of certificate completion affirms that the candidate has demonstrated
   faculty-supervised proficiency in anatomy dissection, instruction in
   anatomy topics, and teaching strategies for anatomy. Seventeen graduate
   students have earned the certificate since its inception; nine students
   accepted teaching positions in anatomy following their graduate training
   and currently nine certificate graduates have assistant (six) or
   associate (three) professor positions in academia. In 2016, an anonymous
   survey including Likert-style and open-ended questions was emailed to
   all certificate graduates. Graduates favorably responded (each question
   averaged 4.4 or greater out of 5) that the certificate increased their
   awareness of teaching-faculty responsibilities, adequately prepared them
   for teaching-related duties, and positively contributed toward their
   first employment. Graduates indicated that the lecturing and dissection
   experience, awareness of faculty responsibilities, and job preparation
   (e.g., teaching philosophy development) were the most helpful aspects of
   the certificate. These results indicate that the Graduate Certificate in
   Anatomical Sciences Instruction is viewed by its graduates and their
   employers as a valuable teaching credential that can be attained
   alongside a basic science degree. Anat Sci Educ 11: 516-524. (c) 2018

Abstract = {Objective: To determine preferred policies and programs to prevent
   obesity and diabetes as identified by parents and caregivers of 3- to
   5-year-old Latino children.
   Design: Constructs from the Social Ecological Model were used to develop
   10 focus group and key informant interview questions.
   Setting: Community venues and schools in St Paul, MN.
   Participants: A total of 64 parents and caregivers and 20 key informants
   provided comments.
   Intervention(s): Community-based participatory research methods were
   used to gather opinions regarding appropriate and preferred methods to
   prevent obesity and diabetes among Latino youth. Native Spanish-speaking
   investigators who were members of the community conducted 7 focus groups
   (60-90 minutes each) and 20 key informant interviews.
   Main Outcome Measures: Themes and subthemes of preferences based on
   participant comments.
   Analysis: Transcript-based, long-table qualitative analysis.
   Results: Five themes were identified: (1) cultural beliefs and practices
   are inconsistent with obesity prevention; (2) cost and convenience; (3)
   positive parenting practices; (4) we want to learn more about being
   healthy; and (5) gardens, parks, gyms, and school meals. At least 1
   theme fell within each of the Social Ecological Model domains.
   Conclusions and Implications: Our results suggest that parents of young
   Hispanic children prefer that obesity and diabetes prevention programs
   address multiple levels of influence.},

Title = {A comprehensive study on reinforcement learning application for train
   speed profile optimization},
Journal = {MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 21},
Abstract = {Optimizing energy consumption in public transportation systems is a
   severe issue as the cost of energy increases over time. Since a palpable
   part of energy in transportation systems is consumed by subways, this
   issue has increased concerns over time. In this paper, the problem of
   train speed profile determination is discussed under the framework of
   Reinforcement Learning. First, the train dynamics are modeled, and the
   basics of RL are explained for the problem. As the novelty of this work,
   a new RL algorithm named Q-SARSA is proposed by incorporating the
   Q-learning and SARSA update rules. This helps Q-SARSA be as fast as
   SARSA and as accurate as Q-learning. The algorithm is prevented from
   local optimums by defining a new parameter as convergence measurement
   (CM). Furthermore, another RL-based method is designed called Deep-Q
   network by combining a deep, fully connected neural network with Q-table
   using Q-SARSA updates. This Deep-Q net relieves the problem of iterative
   calculations by adapting gradient ascend in networks weight updates, and
   a new reward function is formed to accord with the network and the
   time-energy problem. The conventional Q-learning and SARSA algorithms,
   latest versions of Genetic algorithm, Bees algorithm, Dynamic
   programming and Deep neural network are developed as well for comparison
   purposes. Simulations are conducted using the route information of
   Tehran Metro Lines 3, 5, and Shiraz Metro Line 1. The consulting results
   show the proposed methods' huge advantage and efficiency compared with
   the mentioned methods.},

Abstract = {The environmental energy harvesting is adjudged as a reliable solution
   to power the wireless nodes for infinite time and assuring uninterrupted
   operation of deployed network nodes. But uncertain energy availability
   initiates an important research issue of energy management in
   rechargeable sensor nodes. An integrated approach of energy assignment
   principles with adaptive duty cycling has been proposed to efficiently
   utilize the available energy and to maximize the node performance. The R
   interface based machine learning ensemble approach has been used for
   solar irradiance prediction to pre-estimate the node duty cycle. Dynamic
   programming based optimization problem has been used for real time
   adaption of pre-computed node duty cycle. The effectiveness of proposed
   work has been validated using MATLAB interface by extensive simulations
   on real time solar energy profiles in terms of magnitude and stability
   of sensors average duty cycle. The proposed algorithm achieves an
   average duty cycle of 65\% to 69\% with a limit of 70\% maximum duty
   cycle irrespective of irregular radiation patterns throughout the day as
   well as for different forecasting horizons. The results shows minimum
   variation in estimated and real time energy profiles in stable weather
   conditions and optimize the duty cycle in irregular weather conditions.
   The results also shows minimum variation (>2\%) in estimated and real
   time energy profiles in stable weather conditions and optimize the duty
   cycle in irregular weather conditions.},

Title = {Perceptions and experiences of nursing students enrolled in a palliative
   and end-of-life nursing elective: A qualitative study},

Abstract = {Background: The Carnegie Foundation has identified three professional
   apprenticeships in nursing that are key to helping students acquire a
   professional identity. These apprenticeships integrate knowledge
   acquisition (cognitive apprenticeship), practical experience (practical
   apprenticeship), and an ethical identity (ethical comportment) for
   guiding conduct. To ensure that patients have a good death, it is
   important that faculty incorporate diverse teaching strategies from all
   three apprenticeships into palliative and end-of life nursing education.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine perceptions and
   experiences of nursing students enrolled in a palliative and end-of-life
   nursing elective that was developed and implemented using the three
   professional apprenticeships.
   Design: A qualitative research design was used to obtain data from
   students who completed the palliative and end-of-life nursing elective.
   Setting: The study was implemented at a state supported baccalaureate
   nursing program located in the south eastern United States.
   Participants: A purposive sample of 19 students who had completed the
   palliative and end-of-life nursing elective was included in the study.
   Methods: After completing the course, focus groups were conducted with
   the student participants. Discussion was guided by questions to elicit
   which experiences were most helpful to student learning. Thematic
   analysis of the data was conducted by three researchers.
   Findings: Three themes reflecting the apprenticeships were identified:
   learning from stories, learning from being there, and learning from
   caring. Students' understandings about end-of-life care were enhanced by
   incorporating teaching strategies addressing the apprenticeships.
   Conclusion: In end-of-life nursing education, teaching strategies must
   provide meaningful connections between the student, course content,
   practical experience, and the dying patient. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   in determining the effectiveness and appropriateness of incorporating
   intercultural communication in nursing curricula.
   Objective: This study explored the perceptions of undergraduate nursing
   students regarding intercultural communication in their nursing program.
   Design: This study used a qualitative descriptive design guided by the
   Integrated Model of Intercultural Communication Competence.
   Setting: A Western Canadian university.
   Participants: Ten fourth-year undergraduate nursing students.
   Methods: Participants volunteered to participate in a semi-structured,
   one-on-one interview. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed
   verbatim, and analyzed using content analysis. Another data source was
   the first author's reflective journal. Member checks were conducted.
   Results: Participants perceived that limited intercultural communication
   content existed in nursing curricula; however, they acknowledged that
   learning about and engaging in intercultural communication facilitated
   more empathetic and culturally safe nursing practice. Barriers
   identified during intercultural communication in students' clinical
   practice included language, power differentials, gender, and limited
   staffing. However, students' cultural background, experiences, social
   media, and learning within culturally diverse environments were
   perceived to enable them to facilitate intercultural communication.
   Based on the findings, recommendations were formulated to integrate a
   cultural component in health assessment protocols with the addition of
   active teaching strategies to equip nursing students with the requisite
   skills and knowledge for effective intercultural communication.
   Conclusion: This study highlighted the perceived barriers, facilitators,
   and outcomes of intercultural communication education. Participating
   nursing students described how they developed empathetic intercultural
   communication skills and adjusted care with culturally diverse clients.
   Findings indicate that nurse educators use active teaching strategies
   that offer students opportunities to engage with culturally diverse
   clients.},

Abstract = {We study the distributed detection problem in a balanced binary relay
   tree, where the leaves of the tree are sensors generating binary
   messages. The root of the tree is a fusion center that makes an overall
   decision. Every other node in the tree is a relay node that fuses binary
   messages from its two child nodes into a new binary message and sends it
   to the parent node at the next level. We assume that the relay nodes at
   the same level use identical fusion rule. The goal is to find a string
   of fusion rules used at all the levels in the tree that maximizes the
   reduction in the total error probability between the leaf nodes and the
   fusion center. We formulate this problem as a deterministic dynamic
   program and express the optimal strategy in terms of Bellman's equation.
   Moreover, we use the notion of string-submodularity to show that the
   reduction in the total error probability is a string-submodular
   function. Consequentially, we show that the greedy strategy, which only
   maximizes the level-wise reduction in the total error probability,
   performs at least within a factor (1-1/e) of the optimal strategy in
   terms of reduction in the total error probability, even if the nodes and
   links in the trees are subject to random failures.},

Title = {Inter-professional in-situ simulated team and resuscitation training for
   patient safety: Description and impact of a programmatic approach},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Month = {OCT 29},
Abstract = {Background: Inter-professional teamwork is key for patient safety and
   team training is an effective strategy to improve patient outcome.
   In-situ simulation is a relatively new strategy with emerging efficacy,
   but best practices for the design, delivery and implementation have yet
   to be evaluated. Our aim is to describe and evaluate the implementation
   of an inter-professional in-situ simulated team and resuscitation
   training in a teaching hospital with a programmatic approach.
   Methods: We designed and implemented a team and resuscitation training
   program according to Kern's six steps approach for curriculum
   development. General and specific needs assessments were conducted as
   independent cross-sectional surveys. Teamwork, technical skills and
   detection of latent safety threats were defined as specific objectives.
   Inter-professional in-situ simulation was used as educational strategy.
   The training was embedded within the workdays of participants and
   implemented in our highest acuity wards (emergency department, intensive
   care unit, intermediate care unit). Self-perceived impact and
   self-efficacy were sampled with an anonymous evaluation questionnaire
   after every simulated training session. Assessment of team performance
   was done with the team-based self-assessment tool TeamMonitor applying
   Van der Vleuten's conceptual framework of longitudinal evaluation after
   experienced real events. Latent safety threats were reported during
   training sessions and after experienced real events.
   Results: The general and specific needs assessments clearly identified
   the problems, revealed specific training needs and assisted with
   stakeholder engagement. Ninety-five interdisciplinary staff members of
   the Children's Hospital participated in 20 in-situ simulated training
   sessions within 2 years. Participant feedback showed a high effect and
   acceptance of training with reference to self-perceived impact and
   self-efficacy. Thirty-five team members experiencing 8 real critical
   events assessed team performance with TeamMonitor. Team performance
   assessment with TeamMonitor was feasible and identified specific areas
   to target future team training sessions. Training sessions as well as
   experienced real events revealed important latent safety threats that
   directed system changes.
   Conclusions: The programmatic approach of Kern's six steps for
   curriculum development helped to overcome barriers of design,
   implementation and assessment of an in-situ team and resuscitation
   training program. This approach may help improve effectiveness and
   impact of an in-situ simulated training program.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUNDFood co-op models have gained popularity as a mechanism for
   offering affordable, quality produce. We describe the challenges,
   successes, and lessons learned from implementation of a school-based
   program using a food co-op model combined with nutrition education to
   improve access to and intake of fresh fruits and vegetables among
   low-income children and their families.
   METHODSBrighter Bites is a 16-week intervention comprising of fresh
   produce deliveries, recipe demonstrations, and nutrition education. A
   mixed-methods approach was used comprising survey and focus group data
   collected from Brighter Bites staff, parents, and teachers. Descriptive
   statistics and frequencies were computed for the survey data collected.
   RESULTSBrighter Bites was implemented across 9 schools, serving a total
   of 1530 predominantly low-income families in the 2013-2014 school year.
   Brighter Bites distributed an average 60.2 servings of fresh fruits and
   vegetables per family per week. Lessons learned included the importance
   of leveraging existing infrastructure of food banks and schools to
   implement the program, early school and parent engagement, and
   incorporating strategies to track and optimize engagement.
   CONCLUSIONSClear expectations and reliable partnerships are keys to the
   delivery of the Brighter Bites program.},

Title = {Medical Hematology/Oncology Fellows' Perceptions of Online Medical

Abstract = {In response to the COVID-19 social distancing guidelines, residency and
   fellowship programs transitioned to virtual instruction to deliver
   didactics and continue with medical education. The efficacy of such a
   fully online learning environment, however, remains unknown. To
   investigate its impact on medical education, this study surveyed
   hematology/oncology fellows at The University of Texas MD Anderson
   Cancer Center on their attitudes regarding the online-based lecture
   program. Fellows were emailed a 19-question survey with questions on
   demographics, ease of technical access to the online platform, level of
   comfort with participation, knowledge acquisition, wellness, and
   COVID-19-specific coverage. A free-text question soliciting ways to
   improve upon online learning was also included. The response rate was
   71\% (30/42). Most respondents reported easy/very easy accessibility to
   the online environment. Seventy-seven percent of the participants did
   not experience a technical issue. Seventy percent felt comfortable/very
   comfortable with participating in the conference. Thirty-seven percent
   felt comfortable/very comfortable with actively offering an answer to
   questions during the interactive board review session. Eighty-seven
   percent would have been more willing to offer an answer during the board
   review session if an anonymous poll format was utilized. Sixty-three
   percent felt they learned the same amount as they typically do during an
   in-person session. Thirty-three percent reported they were less focused
   as compared with an in-person session. One hundred percent of the
   participants had their questions answered, either at all times (87\%) or
   sometimes (13\%). Sixty percent experienced a change in social
   interactions as compared with an in-person session. Fifty-four percent
   reported that it was easy/very to balance online attendance despite
   personal/family commitments. One hundred percent appreciated the
   flexibility of the online learning environment. Ninety percent felt
   safer at home attending these lectures compared with receiving these
   lectures in-person during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, most fellows
   felt comfortable with the transition to a fully online learning
   environment. Strategies to encourage active participation, enhance
   social interaction, and provide additional flexibility are still needed.},

Title = {Does building resilience in undergraduate nursing students happen
   through clinical placements? A qualitative study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},
Pages = {1-5},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: The shortage of nurses has become a global phenomenon, and
   methods of decreasing the attrition rate of nurses have been explored.
   Resilience was one of the important factors that increased the retention
   rate of nurses who stayed in this highly stressful profession.
   Objectives: To understand how undergraduate nursing students perceive
   and experience their clinical placements and to identify the factors
   that helped them build resilience. Design: A qualitative design
   utilizing focus group interviews was adopted for this study.
   Participants: Nineteen third- and fourth-year undergraduate nursing
   students in a Bachelor of Nursing program participated in this study.
   Setting This study was conducted at a local university in Singapore.
   Method: Four audio-taped focus group interviews were conducted.
   Results: Students reported that they were stressed while facing
   challenges head-on during their first clinical placements, mainly due to
   a lack of peer and clinical support. Gradually, students built
   resilience overtime and were able to adapt to the ward culture through
   peer support and reframing coping strategies.
   Conclusion: Nursing students gradually built resilience after
   accumulating experiences from their clinical placements. Although they
   eventually adapted well, peer, clinical, and informational support
   during clinical placements were lacking. Resilience programs that teach
   positive coping strategies and mindfulness training could be implemented
   in the undergraduate nursing curriculum.},

Title = {Science identity and metacognitive development in undergraduate
   mentor-teachers},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},

Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {Background A growing part of the efforts to promote student engagement
   and success in undergraduate STEM are the family of Student Support and
   Outreach Programs (SSOPs), which task undergraduate students with
   providing support and mentoring to their peers and near-peers. Research
   has shown that these programs can provide a variety of benefits for the
   programs' recipients, including increased academic achievement,
   satisfaction, retention, and entry into STEM careers. This paper extends
   this line of inquiry to investigate how participation in these programs
   impacts the undergraduate STEM students that provide the mentoring
   (defined here as undergraduate mentor-teachers or UMTs). We use activity
   theory to explore the nature of metacognition and identity development
   in UMTs engaged in two programs at a public urban-serving university in
   the western USA: a STEM Learning Assistant program and a program to
   organize middle and high school STEM clubs. Constructs of metacognition
   and identity development are seen as critical outcomes of experiential
   STEM inreach and outreach programs. Results Written reflections were
   collected throughout implementation of two experiential STEM inreach and
   outreach programs. A thematic analysis of the reflections revealed UMTs
   using metacognitive strategies includingcontent reflection and
   reinforcementandgoal settingfor themselves and the students they were
   supporting. Participants also showed metacognitive awareness of
   thebarriers and challengesrelated to their role in the program. In
   addition to these metacognitive processes, the UMTs developed their
   science identities by attaching different meanings to theirrole as a
   mentorin their respective programs and settingperformance
   expectationsfor their roles. Performance expectations were contingent on
   pedagogical skills and the amount and type of content knowledge needed
   to effectively address student needs. The ability to meet students'
   needs served tovalidateand verify UMTs' role in the program, and
   ultimately their own science identities. Conclusion Findings from this
   study suggest that metacognitive and identity developments are outcomes
   shaped not only by undergraduate students' experiences, but also by
   their perceptions of what it means to learn and teach STEM. Experiential
   STEM inreach and outreach programs with structured opportunities for
   guided and open reflections can contribute to building participants'
   metacognition and enhancing their science identities.},

   Crowd-Sensing Using a Decomposition Technique and Deep Q-Learning},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {95808-95822},
Abstract = {Mobile crowd-sensing (MCS) is a data collection paradigm, which recruits
   mobile users with smart devices to perform sensing tasks on a city-wide
   scale. In MCS, a key challenge is task allocation, especially when MCS
   applications are time-sensitive, and the platform needs to consider task
   completion order (since a worker may perform multiple tasks and
   different task completion orders lead to different travel costs and
   response times, i.e., the times needed to arrive at the task venues),
   requirements of tasks (such as deadline and required sensor) and workers
   heterogeneity. In other words, the task allocation problem consists of
   multiple task completion order problems, which is challenging to solve
   due to the large solution space. Therefore, in this paper, we first
   formulate the considered problem into two related integer linear
   programming problems (i.e., assignment and task completion order
   problems) using a decomposition technique in order to reduce the problem
   size and enable the use of diverse searching strategies. Then, a deep
   Q-learning (DQN)-based algorithm, namely assignment DQN with a local
   search (A-DQN w/ LS), is proposed to determine the task-worker
   assignments, which iteratively employs an asymmetric traveling salesman
   (ATSP) heuristic to find the task completion orders of the workers. The
   local optimizer is applied at the end of the A-DQN algorithm to deal
   with the computation time and local optima. Simulation results show that
   the proposed method outperforms existing approaches under different
   sensing dynamics in terms of total cost.},

Title = {Need Fulfillment and Resilience Mediate the Relationship between
   Mindfulness and Coping in Medical Students},
Journal = {TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {34},

Abstract = {Theory: Medical programs have turned to mindfulness-based initiatives to
   help reduce student distress and promote healthy coping within the
   learning environment. However, little attention has been paid to how
   fulfillment of medical students' basic psychological needs (autonomy,
   competence, and relatedness) impacts their capacity to be mindful and
   cope with stress. Self-Determination Theory (SDT) posits that
   mindfulness facilitates adaptive coping and wellness, in large part
   because of need fulfillment. Hypotheses: Using SDT as a lens, it is
   hypothesized that medical students' resilience and, to a greater extent,
   need fulfillment in medical school, will mediate the relationship
   between their mindfulness and coping reactions to stress. Method:
   One-hundred-ninety-seven medical students from the University of
   Saskatchewan were recruited to participate in this study: 71 first year,
   58 second year, and 36 third and fourth year, each. Students completed
   an anonymous survey, measuring need fulfillment in medical school,
   mindfulness, resilience, and frequent use of various adaptive and
   maladaptive coping strategies. We assessed the extent that need
   fulfillment and resilience mediated the relationship between mindfulness
   and coping styles. Results: Need satisfaction and resilience fully
   mediated the relationship between mindfulness and adaptive coping.
   Conversely, need frustration and resilience partially mediated the
   relationship between mindfulness and maladaptive coping. Need
   fulfillment was a stronger mediator than resilience in both coping
   models. Conclusions: Findings suggest that increased supports for
   medical students' resilience and basic psychological needs may promote
   their mindfulness, and in turn, their ability to respond more adaptively
   and less maladaptively to stressors they face in medical school.},

Title = {The Role of the Nonphysician Educator in General Surgery Residency
   Training: From Outcome Project and Duty-Hours Restrictions to the Next
   Accreditation System and Milestones},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In 2002 and 2003 the ACGME Outcome Project (assessing
   residents based on competencies) and duty-hours restrictions were
   implemented. One strategy for assisting PDs in the increased workload
   was to hire nonphysician educators with training and experience in
   curriculum design, teaching techniques, adult learning theories, and
   research methods. This study sought to document prevalence and
   responsibilities of nonphysician educators.
   METHODS: IRB approval was received for a two-part study. All 247 general
   surgery PDs were e-mailed the question, ``Do you have a nonphysician
   educator as a member of your surgery education office?{''} Those who
   replied ``yes{''} or volunteered ``not currently but in the past{''}
   were e-mailed a link to an electronic survey concerning the role of the
   nonphysician educator.
   SETTING: Residency training programs in general surgery.
   PARTICIPANTS: General surgery program directors.
   RESULTS: Of the 126 PDs who responded to the initial query, 37 said
   ``yes{''} and 4 replied ``not currently but in the past{''}. Thirty-two
   PDs of the initial 41 respondents completed the survey. Significant
   findings included: 65\% were hired in the last 6 years; faculty rank is
   held by 69\%; and curriculum development was the most common
   responsibility but teaching, research, and administrative duties were
   often listed. PDs perceived that faculty, residents, and medical
   students had mostly positive attitudes towards nonphysician educators.
   CONCLUSIONS: The overall results seem to support the notion that
   nonphysician educators serve as vital members of the team. (C) 2014

Title = {Building cyber security awareness in a developing country: Lessons from
   Myanmar},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {97},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The paper discusses the arguments for inclusion of cybersecurity
   awareness building in development assistance programs. We note that
   cybersecurity awareness building can strengthen the resilience of
   productivity-enhancing services, such as mobile banking and e-payment
   systems, and benefit economic growth. We develop a typology of
   cybersecurity strategies involving government, the private sector and
   the international community. The paper describes an Australian-funded
   program delivered by Monash University to overcome cyber errorism by
   strengthening cybersecurity capacity and awareness in Myanmar and
   explains how and why it was delivered. Drawing on the program's
   experience, the paper identifies various challenges to managing an
   effective program as well as eight lessons learned which might be
   applicable to other programs. Key amongst the lessons learned is the
   need for a solid understanding of how the internet is accessed and used
   in the host country, and the need for local content to attract target
   audience attention. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Evaluation of Internet Addiction Exercise Intervention Effect for
   Teenagers Based on Intelligent Psychological Strategy Technology},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {SEP 14},
Abstract = {Modern information has led to Internet addiction among some young
   people. Some studies have shown that Internet addiction has serious harm
   to young people, such as affecting young people's learning and
   endangering young people's physical health. Even more serious, it may
   lead to depression, suicide, and other problem appearance. At present,
   most of the research on Internet addiction focuses on the development of
   questionnaires, symptoms, and causes of Internet addiction, and there is
   still a lack of treatment and intervention. Therefore, in the era of
   rapid development of artificial intelligence, let artificial
   intelligence use psychological strategies. Technology to intervene
   adolescents' Internet addiction is a new technology required by current
   intelligent psychological terminal equipment, and this technology is
   still in the field of data preprocessing and classification. For the
   intelligent psychological strategy technology that is applied and
   located in the terminal device, the ability to intelligently identify
   whether the Internet addiction is an inevitable trend of the development
   of modern intelligent devices. Looking back at this technology, we can
   often see two prominent problems with this technology during the
   development process, namely, accuracy and efficiency. Due to the
   development of 5G technology and cloud computing, the intelligent
   identification process can be transferred to the cloud for rapid
   completion, and the terminal device only needs to receive feedback to
   solve the efficiency problem as much as possible. The problem of
   relative accuracy is the difficulty that the current intelligent
   psychological strategy technology needs to overcome, and it is also the
   focus of this article. This paper introduces the related technologies in
   the process of intelligent psychological technology intervention, the
   extraction of Internet addiction problems, and the use of related
   technologies to intervene and explore the improvement under the current
   mainstream algorithm conditions. Intelligent technology improves the
   accuracy of psychological intervention. Through the discussion of the
   actual comparison experiment of the algorithm, we can understand that
   the influencing factors of the accuracy rate are mainly concentrated in
   the influence of the Internet, such as unreasonable game play and video
   browsing. We are committed to ensuring that the intelligent
   psychological strategy technology of terminal equipment can accurately
   intervene the Internet addiction problem of young people without
   changing the equipment conditions. First of all, the optimized algorithm
   is easier to understand and less difficult to use than ordinary
   algorithms, which greatly reduces the difficulty for psychoanalysts or
   intervention evaluators to deal with problems. Secondly, the intelligent
   psychological strategy technology is the product of many experiments and
   is gradually widely recognized and accepted by everyone. It can carry
   out statistics, calculation, and visual display through various data of

Abstract = {The Next Generation Science Standards in the United States placed a
   special emphasis on engineering unlike previous national science
   education policy documents. Some studies attempted to examine students'
   and teachers' nature of engineering (NOE) views, but NOE views should be
   better conceptualized before further exploration of students' and
   teachers' NOE views. This study sought to assess the influence of
   solving an engineering design problem on elementary teachers' nature of
   engineering (NOE) views. We examined changes in NOE views of 30
   elementary teachers from different schools in a large urban school
   district in southwestern United States. An open-ended NOE questionnaire
   coupled with individual interviews was used to collect data about
   participants' NOE views before and after the engineering design
   experience. Elementary teachers participated in a 3-day professional
   development program that engaged them in designing soda can crushers.
   Overall, we found that elementary teachers made substantial gains in
   their NOE views. The result of the present study supports the inclusion
   of more explicit and reflective strategies to teach NOE aspects during
   engineering design experiences.},

Abstract = {Introduction: This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Mentoring
   and Professionalism in Training (MAP-IT) program, a longitudinal,
   interprofessional faculty development curriculum designed to enhance
   clinicians' humanistic mentoring skills, specifically nurses and
   physicians.
   Methods: During 2014 to 2016, two consecutive cohorts of nurses and
   physicians completed the MAP-IT program. Participants included 169 high
   potential mentors (HPMs) and 61 facilitator leaders. Each 10-month
   program consisted of small group work, experiential learning, and
   critical reflection aimed at enhancing humanistic mentoring skills.
   Throughout the program, facilitator leaders served as mentors for the
   HPMs. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected to measure
   changes in skill levels specific to humanistic teaching practices, as
   well as overall evaluation of the program's curriculum and logistics.
   Quantitative data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test,
   descriptive statistics, and Fisher exact test, as appropriate.
   Qualitative data assessing the overall impact and applicability of the
   program to the clinical setting were analyzed using content analysis
   methodology.
   Results: Across cohorts, HPMs demonstrated significant increases in
   perceptions of humanistic teaching skills. During objective structured
   teaching simulations, significant increases were also found in HPMs'
   self-reported mentoring skills and their skills as rated by a
   standardized RN/MD. Qualitative analyses revealed themes of the program
   to be skill development and application, mentorship, humanism,
   mindfulness, self-care, and acknowledgment of overlapping
   interprofessional roles.
   Discussion: Utilizing an interprofessional education approach, the
   MAP-IT program was determined to be a feasible strategy to positively
   impact the personal and professional development of nurses and
   physicians.},

Abstract = {Innovative pedagogies have significantly impacted health professions'
   education, dental education included. In this context, faculty, defined
   in this study as instructor in higher education, has been increasingly
   required to hone their instructional skills. The purpose of this
   exploratory study was to share the design, implementation and
   preliminary outcomes of two programmes to enhance dental faculty's
   instructional skills, the Teaching and Learning Seminar Series and the
   Course Director Orientation. Data sources included faculty and student
   surveys developed and administered by the researchers; data extracted
   from the learning management system; reports from the learning analytics
   tool; and classroom observations. Participants' satisfaction,
   self-reported learning, instructional behavioural change, and impact on
   student learning behaviours and institutional practice were assessed
   borrowing from Kirkpatrick's 4-level model of evaluation of professional
   development effectiveness. Initial findings showed that faculty in both
   programmes reported positive learning experiences. Participants reported
   that the programmes motivated them to improve instructional practice and
   improved their knowledge of instructional innovation. Some faculty
   reported implementation of new instructional strategies and tools, which
   helped create an active and interactive learning environment that was
   welcomed by their students. The study contributes to literature and best
   practice in health sciences faculty development in pedagogy and may
   guide other dental schools in designing professional development
   programmes.},

Title = {Instilling New Ways of Understanding the Innovation Process:
   Evidence-Based Heuristics from Student Innovation Experiences},

Abstract = {In the workplace, engineers face complex technological landscapes,
   critical and nuanced user needs and societal problems, and intense
   rivalry from competitors. To address these challenges, engineering
   programs have increasingly emphasized knowledge, skills, and mindsets
   related to innovation. Yet, innovation is a complex phenomenon (spanning
   diverse processes and environments), which can make it challenging to
   provide these opportunities and frame them within appropriate learning
   contexts. Recently, researchers have explored course design heuristics
   to bring expert reasoning, creativity, and efficiency to course design
   tasks. This study seeks to develop course design heuristics for
   innovation education by building upon two previous studies. In the first
   study, phenomenography supported the identification of distinct and
   hierarchically-varied ways of experiencing innovation among engineering
   students. In the second study, critical incident technique and thematic
   analysis led to identification of experiences that supported more
   comprehensive ways of experiencing innovation. In the current study, we
   reverse engineer heuristics by investigating instructional approaches
   that facilitated the critical incidents and how they supported new ways
   of experiencing innovation. Thirty-one undergraduate engineering
   students from 13 different engineering majors and over 40 distinct
   innovative design experiences participated in this study. Through a
   collaborative, inductive content analysis process, we identified 55
   strategies (or what we refer to as Innovation Heuristics) evident in the
   critical incidents (e.g., features of instruction, the learning
   environment). These strategies were categorized into seven themes: (1)
   contextualize; (2) situate; (3) guide; (4) support; (5) challenge; (6)
   motivate; and (7) extend. The paper describes and details each theme and
   the associated Innovation Heuristics that supported innovation learning,
   including key examples from the data and how they may be used by
   instructors.},

Abstract = {Problem Gun violence results in approximately 40,000 deaths in the
   United States each year, yet physicians rarely discuss gun access and
   firearm safety with patients. Lack of education about how to have these
   conversations is an important barrier, particularly among trainees.
   Approach A 2-part training curriculum was developed for first-year
   residents. It included (1) a didactic presentation outlining a framework
   to understand types of firearm-related violence, describing
   institutional resources, and reviewing strategies for approaching
   discussions about firearms with patients, and (2) interactive case
   scenarios, adjusted for clinical disciplines, with standardized
   patients. Before and after the training, participants completed surveys
   on the training's relevance, efficacy, and benefit. Standardized
   patients provided real-time feedback to participants and completed
   assessments based on prespecified learning objectives. Outcomes In
   June-August 2019, 148 first-year residents in internal medicine (n =
   74), general surgery (n = 12), emergency medicine (n = 15), pediatrics
   (n = 22), psychiatry (n = 16), and OB/GYN (n = 9) completed the
   training. Most (70\%, n = 104) reported having no prior exposure to gun
   violence prevention education. Knowledge about available resources
   increased among participants from 3\% (n = 5) pretraining to 97\% (n =
   143) post-training. Awareness about relevant laws, such as Extreme Risk
   Protection Orders, and their appropriate use increased from 3\% (n = 4)
   pretraining to 98\% (n = 145) post-training. Comfort discussing access
   to guns and gun safety with patients increased from a median of 5
   pretraining to 8 post-training (on a scale of 1-10, with higher scores
   indicating more comfort). Next Steps Delivery of a case-based gun
   violence prevention training program was effective and feasible in a
   single institution. Next steps include expanding the training to other
   learners (across undergraduate and graduate medical education) and
   institutions and assessing how the program changes practice over time.},

Title = {The development and implementation of a 12-month simulation-based

   debriefing with good judgment and rapid cycle deliberate practice},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {BackgroundThere are currently training gaps, primarily procedural and
   teamwork skills, for pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) fellows.
   Simulation-based learning (SBL) has been suggested as an educational
   modality to help fill those gaps. However, there is little evidence
   suggesting how to do so. The objective of this project is to develop and
   implement an SBL curriculum for PEM fellows with established curriculum
   development processes and instructional design strategies to improve PEM
   fellowship training.MethodsWe developed a 12-month longitudinal SBL
   curriculum focused on needs assessment, instructional strategies, and
   evaluation. The curriculum development process led us to combine the
   instructional strategies of debriefing with good judgment, rapid cycle
   deliberate practice, and task-training to improve core PEM skills such
   as procedural competence, crisis resource management, and managing
   complex medical and traumatic emergencies. Using multiple approaches, we
   measured outcomes related to learners (attendance, performance, critical
   procedure opportunities), instructor performance, and program
   structure.ResultsEight/Eight (100\%) PEM fellows participated in this
   curriculum from July 2015 to June 2017 with an overall attendance rate
   of 68\%. Learners self-reported high satisfaction (4.4/5, SD=0.5) and
   perceived educational value (4.9/5, SD=0.38) with the curriculum and
   overall program structure. Learners had numerous opportunities to
   practice critical procedures such as airway management (20
   opportunities), defibrillator use (ten opportunities), and others (ten
   opportunities). Learner Debriefing Assessment for Simulation in
   Healthcare (short version) scores had mean scores greater than 5.8/7
   (SD=0.89) across all six elements.ConclusionsThis longitudinal SBL
   curriculum combining debriefing with good judgment and rapid cycle
   deliberate practice can be a feasible method of reducing current
   training gaps (specifically with critical procedure opportunities) in
   PEM fellowship training. More work is needed to quantify the training
   gap reduction and to refine the curriculum.},

Title = {Designing for sustained adoption: A model of developing educational
   innovations for successful propagation},

Abstract = {{[}This paper is part of the Focused Collection on Preparing and
   Supporting University Physics Educators.] The physics education research
   community has produced a wealth of knowledge about effective teaching
   and learning of college level physics. Based on this knowledge, many
   research-proven instructional strategies and teaching materials have
   been developed and are currently available to instructors.
   Unfortunately, these intensive research and development activities have
   failed to influence the teaching practices of many physics instructors.
   This paper describes interim results of a larger study to develop a
   model of designing materials for successful propagation. The larger
   study includes three phases, the first two of which are reported here.
   The goal of the first phase was to characterize typical propagation
   practices of education developers, using data from a survey of 1284
   National Science Foundation (NSF) principal investigators and focus
   group data from eight disciplinary groups of NSF program directors. The
   goal of the second phase was to develop an understanding of successful
   practice by studying three instructional strategies that have been well
   propagated. The result of the first two phases is a tentative model of
   designing for successful propagation, which will be further validated in
   the third phase through purposeful sampling of additional
   well-propagated instructional strategies along with typical education
   development projects. We found that interaction with potential adopters
   was one of the key missing ingredients in typical education development
   activities. Education developers often develop a polished product before
   getting feedback, rely on mass-market communication channels for
   dissemination, and do not plan for supporting adopters during
   implementation. The tentative model resulting from this study identifies
   three key propagation activities: interactive development, interactive
   dissemination, and support of adopters. Interactive development uses
   significant feedback from potential adopters to develop a strong product
   suitable for use in many settings. Interactive dissemination uses
   personal interactions to reach and motivate potential users. Support of
   adopters is missing from typical propagation practice and is important
   to reduce the burden of implementation and increases the likelihood of
   successful adoption.},

   Teachers in Giving Feedback to Early Learners},

Abstract = {Background
   Medical students learn clinical skills at the bedside from teaching
   clinicians, who often learn to teach by teaching. Little is known about
   the process of becoming an effective clinical teacher. Understanding how
   teaching skills and approaches change with experience may help tailor
   faculty development for new teachers. Focusing on giving feedback to
   early learners, the authors asked: What is the developmental progression
   of clinician-teachers as they learn to give clinical skills feedback to
   medical students?
   Method
   This qualitative study included longitudinal interviews with
   clinician-teachers over five years in a new clinical skills teaching
   program for preclinical medical students. Techniques derived from
   grounded theory were used for initial analyses. The current study
   focused on one theme identified in initial analyses: giving feedback to
   students. Transcript passages were organized by interview year, coded,
   and discussed in year clusters; thematic codes were compared and
   emergent codes developed.
   Results
   Themes related to giving feedback demonstrated a dyadic structure:
   characteristic of less experienced teachers versus characteristic of
   experienced teachers. Seven dominant dyadic themes emerged, including
   teacher as cheerleader versus coach, concern about student fragility
   versus understanding resilience, and focus on creating a safe
   environment versus challenging students within a safe environment.
   Conclusions
   With consistent teaching, clinical teachers demonstrated progress in
   giving feedback to students in multiple areas, including understanding
   students' developmental trajectory and needs, developing tools and
   strategies, and adopting a dynamic, challenging, inclusive team
   approach. Ongoing teaching opportunities with targeted faculty
   development may help improve clinician-teachers' feedback skills and
   approaches.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a new Web portal offering experimental labs for
   ubiquitous training of university engineering students in work-related
   risk prevention. The Web-accessible computer program simulates the noise
   and machine vibrations met in the work environment, in a series of
   virtual laboratories that mimic an actual laboratory and provide the
   corresponding calculations and plots. The main goal of this work is to
   provide new learning strategies and methodologies to motivate students
   and challenge them to learn risk prevention strategies for the
   workplace. Students can perform the virtual experiments before taking
   their actual laboratory classes and repeat them whenever and as often as
   they want. Evaluation results show the system was considered very
   satisfactory, with an average student rating of 8.95 out of a maximum of
   10. As well as being used for educational purposes, the program can be
   used in industry as a decision tool for factory workers and technicians.},

Title = {Pre-licensure nursing students' experiences of psychological safety: A
   qualitative descriptive study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {105},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Organizational learning is essential for consistently
   providing safe, efficient, high-quality patient care. Psychological
   safety is foundational for organizational learning. For pre-licensure
   nursing students psychological safety is crucial for both their learning
   and patient safety. Understanding pre-licensure nursing students'
   experiences of psychological safety can guide efforts to cultivate
   clinical environments conducive to learning and excellent patient care.
   Objectives: The objective of this study was to gain insight into
   pre-licensure nursing students' first-hand experiences with
   psychological safety in clinical settings. Design: A qualitative,
   descriptive design was used for this study. Settings: Participants were
   recruited from 12 different nursing programs across eight states.
   Participants: A total of 26 pre-licensure nursing students participated
   in this study. Included were students who had completed at least one
   clinical rotation, but had not yet obtained licensure as a registered
   nurse. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted via telephone.
   Interviews were analyzed using a constant comparative approach to
   thematic analysis. Results: Four primary themes emerged from the data,
   two of which had sub-themes: 1) Feeling Self-Conscious, with the
   sub-themes Expecting Expectations and Interpreting Feedback; 2)
   Engaging; 3) Learning and Performing; and 4) Moving Forward, with the
   sub-themes Using Coping Strategies and Developing Confidence.
   Conclusions: This study reinforces the importance of psychological
   safety for nursing students' learning and for patient safety. Feeling
   psychologically safe allowed students to engage in the clinical setting,
   to learn from their experiences, and to perform their very best. With
   these insights, faculty and clinical preceptors can cultivate effective
   learning environments where patients can also receive safe, high-quality
   patient care.},

Title = {Development and Use of Domain-specific Learning Theories, Models, and
   Instruments in Computing Education},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTING EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Use of theory within a field of research provides the foundation for
   designing effective research programs and establishing a deeper
   understanding of the results obtained. This, together with the emergence
   of domain specific theory, is often taken as an indicator of the
   maturity of any research area. This article explores the development and
   subsequent usage of domain-specific theories and theoretical constructs
   (TCs) in computing education research (CER). All TCs found in 878 papers
   published in three major CER publication venues over the period
   2005-2020 were identified and assessed to determine the nature and
   purpose of the constructs found. We focused more closely on areas
   related to learning, studying, and progression, where our analysis found
   80 new TCs that had been developed, based on multiple epistemological
   perspectives. Several existing frameworks were used to categorize the
   areas of CER focus in which TCs were found, the methodology by which
   they were developed, and the nature and purpose of the TCs. A citation
   analysis was undertaken, with 1,727 citing papers accessed to determine
   to what extent and in what ways TCs had been used and developed to
   inform subsequent work, also considering whether these aspects vary
   according to different focus areas within computing education. We noted
   which TCs were used most often and least often, and we present several
   brief case studies that demonstrate progressive development of
   domain-specific theory. The exploration provides insights into trends in
   theory development and suggests areas in which further work might be
   called for. Our findings indicate a general interest in the development
   of TCs during the period studied, and we show examples of how different
   approaches to theory development have been used. We present a framework
   suggesting how strategies for developing new TCs in CER might be
   structured and discuss the nature of theory development in relation to
   the field of CER.},

Abstract = {As an emerging service architecture, microservice enables decomposition
   of a monolithic web service into a set of independent lightweight
   services which can be executed independently. With mobile edge
   computing, microservices can be further deployed in edge clouds
   dynamically, launched quickly, and migrated across edge clouds easily,
   providing better services for users in proximity. However, the user
   mobility can result in frequent switch of nearby edge clouds, which
   increases the service delay when users move away from their serving edge
   clouds. To address this issue, this article investigates microservice
   coordination among edge clouds to enable seamless and real-time
   responses to service requests from mobile users. The objective of this
   work is to devise the optimal microservice coordination scheme which can
   reduce the overall service delay with low costs. To this end, we first
   propose a dynamic programming-based offline microservice coordination
   algorithm, that can achieve the globally optimal performance. However,
   the offline algorithm heavily relies on the availability of the prior
   information such as computation request arrivals, time-varying channel
   conditions and edge cloud's computation capabilities required, which is
   hard to be obtained. Therefore, we reformulate the microservice
   coordination problem using Markov decision process framework and then
   propose a reinforcement learning-based online microservice coordination
   algorithm to learn the optimal strategy. Theoretical analysis proves
   that the offline algorithm can find the optimal solution while the
   online algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance. Furthermore,
   based on two real-world datasets, i.e., the Telecom's base station
   dataset and Taxi Track dataset from Shanghai, experiments are conducted.
   The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed online algorithm
   outperforms existing algorithms in terms of service delay and migration
   costs, and the achieved performance is close to the optimal performance
   obtained by the offline algorithm.},

Title = {Experience with Using BBC Micro:Bit and Perceived Professional Efficacy
   of Informatics Teachers},

Abstract = {Our study is focused on the perceived professional efficacy of
   informatics in-service teachers with the experience of using
   micro-controller BBC micro:bit. In Slovakia, teaching using hardware is
   not typical. In addition, many teachers do not teach programming. BBC
   micro:bit is designed to be a tool for computer science (CS) teachers
   that should make a significant contribution to the innovation of CS
   teaching and enable CS teachers to implement CS lessons. The following
   research questions were asked. Q1: Is there a difference in the
   perceived efficacy to use teaching strategies based on experience with
   the micro:bit? Q2: Is there a relationship between the perceived
   efficacy of using teaching strategies and experience using the
   micro:bit? The research sample comprised N = 388 CS teachers employed in
   Slovak schools from the available selection. The research sample
   included CS teachers who participated in the project called ENTER. All
   participants have a grant, weekly online practices, supporting
   materials, and also consultant for implementation of a new teaching
   strategy. This study's findings indicate that the use of a
   microcontroller such as the micro:bit has a positive impact on
   self-efficacy for instructional strategies, but not for classroom
   management.},

Title = {Toward Edge-Assisted Video Content Intelligent Caching With Long
   Short-Term Memory Learning},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {152832-152846},
Abstract = {Nowadays video content has contributed to the majority of Internet
   traffic, which brings great challenge to the network infrastructure.
   Fortunately, the emergence of edge computing has provided a promising
   way to reduce the video load on the network by caching contents closer
   to users.But caching replacement algorithm is essential for the cache
   efficiency considering the limited cache space under existing
   edge-assisted network architecture. To investigate the challenges and
   opportunities inside, we first measure the performance of five
   state-of-the-art caching algorithms based on three real-world datasets.
   Our observation shows that state-of-the-art caching replacement
   algorithms suffer from following weaknesses: 1) the rule-based
   replacement approachs (e.g., LFU,LRU) cannot adapt under different
   scenarios; 2) data-driven forecast approaches only work efficiently on
   specific scenarios or datasets, as the extracted features working on one
   dataset may not work on another one. Motivated by these observations and
   edge-assisted computation capacity, we then propose an edge-assisted
   intelligent caching replacement framework <italic>LSTM-C</italic> based
   on deep Long Short-Term Memory network, which contains two types of
   modules: 1) four basic modules manage the coordination among content
   requests, content replace, cache space, service management; 2) three
   learning-based modules enable the online deep learning to provide
   intelligent caching strategy. Supported by this design, LSTM-C learns
   the pattern of content popularity at long and short time scales as well
   as determines the cache replacement policy. Most important, LSTM-C
   represents the request pattern with built-in memory cells, thus requires
   no data pre-processing, pre-programmed model or additional information.
   Our experiment results show that LSTM-C outperforms state-of-the-art
   methods in cache hit rate on three real-traces of video requests. When
   the cache size is limited, LSTM-C outperforms baselines by on average
   respectively, which are fast enough for online operations.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE},

Abstract = {Determining the optimal growth stage of leafy vegetables suitable for
   harvesting is of great importance. Despite the availability of many
   intelligent programs designed for plant classification, identifying the
   growth stage of a vegetable from its leaf features remains a major
   challenge. Gynura bicolor DC (G. bicolor) is an important vegetable, and
   its leaves are harvested for culinary use at a specific growth stage.
   The produce quality of leaves is compromised when they are harvested at
   improper stage. A classification model named GL-CNN was proposed based
   on convolutional neural networks to address this issue. The proposed
   model merges the features using a network fusion strategy to expand the
   feature representation on the basis of the intact leaf and leaf patch
   image sets. The networks were validated using a new dataset of G.
   bicolor planted and collected by ourselves. ``Early fusion{''} and
   ``late fusion{''} networks were designed and compared with GL-CNN to
   verify the rationality of network fusion location. The test accuracy of
   GL-CNN reaches 95.63\%, which is the best in the classification task.},

Abstract = {This article reports the results of a curriculum survey of 322
   analytical chemistry instructors (92\% U.S.-based) conducted during
   Spring 2021. This snapshot of current course formats, topics, and
   pedagogical methods will be useful to both seasoned and novice teachers
   of analytical chemistry. The majority of respondents reported that their
   major requires two analytical chemistry courses, and 97\% of respondents
   reported that at least one analytical course is required. Over 80\%
   reported a required analytical lab course. The topic rated most
   important was standardization and calibration methods, followed by
   UV-vis absorbance spectroscopy, data handling, HPLC, GC, statistical
   analysis, general chromatographic theory, sources and types of error,
   mass spectrometry, and add-base theory/ equilibria/buffers. In general,
   topics that were rated as important were likely to be taught in required
   courses and addressed in hands-on laboratories. Over 80\% of instructors
   reported the use of at least one evidence-based active learning
   strategy. In response to open-ended questions, instructors shared their
   strategies for student career preparation, project-based learning, and
   inclusive teaching, with these responses summarized using thematic
   analysis. Responses from 117 instructors give a snapshot of current
   efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion, including
   cultivation of an inclusive environment, implementation of active
   learning, and examples of diverse scientists and culturally relevant
   examples. Respondents also reported the biggest challenge to their
   teaching, which was most frequently associated with obtaining and
   maintaining instrumentation. The results of this survey will help inform
   curricular updates in individual courses and programs and may inspire
   larger community-wide efforts to improve undergraduate analytical
   instruction.},

Title = {Incremental and decremental fuzzy bounded twin support vector machine},
Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {526},
Pages = {20-38},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In this paper, we present an incremental variant of the Twin Support
   Vector Machine (TWSVM) called Fuzzy Bounded Twin Support Vector Machine
   (FBTWSVM) to deal with large datasets and to learn from data streams. We
   combine the TWSVM with a fuzzy membership function, so that each input
   has a different contribution to each hyperplane in a binary classifier.
   To solve the pair of quadratic programming problems (QPPs), we use a
   dual coordinate descent algorithm with a shrinking strategy, and to
   obtain a robust classification with a fast training we propose the use
   of a Fourier Gaussian approximation function with our linear FBTWSVM.
   Inspired by the shrinking technique, the incremental algorithm
   re-utilizes part of the training method with some heuristics, while the
   decremental procedure is based on a scoring window. The FBTWSVM is also
   extended for multi-class problems by combining binary classifiers using
   a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) approach. Moreover, we analyzed the
   theoretical foundation's properties of the proposed approach and its
   extension, and the experimental results on benchmark datasets indicate
   that the FBTWSVM has a fast training and retraining process while
   maintaining a robust classification performance. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

   months apart) with participants of a 3-day Clinical Consultation Skills
   Retreat. Fourteen participants (70\% response, 57\% doctors) took part
   at Time 1, with 12 participating at Time 2. Semi-structured interviews
   were recorded and transcribed, and directional content analysis was
   conducted to assess themes in areas of key learnings, implementation of
   skills, and barriers. The training was received very positively with
   participants valuing the small group learning, role play, and
   facilitator skills. Key learnings were grouped into two themes: (i) tips
   and strategies to use in clinical practice and (ii) communication
   frameworks/methods, with the second theme reflecting an awareness of
   different communication styles. Most participants had tried to implement
   their new skills, with implementation reported as a more deliberate
   activity at T1 than at T2. Those implementing the new skills noted more
   open conversations with patients. Practical barriers of lack of time and
   expectations of others were mentioned more often at T2. A 3-day
   retreat-based communication training program was positively received and
   had a positive impact on the use of new communication skills. While
   further work is needed to determine whether effects of training are
   evidenced in objective clinical behaviors, the positive longer-term
   benefits found suggest this work would be worthwhile.},

Abstract = {The most fundamental task of network representation learning (NRL) is
   nodes classification which requires an algorithm to map nodes to vectors
   and use machine learning models to predict nodes' labels. Recently, many
   methods based on neighborhood aggregation have achieved brilliant
   results in this task. However, the recursive expansion of neighborhood
   aggregation poses scalability and efficiency problems for deep models.
   Existing methods are limited to shallow architectures and cannot capture
   the high order proximity in networks. In this article, we propose the
   deep aggregation network (DAN). DAN uses a layer-wise greedy
   optimization strategy which stacks several sequential trained base
   models to form the final deep model. The high order neighborhood
   aggregation is performed in a dynamic programming manner, which allows
   the recursion nature of neighborhood aggregation to be eliminated. The
   reverse random walk is also proposed, and combined with the classic
   random walk in formulating a novel sampling strategy that allows DAN to
   flexibly adapt to different tasks related to communities or structural
   roles. DAN is more efficient and effective than previous neighborhood
   aggregation based methods, especially when it is intended to handle
   large-scale networks with dense connections. Extensive experiments are
   conducted on both synthetic and real-world networks to empirically
   demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.},

Abstract = {Background: Policies to guide remediation in postgraduate medical
   education exist in all Canadian medical schools. This study examines
   concordance between these policies and processes, and published ``best
   practices{''} in remediation. Method: We conducted a literature review
   to identify best practices in the area of remediation. We then reviewed
   remediation policies from all 13 English medical schools in Canada other
   than our own and conducted interviews with key informants from each
   institution. Each policy and interview transcript pair was then reviewed
   for evidence of pre-defined ``best practices.{''} Team members also
   noted additional potential policy or process enablers of successful
   remediation. Results: Most policies and processes aligned with some but
   not all published best practices. For instance, all participating
   schools tailored remediation strategies to individual resident needs,
   and a majority encouraged faculty-student relationships during
   remediation. Conversely, few required the teaching of goal-setting,
   strategic planning, self-monitoring, and self-awareness. In addition, we
   identified avoidance of automatic training extension and the use of an
   educational review board to support the remediation process as enablers
   for success. Discussion: Remediation policies and practices in Canada
   align well with published best practices in this area. Based on key
   informant opinions, flexibility to avoid training extension and use of
   an educational review board may also support optimal remediation
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {The use of multimodal control techniques for batch dynamic systems
   offers a promising alternative to successfully perform tasks of
   supervision and control in industrial processes. These techniques seek
   to integrate different control strategies with partial objectives or

   operational objectives. These automatons can identify optimal sequences
   of modes, also called control programs, using system simulations.
   Multimodal control programs consist of a sequence of modes, each of
   which comprises a feedback control law (square chi) and relevant
   termination conditions square(chi, T). In this paper the use of a
   reinforcement learning algorithm is described via to find, by
   simulations, optimal control program aligned to maximize productivity in

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A novel approach to trauma team simulation was used to
   enhance team performance in a cohort of general surgical residents. We
   implemented data driven debriefing using performance report cards and
   video footage of the simulations. We wanted to evaluate the technical
   and nontechnical skills developed by teams using this approach.
   DESIGN: All surgical residents in an academic program were divided into
   5 equal ``trauma teams{''}. Throughout the academic year, each team took
   part in 4 standardized, high fidelity trauma simulations. Rubrics to
   assess technical efficiency were scored. Each team received
   individualized feedback in the form of report cards following each
   simulation. Video recordings of each simulation were analyzed by blinded
   raters using a validated instrument to assess nontechnical skills/Crisis
   Resource Management (CRM) skills.
   SETTING: An academic level 1 trauma hospital in Canada.
   RESULTS: Five teams comprising five residents participated in four
   simulations each. Learner feedback was universally positive and learning
   during simulation was rated higher than learning during didactic
   lecture. The effect of data driven report cards and anonymized ranking
   was cited by trainees as a motivating factor to improve. CRM scores
   improved over the course of the academic year for all teams but without
   reaching statistical significance. A strong positive correlation was
   measured between technical and CRM skills for all teams.
   CONCLUSIONS: Adding data driven debriefing using performance report
   cards that assess both technical and CRM skills to a trauma team
   curriculum is a feasible and acceptable way to influence trainee
   performance using positive competitive motivation. More data are
   required to confirm the early patterns of improvement uncovered in CRM
   scoring. A positive correlation between technical skills and CRM skills
   raises important questions for future research. ((C) 2019 Published by

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Active learning techniques result in greater knowledge
   acquisition compared to passive methods. For medical students with
   limited hands-on operative experiences, virtual reality platforms
   represent active learning and may enhance procedural training. We
   hypothesize that virtual reality simulators like Toolkit for
   Illustration of Procedures in Surgery (TIPS) are a more effective
   modality in teaching laparoscopic surgical techniques to medical
   students when compared to passive learning tools like videos.
   DESIGN: In this crossover study, participants were randomly assigned to
   perform either a TIPS laparoscopic appendectomy followed by video of a
   laparoscopic cholecystectomy, or video of a laparoscopic appendectomy
   followed by TIPS laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A knowledge assessment
   followed each intervention. A postsurvey was used to gather feedback and
   subjective impressions of the learning experience.
   SETTING: University of Central Florida College of Medicine.
   PARTICIPANTS: Second, third, and fourth-year medical students (n = 37).
   RESULTS: Validation of the content assessments revealed strong internal
   consistency (Cronbach's a = 0.73). A 2-tailed Fisher's exact test
   revealed that the video had greater ease of use (p = 0.032), but TIPS
   had greater utility as a learning tool (p < 0.001) and instilled greater
   confidence in the ability to reproduce procedural steps (p < 0.001). A
   2-tailed t test of the average content quiz scores revealed no
   significant difference in percentage correct between groups on the
   laparoscopic appendectomy quiz (p = 0.772), but a difference favoring
   video learning on the laparoscopic cholecystectomy quiz (p = 0.042)
   CONCLUSIONS: Video and TIPS both enhanced different aspects of student
   learning; however, the active TIPS platform produced greater confidence
   in the ability to reproduce the steps of the procedure and had greater
   utility as a learning strategy. Videos are simple to use and can serve a
   complementary role in curriculum design. (Published by Elsevier Inc. on

Abstract = {Psychological safety is known to improve team perfor-mance and
   organizational learning. The related concept of ``educational safety ``
   has recently emerged to describe an environment in which learners can
   unreservedly focus on learning and professional growth, without
   wor-rying about the potential repercussions of interpersonal
   risk-taking. Educational safety is crucial for optimal learn-ing in
   clinical environments, and yet is difficult to estab-lish due to
   constant performance assessment, fear of failure, and pervasive
   hierarchies. In this perspective, we propose a framework for
   conceptualizing educa-tional safety in surgical learning environments,
   and explore current threats to educational safety. We also discuss
   strategies for combating these threats, as well as the importance of
   further research to evaluate the impact of educational safety on
   surgical learning out-comes. ( J Surg Ed 79:1083-1087. Published by

Title = {Nursing students' perceptions of combining hands-on simulation with
   simulated patients and a serious game in preparing for clinical
   placement in home healthcare: A qualitative study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {97},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background: There is a growing demand to provide complex healthcare
   services in patients' own homes. However, high quality home healthcare
   clinical placements are often difficult to obtain, and arranging
   laboratory based simulations to provide relevant clinical-practical
   learning experiences for all students is resource intensive.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore nursing students'
   perceptions of using a blended simulation approach, including hands-on
   simulation with simulated patients and a video-based serious game, in
   preparation for their home healthcare clinical placements.
   Design: An exploratory qualitative design using focus group interviews
   was utilized.
   Setting and participants: Secondand third-year nursing students in home
   healthcare courses in Norway participated in this study.
   Methods: Five focus group interviews were conducted with a total of 26
   nursing students. Data were collected over two semesters in three home
   healthcare courses. The data were analyzed using thematic content
   analysis.
   Results: The study identified four main themes that influenced students'
   perceptions of combining the two simulations. These included personal
   engagement, contextual and environmental factors, a safe and structured
   learning environment, as well as organizational and technical factors.
   In relation to the different themes, students expressed that
   disadvantages in one simulation were counteracted in the other.
   Conclusions: The blended simulation approach was perceived to address
   curricular objectives in different but complementary ways. The blended
   simulation approach was perceived to facilitate personal engagement and
   reflections and to provide relevant clinical-practical learning
   experiences. However, results also indicated that the organization of
   such a blended simulation approach (i.e., group compositions and size),
   facilitation from teachers, and technical issues (i.e., with medical
   equipment and the serious game) may influence students' perceptions and
   satisfaction directly. The results should provide useful information for
   designing future teaching strategies in Bachelor of Nursing programs.},

Title = {Best Practices in Establishing and Sustaining Consortia in Pharmacy
   Educationa},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {81},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Objective. To describe best practices, necessary resources, and success
   or lessons learned from established consortia in pharmacy education.
   Methods. Using semi-structured interviews and qualitative analysis,
   interviews with members of established consortia in pharmacy education
   were conducted until saturation was reached. Themes were analyzed and
   meaningful descriptions of consortia characteristics were developed
   using systematic text condensation.
   Results. Thirteen interviews were conducted. The primary purpose for
   forming a consortium was identified as threefold: share ideas/best
   practices; facilitate collaboration; and perform shared problemsolving.
   For experiential education consortia, two additional purposes were
   found: share capacity for practice sites, and promote standardization
   across programs. When investigating best practices for established
   consortia, three main themes were identified. These included strategies
   for: (1) relationship building within consortia, (2) successful outcomes
   of consortia, and (3) sustainability. Successful outcomes included
   scholarship and, sometimes, program standardization. Sustainability was
   linked to structure/support and momentum. Respect was considered the
   foundation for collaborative relationships to flourish in these
   consortia.
   Conclusions. Pharmacy education consortia form through a process that
   involves relationship building to produce outcomes that promote
   sustainability, which benefits both pharmacy schools and individual
   faculty members. Consortium formation is a viable, productive, and often
   necessary institutional goal for pharmacy schools.},

Title = {Provisioning network slice for mobile content delivery in uncertain MEC
   environment},
Journal = {COMPUTER NETWORKS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {224},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Network Slicing (NS) and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) are recognized as a
   promising paradigm for mobile Content Delivery Network (CDN) by
   instantiating Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) on MEC platforms. Mobile
   network exhibits intrinsic dynamics, where user requests patterns vary
   in time and space due to human behaviors. The requirements and
   distribution of users are arbitrary spatio-temporal stochastic
   variables, which makes the deployment and reconfiguration of a CDN slice
   a challenging task. In this work, by adopting a periodical
   reconfiguration strategy, we consider a CDN slice system which operates
   in discrete time intervals. Within each time interval, we formalize the
   CDN-MEC-VNFs Planning (CMVP) problem based on uncertain programming to
   tackle the dynamic and uncertain mobile network environment, where user
   requests are treated as random variables with arbitrary pattern. Then,
   we propose a data-driven and learning-based algorithm which integrates
   Stochastic Simulation (SS), Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and
   meta-heuristic algorithm to determine the provisioning of the CDN slice
   from historical user requests information. The practicability of the
   proposed mechanism in offline training and online running are also
   discussed. Finally, we conducted intensive real-trace driven simulations
   to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on planning CDN slice
   with higher QoS under dynamic system environment and arbitrary user
   requests by comparing towards several baselines.},

Title = {Training and evaluating simulation debriefers in low-resource settings:
   lessons learned from Bihar, India},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},

Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {Background To develop effective and sustainable simulation training
   programs in low-resource settings, it is critical that facilitators are
   thoroughly trained in debriefing, a critical component of simulation
   learning. However, large knowledge gaps exist regarding the best way to
   train and evaluate debrief facilitators in low-resource settings.
   Methods Using a mixed methods approach, this study explored the
   feasibility of evaluating the debriefing skills of nurse mentors in
   Bihar, India. Videos of obstetric and neonatal post-simulation debriefs
   were assessed using two known tools: the Center for Advanced Pediatric
   and Perinatal Education (CAPE) tool and Debriefing Assessment for
   Simulation in Healthcare (DASH). Video data was used to evaluate
   interrater reliability and changes in debriefing performance over time.
   Additionally, twenty semi-structured interviews with nurse mentors
   explored perceived barriers and enablers of debriefing in Bihar. Results
   A total of 73 debriefing videos, averaging 18 min each, were analyzed by
   two raters. The CAPE tool demonstrated higher interrater reliability
   than the DASH; 13 of 16 CAPE indicators and two of six DASH indicators
   were judged reliable (ICC > 0.6 or kappa > 0.40). All indicators
   remained stable or improved over time. The number of `instructors
   questions,' the amount of `trainee responses,' and the ability to
   `organize the debrief' improved significantly over time (p < 0.01, p <
   0.01, p = 0.04). Barriers included fear of making mistakes, time
   constraints, and technical challenges. Enablers included creating a safe
   learning environment, using contextually appropriate debriefing
   strategies, and team building. Overall, nurse mentors believed that
   debriefing was a vital aspect of simulation-based training. Conclusion
   Simulation debriefing and evaluation was feasible among nurse mentors in
   Bihar. Results demonstrated that the CAPE demonstrated higher interrater
   reliability than the DASH and that nurse mentors were able to maintain
   or improve their debriefing skills overtime. Further, debriefing was
   considered to be critical to the success of the simulation training.
   However, fear of making mistakes and logistical challenges must be
   addressed to maximize learning. Teamwork, adaptability, and building a
   safe learning environment enhanced the quality enhanced the quality of
   simulation-based training, which could ultimately help to improve
   maternal and neonatal health outcomes in Bihar.},

Abstract = {We propose a methodological approach to build strategies for grouping
   scenarios as defined by the type of scenario decomposition, type of
   grouping, and the measures specifying scenario similarity. We evaluate
   these strategies in the context of stochastic network design by
   analyzing the behavior and performance of a new progressive
   hedging-based meta-heuristic for stochastic network design that solves
   subproblems comprising multiple scenarios. We compare the proposed
   strategies not only among themselves, but also against the strategy of
   grouping scenarios randomly and the lower bound provided by a
   state-of-the-art MIP solver. The results show that, by solving
   multi-scenario subproblems generated by the strategies we propose, the
   meta-heuristic produces better results in terms of solution quality and
   computing efficiency than when either single-scenario subproblems or
   multiple-scenario subproblems that are generated by picking scenarios at
   random are solved. The results also show that, considering all the
   strategies tested, the covering strategy with respect to commodity
   demands leads to the highest quality solutions and the quickest
   convergence. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Design, implementation and evaluation of novel work-based clinical
   assessment tool: An e-portfolio with embedded Entrustable Professional
   Activities},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {107},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: A new concept in work-based assessment, Entrustable
   Professional Activities (EPAs) describe key activities a work-ready
   practitioner can perform independently. EPAs are widely used in medicine
   to support competency-based education and are gaining acceptance in
   other professions such as nursing, pharmacy and dietetics. There is
   currently no widely accepted work-based assessment tool for student
   clinical placement assessment in dietetics and EPAs offer potential to
   address this gap.
   Objectives: To design, implement and evaluate a work-based assessment
   tool using EPAs embedded in an e-portfolio for use in clinical
   dietetics.
   Setting: An accredited dietetic training program in Australian
   university and affiliated metropolitan and rural hospitals.
   Participants: Three consecutive cohorts of final year dietetic students
   (n = 126) and their professional placement supervisors (n = 101).
   Methods: A working party consisting of dietetic academics with
   experience in clinical dietetics and education developed clinical
   dietetic EPAs and milestones that were mapped to the National Competency
   Standards for Dietitians in Australia. A design model incorporating
   multiple rounds of user feedback was used to create an e-portfolio with
   the EPAs embedded. Students and supervisors were invited to complete
   anonymous on-line surveys with Likert responses (1 = highly
   dissatisfied, 5 = highly satisfied) to evaluate the face validity,
   acceptability and feasibility of the tool.
   Results: A total of 37 EPAs were developed with an accompanying
   four-point entrustment scale to measure performance. Evaluation survey
   response rates were high and ranged from 35 to 45\% for students and
   57-83\% for supervisors across the study period. Both students and
   supervisors evaluated the tool positively with a mean overall
   satisfaction of 4.12 +/- 0.69 and 4.03 +/- 0.68, respectively. Survey
   items evaluating face validity, feasibility and acceptability scored
   >3.75 for both groups of users.
   Conclusions: The EPA based e-portfolio demonstrated face validity,
   feasibility and acceptability and offers potential for a widely accepted
   tool for work-based assessment of clinical dietetic students.},

Abstract = {Background/Purpose: Teacher educators must help students overcome faulty
   beliefs they developed through acculturation while also retaining highly
   qualified candidates through to graduation. This aspect of this study
   sought to understand physical education teacher education program
   coordinators' perspectives about their role in the process of student
   retention. Method: Participants included physical education teacher
   education program coordinators who completed an online survey as
   detailed in Chapter 4. Data were analyzed using descriptive and
   inferential statistics, with attention to differences across Carnegie
   Classification. Results: There was relative alignment between the
   perceived effectiveness of recruitment strategies and the extent to
   which they were employed. There was also a preference for strategies
   that develop relationships among students. Limited differences were
   noted across Carnegie Classifications. Discussion/Conclusion: Physical
   education doctoral programs should prepare future faculty members to
   serve retention roles, but complete retention of students whose beliefs
   do not align with best practice may not be desirable.},

Title = {How do nurse academics value and engage with evidence-based practice
   across Australia: Findings from a grounded theory study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {41},
Pages = {54-59},

Abstract = {Background: Integrating evidence-based practice (EBP) into undergraduate
   education and preparing future nurses to embrace EBP in clinical
   practice becomes paramount in today's complex and evolving healthcare
   environment. The role that EBP plays in the practical lives of nursing
   students will depend on the degree to which it is promoted by academics,
   how it is incorporated into courses and its application to clinical
   setting. Hence, nursing academics play a crucial role in influencing its
   integration into curricula. Drawn from a larger doctoral study, this
   paper presents findings discussing how nurse academics value and engage
   with EBP.
   Methods: Grounded theory was employed to explore processes used by
   nursing academics while incorporating EBP into teaching and learning
   practices. Twenty-three academics across Australian universities were
   interviewed. Nine were also observed while teaching undergraduate
   students. Data were collected from semi structured interviews and
   non-participant observation. In keeping with the tenets of grounded
   theory, data collection and analysis continued until theoretical
   saturation was reached. In total, four categories emerged. This paper
   focuses on the category conceptualised as Valuing and Engaging with EBP.
   Results: How nursing academics valued and engaged with EBP was closely
   associated with meanings they constructed around understanding it,
   attitudes and commitment to implementation while teaching and working
   clinically. Different opinions also existed in regard to what actually
   constituted EBP. However, they engaged with and valued EBP by keeping
   themselves up-to-date, being involved in research activities, using
   evidence in teaching, therefore leading by example. Participants
   identified a number of barriers influencing their engagement with EBP
   including heavy workloads, limited time, lack of commitment within their
   schools, lack of confidence with teaching EBP, and complexity of EBP
   application. Faculty clinical practice, committed academics, workload
   management and continuing education were highlighted as facilitators.
   Conclusion: A number of barriers prevented academics from fully engaging
   with EBP at academic or practice levels. Academic institutions and
   practice settings need to employ strategic planning to overcome such
   barriers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Joint Radio Map Construction and Dissemination in MEC Networks: A Deep
   Reinforcement Learning Approach},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUL 19},
Abstract = {With the development of 6G, the rapidly increasing number of smart
   devices deployed in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environment
   has been witnessed. The radio environment is showing a trend of
   complexity, and spectrum conflicts are becoming increasingly acute. User
   equipment (UE) can accurately sense and utilize spectrum resources
   through radio map (RM). However, the construction and dissemination of
   RM incur a heavy computational burden and large dissemination delay,
   which limit the real-time sensing of spatial spectrum situations. In
   this paper, we propose an RM construction and dissemination method based
   on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in the context of mobile edge
   computing (MEC) networks. We formulate the dissemination modes selection
   and resource allocation problems during RM construction and
   dissemination as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. Then, we
   propose an actor-critic-based joint offloading and resource allocation
   (ACJORA) algorithm for intelligent scheduling of computational
   offloading and resource allocation. We design a novel weighted loss
   function for the actor network, which combines the discrete actions for
   offloading decisions and the continuous actions for resource allocation.
   And the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce
   the cost of dissemination by optimizing the offloading strategies and
   resources, which is more applicable for real-time RM applications in MEC
   networks.},

Abstract = {The global challenge presented by COVID-19 is unparalleled. Shortages in
   healthcare staff and manpower bring the practical skills of medical
   students under the spotlight. However, before they can be placed on
   hospital frontlines, it is crucial to assess their preparedness for
   patient interaction. This can be achieved by comparing their behavioral
   dynamics to those of physicians. An online questionnaire was
   administered between March 20, 2020 and March 27, 2020. The preventive
   strategies adopted by medical students and physicians at different ages
   and levels of education were compared by using chi-square test where
   apvalue of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. We report
   that the demonstration of preventive behaviors increased with
   educational attainment and age. Older age groups avoided crowded areas,
   wore more masks, used disinfectants and did not touch their faces as
   compared to the younger participants (p< 0.001). Similarly, postgraduate
   doctors used more masks and disinfectants as compared to graduate
   doctors and medical students (p< 0.001). Based on our results, the lack
   of preventive behavior shown by medical students has implications for
   policy makers. We recommend short- and long-term changes to medical
   programs and admissions policies to equip medical students with the
   personal and professional skills to better contribute to the healthcare
   system in the present pandemic and beyond.},

Abstract = {The employability of graduates is a metric to assess the teaching
   achievements of higher education. Employability is complex,
   multi-dimensional, and is closely associated with specific industry
   characteristics. Thus, employability must be studied for a specific
   major in order to provide any practical guiding significance. The aim of
   this study was to determine the major factors contributing to the
   employability of graduates in civil engineering and provide the basis
   for setting appropriate goals to effectively cultivate civil engineering
   professionals by improving teaching strategies. Recent graduates of
   civil engineering programs who graduated between two and five years ago
   were selected as the subjects, and questionnaires were completed by 279
   graduates. The results showed that 88\% of civil engineering graduates
   are working in a position related to their specialty. Graduates were
   more satisfied with their current positions and work environments than
   they were with their salaries and future career development prospect. We
   analyzed the factors contributing to the employability of graduates, and
   defined three major factors of occupational quality, development
   potential, and professional capacity. These data suggest guidelines for
   the rational setting of goals to effectively cultivate civil engineering
   professionals, design an improved practical curriculum, adjust teaching
   methods, and modify course assessment indicators.},

Title = {Developing Computational Thinking Skills With Algorithm-Driven
   Spreadsheeting},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {153943-153959},
Abstract = {The paper presents the details of a four-year project to test the
   effectiveness of teaching spreadsheeting with spreadsheet programming,
   instead of the traditional, widely accepted surface approach methods.
   The novel method applied in the project, entitled Sprego (Spreadsheet
   Lego), is a concept-based problem-solving approach adapted from the
   didactics of other sciences and computer programming. In the
   experimental group contextualized, real-world programming problems are
   presented in a spreadsheet environment. A semi-unplugged data-driven
   analysis is carried out based on each problem, which is followed by the
   building of a feasible algorithm, expressed by natural language
   expressions. The coding is completed in the following step by applying a
   limited number of spreadsheet (Sprego) functions, multilevel, and array
   formulas. The final steps of the process are discussion and debugging.
   On the other hand, classical, tool-centered approaches are applied in
   the control groups. Our research reveals that the traditional surface
   approach methods for teaching spreadsheeting do not provide long
   lasting, reliable knowledge which would provide students and end-users
   with effective problem-solving strategies, while Sprego does. Beyond
   this finding, the project proves that Sprego supports schema
   construction and extended abstraction, which is one of the major hiatus
   points of traditional surface navigation methods. The project also
   reveals that developing computational thinking skills should not be
   downgraded, and the misconceptions of self-taught end-users and
   user-friendly applications should be reconsidered, especially their
   application in educational environments. Gaining effective computer
   problem-solving skills and knowledge-transfer abilities is not magic,
   but a time-consuming process which requires consciously developed and
   effective methods, and teachers who accept the incremental nature of the
   sciences.},

Title = {A thematic analysis of students' discussions on death and body donation
   in international online focus groups},
Journal = {ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 20},
Abstract = {Historically, Anatomy education is an in-person discipline involving
   exposure to human body donors that facilitates personal and professional
   growth through, in part, the initiation of reflection on the topic of
   death. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic the decreased exposure to
   cadaveric anatomy for many health professions students may have
   influenced the depth of their individual reflections on this topic.
   Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate the effect of an alternate
   approach-focus group discussions between peers with varying degrees of
   exposure to cadaveric material-that may offer one strategy to stimulate
   deep reflection on the topic of death. A programmatic intervention was
   introduced, wherein students (n = 221) from 13 international
   universities discussed differences in their anatomy courses during small
   focus group sessions as part of an online exchange program. An inductive
   semantic thematic analysis was conducted on responses to an open-ended
   text-response question on how the activity influenced students'
   reflections about death. Resulting themes were organized into categories
   that described the content and topics of the students' discussions as
   they grappled with this sensitive topic. The students reportedly engaged
   in deep reflection and expressed an increased sense of connectedness
   with their peers, despite their disparate exposure levels to cadaveric
   anatomy and being physically distanced. This demonstrates that focus
   groups with students experiencing different laboratory contexts can be
   used to help all students reflect on the topic of death and that
   interchanges between dissecting and non-dissecting students can initiate
   thoughts about death and body donation among non-dissecting students.},

Abstract = {Computational thinking and creative thinking are valuable tools both
   within and outside of computer science (CS). The goal of the project
   discussed here is to increase students' achievement in CS courses
   through a series of computational creativity exercises (CCEs). In this
   paper, the framework of CCEs is described, and the results of two
   separate studies on their impact on student achievement are presented.
   Students in introductory CS courses completed CCEs as part of those
   courses. Students in Study 1 came from a variety of programs, and
   students in Study 2 were engineering majors. A profiling approach was
   used to test whether the impact of the CCEs could be accounted for by
   differences in students' motivated and self-regulated engagement.
   Overall, CCEs had positive impacts on students' grades and knowledge
   test scores, and although there were differences in achievement across
   the profiles, the impact of the CCEs was generally consistent across
   profiles. The CCEs appear to be a promising way to increase student
   achievement in introductory CS courses. Implications and directions for
   future research are discussed.},

Abstract = {Competency-based medical education (CBME) aims to bring about the
   sequential acquisition of competencies required for practice. Although
   it is being adopted in centers of medical education around the globe,
   there is little evidence concerning whether, in comparison with
   traditional methods, CBME produces physicians who are better prepared
   for the practice environment and contributes to improved patient
   outcomes. Consequently, the authors, an international group of
   collaborators, wrote this article to provide guidance regarding the
   evaluation of CBME programs.
   CBME is a complex service intervention consisting of multiple activities
   that contribute to the achievement of a variety of outcomes over time.
   For this reason, it is difficult to apply traditional methods of program
   evaluation, which require conditions of control and predictability, to
   CBME. To address this challenge, the authors describe an approach that
   makes explicit the multiple potential linkages between program
   activities and outcomes. Referred to as contribution analysis (CA), this
   theory-based approach to program evaluation provides a systematic way to
   make credible causal claims under conditions of complexity. Although CA
   has yet to be applied to medical education, the authors describe how a
   six-step model and a postulated theory of change could be used to
   examine the link between CBME, physicians' preparation for practice, and
   patient care outcomes.
   The authors argue that adopting the methods of CA, particularly the
   rigor in thinking required to link program activities, outcomes, and
   theory, will serve to strengthen understanding of the impact of CBME
   over time.},

Title = {Reflect and Reset: Black Academic Voices Call the Graduate Medical
   Education Community to Action},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the great achievements that the
   biomedical community can accomplish, but raised the question: Can the
   same medical community that developed a complex vaccine in less than a
   year during a pandemic help to defeat social injustice and ameliorate
   the epidemic of health inequity? In this article, the authors, a group
   of Black academics, call on the graduate medical education (GME)
   community to reset its trajectory toward solutions for achieving
   diversity, improving inclusion, and combating racism using education as
   the new vector. Sponsoring institutions, which include universities,
   academic medical centers, teaching hospitals, and teaching health
   centers, are the center of the creation and dissemination of
   scholarship. They are often the main sources of care for many
   historically marginalized communities. The GME learning environment must
   provide the next generation of medical professionals with an
   understanding of how racism continues to have a destructive influence on
   health care professionals and their patients. Residents have the
   practical experience of longitudinal patient care, and a significant
   portion of an individual's professional identity is formed during GME;
   therefore, this is a key time to address explicit stereotyping and to
   identify implicit bias at the individual level. The authors propose 3
   main reset strategies for GME incorporating inclusive pedagogy and
   structural competency into education, building a diverse and inclusive
   learning environment, and activating community engagement- as well as
   tactics that sponsoring institutions can adapt to address racism at the
   individual learner, medical education program, and institutional levels.
   Sustained, comprehensive, and systematic implementation of multiple
   tactics could make a significant impact. It is an academic and moral
   imperative for the medical community to contribute to the design and
   implementation of solutions that directly address racism, shifting how
   resident physicians are educated and modeling just and inclusive
   behaviors for the next generation of medical leaders.},

Abstract = {Reinforcement learning has recently made great progress in various
   challenging domains such as board game of Go and MOBA game of StarCraft
   II. Policy gradient based reinforcement learning method has become the
   mainstream due to its effectiveness and simplicity both in discrete and
   continuous scenarios. However, policy gradient methods commonly involve
   function approximation and work in an on-policy fashion, which leads to
   high variance and low sample efficiency. This paper introduces a novel
   policy gradient method to improve the sample efficiency via a pair of
   trajectory based prioritized replay buffers and reduce the variance in
   training with a target network whose weights are updated in a ``soft{''}
   manner. We evaluate our method on the reinforcement learning suit of
   Open AI Gym tasks, and the results show that the proposed method can
   learn more steadily and achieve higher performance than existing
   methods.},

Abstract = {The subject of probability and statistics is easily dismissed by
   students as assemblages of formulae to be rote-memorized. We propose
   here an integration of simulation-based activities with certain
   mathematical paradoxes using patchwork assessment to first-year
   undergraduates, such that they can better appreciate the real-world
   context of probability and statistics. The proposed examples alongside
   various facilitation skills for the instructor are discussed. We also
   provide an original spreadsheet simulation program in Excel and Visual
   Basic for Applications to reproduce the numerical experiments. This
   program is capable of running Monte Carlo simulations for all three
   seminal Parrondo's paradox variants, and can be easily used by students
   and instructors; moreover, the computed datasets and code are
   fully-transparent, thereby allowing interactive discussions,
   modifications and extensions, and further analyses. Our findings suggest
   that the proposed teaching strategy is useful, and we hope that this
   work will initiate the significant adoption of paradoxical simulations
   in teaching practice. The interactive program is freely available on
   open science framework.},

Title = {Socialization to professionalism in medical schools: a Canadian
   experience},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Month = {NOV 17},
Abstract = {Background: Accrediting bodies now recognize the importance of
   developing the professionalism competency, by setting standards that
   require medical schools to identify where professionalism is addressed
   and how it is evaluated within the formal curriculum.
   The objective of this study was to compare how professionalism
   competency is formally addressed in the curricula of Canadian medical
   schools, and to better understand the Canadian approach to reporting and
   remediation of lapses.
   Methods: A literature review was performed and with the input of the
   AFMC(Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada) Professionalism
   group, questionnaires were generated. An electronic survey was
   circulated to key leaders across the country at all the medical schools.
   In-depth telephone interviews were used to further explore themes, and a
   subsequent focus group was held to discuss challenges, particularly
   related to reporting and remediation.
   Results: The preponderance of formal professionalism teaching remains in
   the form of lectures and small group sessions in the preclinical years.
   Formal teaching declines significantly in the clerkship/clinical years.
   Evaluation is usually performed by a clinical supervisor, but OSCE,
   portfolio, and concern notes are increasingly used. Role modeling is
   heavily relied upon in clinical years, suggesting faculty training can
   help ensure clinical teachers recognize their influence on trainees.
   Formal remediation strategies are in place at most schools, and often
   involve essay writing, reflection exercises, or completion of learning
   modules about professionalism. Lack of clarity on what defines a lapse
   and fear of reprisal (for both trainees and faculty) limits reporting.
   Conclusions: This study provides an overview of how professional
   identity formation is supported in the Canadian context, guided by the
   standards set out by CanMEDS. Despite a rich literature that describes
   the definition, program design and evaluation methods for
   professionalism, in some areas of the curriculum there is still an
   opportunity to ensure programs embrace the suggested framework. Examples
   of teaching and evaluation methods, deficiencies in the clinical years
   of study (clerkship) and challenges in addressing lapses and
   organizational structure are identified. The results help identify the
   gaps that need to be addressed and some solutions that can be modeled at
   other academic institutions.},

Title = {Pelvic and breast examination skills curricula in United States medical
   schools: a survey of obstetrics and gynecology clerkship directors},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Month = {DEC 16},
Abstract = {Background: Learning to perform pelvic and breast examinations produces
   anxiety for many medical students. Clerkship directors have long sought
   strategies to help students become comfortable with the sensitive nature
   of these examinations. Incorporating standardized patients, simulation
   and gynecologic teaching associates (GTAs) are approaches gaining
   widespread use. However, there is a paucity of literature guiding
   optimal approach and timing. Our primary objective was to survey
   obstetrics and gynecology (Ob/Gyn) clerkship directors regarding timing
   and methods for teaching and assessment of pelvic and breast examination
   skills in United States medical school curricula, and to assess
   clerkship director satisfaction with current educational strategies at
   their institutions.
   Methods: Ob/Gyn clerkship directors from all 135 Liaison Committee on
   Medical Education accredited allopathic United States medical schools
   were invited to complete an anonymous 15-item web-based questionnaire.
   Results: The response rate was 70\%. Pelvic and breast examinations are
   most commonly taught during the second and third years of medical
   school. Pelvic examinations are primarily taught during the Ob/Gyn and
   Family Medicine ( FM) clerkships, while breast examinations are taught
   during the Ob/Gyn, Surgery and FM clerkships. GTAs teach pelvic and
   breast examinations at 72 and 65\% of schools, respectively. Over 60\%
   of schools use some type of simulation to teach examination skills.
   Direct observation by Ob/Gyn faculty is used to evaluate pelvic exam
   skills at 87\% of schools and breast exam skills at 80\% of schools.
   Only 40\% of Ob/Gyn clerkship directors rated pelvic examination
   training as excellent, while 18\% rated breast examination training as
   excellent.
   Conclusions: Pelvic and breast examinations are most commonly taught
   during the Ob/Gyn clerkship using GTAs, simulation trainers and clinical
   patients, and are assessed by direct faculty observation during the
   Ob/Gyn clerkship. While the majority of Ob/Gyn clerkship directors were
   not highly satisfied with either pelvic or breast examination training
   programs, they were less likely to describe their breast examination
   training programs as excellent as compared to pelvic examination
   training-overall suggesting an opportunity for improvement. The survey
   results will be useful in identifying future challenges in teaching such
   skills in a cost-effective manner.},

Abstract = {The education of future health care professionals must involve
   activities where interprofessional collaboration and the functioning of
   interdisciplinary teams are the goals and not the exceptions. This type
   of interprofessional education (IPE) will benefit students as they will
   be better able to communicate with and mobilize the skills of other
   health care workers, work toward common goals related to patient care,
   and develop a more cost-effective treatment strategy in the long term.
   Such an IPE program was initiated in the clinical anatomy course for
   physician assistant students from the University of Mount Union that was
   taught, in part, by medical students from the Cleveland Clinic Lerner
   College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University. Surveys of both
   student groups at the end of the course indicated that although this was
   a useful IPE experience, the value of this program as an IPE experience
   was not entirely appreciated by the participating students. It turned
   out that although the goals and importance of these types of IPE
   activities are clear to the faculty, they must also be made clear to all
   of the students. Anat Sci Educ 8: 381-385. (c) 2015 American Association

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To define cognitive apprenticeship and describe how it can be
   applied to orthopedic education.
   DESIGN: Traditional apprenticeships have been used through history as a
   teaching model for wide variety of skills. These apprenticeships are
   characterized by practical, on-the-job training in which the apprentice
   observes and assists a master in the completion of a task, and thereby
   learns the skills needed to complete that task on his or her own.
   RESULTS: Cognitive apprenticeship is differentiated from the traditional
   apprenticeship model primarily by its educational goals. Cognitive
   apprenticeships are used to teach skills which require internal though
   processes which cannot be readily observed externally by the teacher or
   the student.
   CONCLUSION: Here, we review the history of the cognitive apprenticeship
   concept, its basic principles, its applications to a wide variety of
   educational circumstances, and its potential use a framework for
   developing orthopedic curricula. (C) 2019 Association of Program

Title = {Real-Time Generation Method of Oil Painting Style Brushstrokes Based on
   Inverse Reinforcement Learning},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUN 18},
Abstract = {A popular style in modern graphics programs like GIMP, Photoshop, and
   Painter is brushstroke artwork, a classic artwork that is still
   extensively practiced today. Regarding successive decision-making
   situations with ambiguity, reinforcement learning approaches can be
   quite helpful. In RL, a reward-enabled agent interacts with a dynamic
   situation to discover a strategy. To use current RL techniques, we must
   first offer a reward function, a concise depiction of the designer's
   purpose. Hence, inverse-RL (IRL), an expansion of RL, was born. It
   solves this difficulty via developing the reward function from skilled
   demonstrations. In this article, we present a novel sundry-fidelity
   Bayesian optimization (SFBO) approach to boost the ability of the IRL
   regarding oil painting style brushstrokes. Finally, the performance of
   the proposed approach is examined and compared with the standard
   approaches to achieve the highest effectiveness in oil painting. The
   findings are depicted in graphical representation through Origin tool.
   Approaches based on RL can be quite helpful in ambiguous decision-making
   situations. Today's RL approaches must include a reward function, which
   embodies the designer's intent. To reduce the dimensions of the data,
   the proposed SFBO comprises stages of data preprocessing and feature
   extraction. The proposed technique was evaluated against the existing
   techniques in terms of accuracy, information loss, average MSE, and time
   consumption. Compared to the existing approaches, the proposed approach
   was the most effective.},

Abstract = {Effective dimensionality reduction is a classical research area for many
   large-scale analysis tasks in computer vision. Several recent methods
   attempt to learn either graph embedding or binary hashing for fast and
   accurate applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to
   automatically learn the task-specific compact coding, called
   evolutionary compact embedding (ECE), which can be regarded as an
   optimization algorithm combining genetic programming (GP) and a boosting
   trick. As an evolutionary computation methodology, GP can solve problems
   inspired by natural evolution without any prior knowledge of the
   solutions. In our evolutionary architecture, each bit of ECE is
   iteratively computed using a binary classification function, which is
   generated through GP evolving by jointly minimizing its empirical risk
   with the AdaBoost strategy on a training set. We address this as greedy
   optimization leading to small Hamming distances for similar samples and
   large distances for dissimilar samples. We then evaluate ECE on four
   image datasets: USPS digital hand-writing, CMU PIE face, CIFAR-10 tiny
   image and SUN397 scene, showing the accurate and robust performance of
   our method for large-scale image classification. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {Large-scale graph processing plays an increasingly important role for
   many data-related applications. Recently GPU has been adopted to
   accelerate various graph processing algorithms. However, since the
   architecture of GPU is very different from traditional computing model,
   the learning threshold for developing GPU-based applications is high. In
   this paper, we propose a GPU-based parallel graph processing system
   named GPregel to tackle this challenge. GPregel is a BSP model in graph
   processing such as Pregel from Google. It harnesses a lightweight
   compiler to hide the underlying complexity of the parallel processing
   details and simplifies programming, so that it greatly reduces the
   difficulty in utilizing the GPU to solve graph computing problems.
   Moreover, GPregel develops several optimizations for enhancing the
   performance, including (1) a special storage model for BSP model running
   on GPU, which overcomes the execution divergence and irregular memory
   access by coarse-grained designs; (2) a warp-level optimal strategy
   Parallelized-Messages-Sending and a thread-level optimal strategy
   Threads-Merge-Executing to accelerate the computations of high degree
   vertexes and low degree vertexes respectively; (3) messages copy
   mechanism optimization that utilizes a shared array and a rolling array
   to speed up the messages copy. Experiments demonstrate that GPregel can
   achieve high performance with little work for developers.},

Title = {Engaging All Stakeholders to Create a Trusted, Data-Driven, Process
   Improvement Approach to Addressing Learner Mistreatment},
Journal = {TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 8},
Abstract = {Problem: Learner mistreatment has remained an ongoing challenge in
   academic medicine despite accreditation requirements mandating that
   every program has systems in place to prevent and respond to
   mistreatment. While efforts vary across institutions, much remains
   unanswered in the literature about best practices. Additionally, for the
   foreseeable future, challenges in the learning environment will likely
   continue and potentially worsen, given the confluence of multiple
   external stressors including the COVID-19 pandemic, faculty burnout and
   general political divisiveness in the nation. It is essential,
   therefore, to focus on indicators of improvement via process metrics
   such as knowledge and awareness of mistreatment policies and procedures,
   willingness to report, reasons for not reporting, and satisfaction with
   having made a report, while simultaneously focusing on the more complex
   challenge of eliminating mistreatment occurrences. Intervention: We
   describe the aspects of our mistreatment prevention and response system
   first implemented in 2017 along with process and outcome measures. The
   interventions included expanding our policy outlining appropriate
   conduct in the teacher-learner relationship; a graduated response
   protocol to allegations of mistreatment with a clear escalation
   approach; an online reporting system; a graduate medical education exit
   survey which mirrors the AAMC Graduation Questionnaire on mistreatment;
   a robust communication and professional development campaign; a
   comprehensive data dashboard; and a comprehensive summary report
   dissemination plan. Context: The interventions were implemented at the
   largest allopathic medical school in the U.S., with nine campuses across
   the state. The system is available to all learners, including medical
   students, graduate students, residents, and fellows. Impact: Both
   institutional and national data sources have informed the continuous
   improvement strategies. Data from internal reporting systems,
   institutional surveys, and national data are presented from 2017 to
   2021. Findings include an increasing number of incidents reported each
   year, including confidential reports from students who include their
   contact information rather than report anonymously, which we view as an
   indicator of learner trust in the system. Our data also show consistent
   improvements in learners' awareness of the policy and procedures and
   satisfaction with having made a report. We also include other data such
   as the nature of complaints submitted and timeliness of our
   institutional response. Lessons Learned: We present several lessons
   learned that may guide other institutions looking to similarly improve
   their mistreatment systems, such as a close partnership between faculty
   affairs, diversity affairs, and educational affairs leadership;
   communication, professional development, and training through multiple
   venues and with all stakeholders; easily accessible reporting with
   anonymous and confidential options and the ability to report on behalf
   of others; policy development guidance; data transparency and
   dissemination; and trust-building activities and ongoing feedback from
   learners.},

Title = {A bi-objective load balancing model in a distributed simulation system
   using NSGA-II and MOPSO approaches},

Abstract = {High level architecture (HLA) is a software-architecture specification
   of a distributed simulation system which does not involve load
   balancing. As a result, problems of long simulation time and distortion
   caused by unequally distributed simulation tasks cannot be solved in the
   simulation process of HLA. In this paper, the simulation system based on
   the component level will be studied, and problems of load imbalances
   will be tackled. The goal is to find a set of Pareto optimal solutions
   to minimize the imbalance of the computation load and the total
   communication load with load limitation constraints in the model. To
   formulate this problem, a new integer programming model is presented.
   Both a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with elitist strategy
   (NSGA-II) and a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) are
   adopted to solve the problem. Different global best selection methods
   (crowding distance, adaptive grids and comprehensive ranking) and
   perturbation methods (rapidly decreasing and elitist learning strategy)
   for MOPSO are analyzed. Since the parameters of the algorithms have
   significant effects on their performance, the Taguchi method with a
   novel response value is utilized to tune the parameters of the proposed
   algorithms. Five performance metrics are used to evaluate the results of
   these algorithms. Based on the results, a networked control simulation
   platform will be used to test and verify the schemes. Numerical results
   show that the proposed MOPSO with ELS operator outperforms other
   proposed algorithms in solving the problem. In addition, the proposed
   strategies could solve problems of load imbalances in systems based on
   HLA. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The ever-increasing impact of molecular quantum calculations over
   chemical sciences implies a strong and urgent need for the elaboration
   of proper teaching strategies in university curricula. In such
   perspective, this paper proposes an extensive project for a
   student-driven, cooperative, from-scratch implementation of a general
   Hartree-Fock self-consistent-field code. The project is primarily (but
   not exclusively) intended for a one-semester laboratory course in
   graduate physical-chemistry curricula: students are divided into working
   groups devoted to the implementation of specific subroutines, which are
   then gradually assembled in the final code. The resulting program is not
   limited to the overused, trivial case of two-electron diatomic systems,
   but can treat arbitrary closed-shell molecules with first- and
   second-row atoms at the STO-3G basis-set level and includes very useful
   features such as geometry optimization, population analysis, and
   calculation of dipole moments. The heart of the program is the by now
   historical algorithm devised by S. F. Boys for evaluating generic
   molecular integrals through repeated differentiation of fundamental
   integrals involving only s-type Gaussian orbitals. Though highly
   inefficient and completely outdated from a computational point of view,
   this method is reasonably fast for small- and even medium-size molecules
   (for instance, fixed-geometry calculations on methane and benzene take
   about 1 s and 6 min, respectively, on a modest home computer). More
   importantly, unlike newer advanced algorithms, it can be easily
   understood and implemented by students: thus, it becomes particularly
   appealing for a didactics based on reflexivity and active knowledge
   building, rather than on a comfortable but often premature and
   uncritical use of ready-made professional software packages.},

Title = {Broadening Participation in Biology Education Research: Engaging
   Community College Students and Faculty},
Journal = {CBE-LIFE SCIENCES EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},

Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Nearly half of all undergraduates are enrolled at community colleges
   (CCs), including the majority of U.S. students who represent groups
   underserved in the sciences. Yet only a small minority of studies
   published in discipline-based education research journals address CC
   biology students, faculty, courses, or authors. This marked
   underrepresentation of CC biology education research (BER) limits the
   availability of evidence that could be used to increase CC student
   success in biology programs. To address this issue, a diverse group of
   stakeholders convened at the Building Capacity for Biology Education
   Research at Community Colleges meeting to discuss how to increase the
   prevalence of CC BER and foster participation of CC faculty as BER
   collaborators and authors. The group identified characteristics of CCs
   that make them excellent environments for studying biology teaching and
   learning, including student diversity and institutional cultures that
   prioritize teaching, learning, and assessment. The group also identified
   constraints likely to impede BER at CCs: limited time, resources,
   support, and incentives, as well as misalignment between doing research
   and CC faculty identities as teachers. The meeting culminated with
   proposing strategies for faculty, administrators, journal editors,
   scientific societies, and funding agencies to better support CC BER.},

Abstract = {Mobile edge computing which provides computing capabilities at the edge
   of the radio access network can help smart home reduce response time.
   However, the limited computing capacity of edge servers is the
   bottlenecks for the development of edge computing. We integrate cloud
   computing and edge computing in the Internet of Things to expand the
   capabilities. Nevertheless, the cost of leasing computing resources has
   been seldom considered. In this paper, we study the joint transmission
   power and resource allocation to minimize the users' overhead which is
   measured by the sum of energy consumption and cost leasing servers. We
   formulate the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming which is
   NP-hard and present the Branch-and-Bound to solve it. Due to high
   complexity, a learning method is proposed to accelerate the algorithm.
   The branching policy can be learned to reduce the time-cost of the
   Branch-and-Bound algorithm. Simulation results show our approach can
   improve the Branch-and-Bound efficiency and performs closely to the
   traditional branching scheme.},

Title = {Designing Well-Being: Using Design Thinking to Engage Residents in
   Developing Well-Being Interventions},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {95},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1038-1042},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Problem
   Improving well-being in residency requires solutions that focus on
   organizational factors and the individual needs of residents, yet there
   are few examples of successful strategies to address this challenge.
   Design thinking (DT), or human-centered design, is an approach to
   problem-solving that focuses on understanding emotions and human
   dynamics and may be ideally suited to tackling well-being as a complex
   problem. The authors taught residents to use DT techniques to identify,
   analyze, and address organizational well-being challenges.
   Approach
   Internal medicine residents at the University of California, San
   Francisco completed an 8-month DT program in 2016-2017. The program
   consisted of four 2-hour workshops with small group project work between
   sessions. In each session, resident teams shared their progress and
   analyzed emerging themes to solve well-being problems. At the conclusion
   of the program, they summarized the final design principles and
   recommendations that emerged from their work and were interviewed about
   DT as a strategy for developing well-being interventions for residents.
   Outcomes
   Eighteen residents worked in teams to design solutions to improve:
   community and connection, space for reflection, peer support, and
   availability of individualized wellness. The resulting recommendations
   led to new interventions to improve wellbeing through near-peer
   communities. Residents emphasized how DT enhanced their creative
   thinking and trust in the residency program. They reported that not
   having enough time to work on projects between sessions and losing
   momentum during their clinical rotations were their biggest challenges.
   Next Steps
   Residents found DT useful for completing needs assessments, piloting
   interventions, and outlining essential design principles to improve
   well-being in residency. DT's focus on human values may be particularly
   suited to developing well-being interventions to enhance institutional
   community and culture. One outcome-that DT promoted creativity and trust
   for participants-may have applications in other spheres of medical
   education.},

Abstract = {Writing is a critical skill for graduate students, but few studies in
   the literature describe how it is supported in the training of
   biomedical graduate students. The Initiative for Maximizing Student
   Development program at Loma Linda University aims to develop this
   important skill in its students through an integrated, structured
   writing intervention. Specifically, the program hired a writing
   specialist who taught writing seminars, facilitated writing and
   publishing workshops, and mentored students in one-on-one writing
   conferences. Doctoral students in the program, primarily
   underrepresented minority students with some not having English as a
   first language, all exhibited writing apprehension and blocking
   behaviors. The percentage of students graduating, publishing, and
   entering science careers, all of which require writing, is high. To
   yield insight into how this intervention worked, we conducted in-depth
   interviews of six of the earliest graduates, derived themes, analyzed
   data from pre- and post-assessments, and described their publication
   records. Participating students increased their writing confidence,
   adopted productive writing strategies, decreased writing anxiety and
   blocking behaviors, and published successfully.},

Title = {Applying integrative situational cases into the effectiveness of
   interprofessional education programs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING},
Year = {2020},
Month = {2020 JAN 1},
Abstract = {During the medical professionals receiving their education, the
   educational facilities and the environment are almost isolated, and the
   understanding of the related clinical professionals is limited. During
   the student period, interactive learning opportunities among different
   professionals shall be established to enhance mutual understanding and
   facilitate teamwork after entering the workplace. Therefore, this study
   explores the effectiveness of teamwork in senior nursing students via
   investigating the efficiency of Truku tribal's integrative situational
   cases into inter-professional education workshop. Taking the
   inter-professional education workshop model as an intervention strategy,
   senior college students from the Department of Medicine, Physical
   Therapy and Nursing were invited to participate in the 4-h workshop,
   before and after the first class. Employing the team-based self-designed
   questionnaire to collect the differences in cultural care and teamwork
   cognitive ability before and after the workshop participation, the SPSS
   22.0 version software was used for descriptive and inferential
   statistical data analysis. A total of 45 valid pre-test questionnaires
   were collected, with a 100\% recovery rate; and 43 valid post-test
   questionnaires were collected, with a 95.56\% response rate.
   Independentttest or two-sample t-test was used for ``the workshop of the
   intervention on the integration of the Truku member's health cases into
   inter-professional education{''}, the teamwork ability (t = - 3.27, p <
   0.05), cultural care ability (t = - 6.74, p < 0.05), and the overall
   mean (t = - 6.14, p < 0.05) are all reached statistically significant
   differences. The involvement of situational cases in education workshops
   not only enhances students' teamwork and communication skills, but also
   positively evaluates inter-professional activities, inferring the
   learning process of senior nursing students. Thus, in the multicultural
   Taiwanese society, continuous promotion and application should be
   carried out to create a friendly medical institution so as to improve
   the medical environment and efficiency through effective teamwork
   skills.},

Abstract = {A tablet PC is a laptop computer with a touch screen and a digital pen
   or stylus that can be used for handwritten notes and drawings. The use
   of tablet PCs has been investigated in many disciplines such as
   engineering, mathematics, science, and education. The purpose of this
   article is to explore student and faculty attitudes toward and
   experiences with tablet PCs 6 years after the implementation of a tablet
   PC program in the College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM) at Kansas State
   University (K-State). This study reports that the use of tablet PCs has
   enhanced students' learning experiences through learner-interface
   interaction, learner-content interaction, learner-instructor
   interaction, and learner-learner interaction. This study also identifies
   digital distraction as the major negative experience with tablet PCs
   during class time. The tablet PC program provides CVM faculty the
   potential to pursue technology integration strategies that support
   expected learning outcomes and provides students the potential to
   develop self-monitoring and self-discipline skills that support learning
   with digital technologies.},

Abstract = {The commitment and responsibility of new chemists is key for a world
   free of chemical weapons and illicit drugs, and for the development of
   ecofriendly technologies and a healthy environment. However, with a
   tight academic schedule for undergraduate and postgraduate students, it
   is difficult to find room for an appropriate discussion and debate about
   the dual use of the chemical sciences. Encouraged by the initiatives of
   the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on education
   about the prevention of illicit purposes of chemistry, we have developed
   a one-day workshop, called the Itinerant Lecture, that covers
   theoretical aspects combined with activities to promote critical
   thinking among students. The main topics are presented in an engaging
   way that is open to discussion and includes activities such as fictional
   case analyses and role-playing, which allow students to consider the
   problematic aspects of their roles as scientists. This workshop has been
   running for the last 5 years, with apparently very high acceptance by
   students and teachers in the chemistry field. The use of videos,
   role-playing, and an active-learning strategy for the topics becomes an
   excellent approach to introduce chemistry students and teachers to
   concepts such as professional responsibility and dual use of knowledge
   in the sciences and their implications in the production of chemical
   weapons and other illegal uses.},

Title = {Emotional intelligence competencies in the undergraduate nursing
   curriculum: A descriptive qualitative study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {119},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: The evidence suggests that emotional intelligence is an
   essential interpersonal skill for the nursing profession, but there is a
   paucity in the literature about how these competencies are integrated
   into the undergraduate curriculum.
   Objectives: To explore how undergraduate nursing faculty incorporated
   emotional intelligence competencies in baccalaureate nursing education.
   Design and settings: The design for this study was a qualitative
   descriptive design. Participants were recruited from eight public
   universities with pre-licensure baccalaureate nursing programs across
   the United States.
   Participants: A purposive and network sample of full-time, didactic
   nursing faculty members (n = 8) from pre-licensure baccalaureate nursing
   programs throughout the United States.
   Methods: A total of eight semi-structured interviews were conducted via
   Skype or Zoom between June and October 2020, with a mean duration of 58
   min. All were transcribed verbatim. Data analysis continued through
   thematic analysis and constant comparison. The study is reported in
   accordance with COREQ guidelines and received IRB approval.
   Results: Three themes and eight sub-themes were found within the data:
   (a) formal strategies (communication, professional formation,
   empathy/caring), (b) informal strategies (interpersonal development,
   practice what you preach, teaching strategies), and (c) need for a
   systems approach (organizational framework, organizational breakdown).
   Conclusions: The results suggested that participants used a combination
   of formal and informal strategies to cultivate emotional intelligence
   competence in their students and that a systems approach may be the best
   strategy to support curricular consistency throughout the program of
   study. Faculty participants unanimously agreed that emotional
   intelligence skills were essential components of the undergraduate
   nursing curriculum and were crucial to cultivating a healthy academic
   environment.},

Title = {Promoting Cancer Control Training in Resource Limited Environments:
   Lagos, Nigeria},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CANCER EDUCATION},
Year = {2014},

Abstract = {In resource limited nations, cancer control is often a lower priority
   issue creating challenges for the prevention, early diagnosis, and
   treatment of cancer. Training and education are vital components of
   efforts to tackle this problem. A 3-day cancer control workshop was
   conducted at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH),
   Nigeria, in 2013. The curriculum included didactic lectures, panel
   discussions, and interactive sessions on local cancer statistics,
   preventive strategies, cancer registries, screening and diagnostic
   options, and treatment approaches with limited resources (chemotherapy,
   radiotherapy, surgery, and palliative care) and several site-specific
   (breast, lung, cervical, prostate, and colon) topics. Pre-workshop and
   post-workshop questionnaires were completed by participants. Eighty-six
   percent of the 50 workshop participants completed at least one
   questionnaire. Participants were mainly nurses and physicians (89 \% of
   responders), and 40 \% reported > 25 years of practice experience. The
   more common local needs identified were professional education (65 \%)
   and increasing public cancer awareness (63 \%). The greatest interest
   for future programs was on research collaborations (70 \%). An immediate
   impact of the workshop was the commencement of monthly tumor board
   conferences and a review of the current cancer registry data. Capacity
   building is critical for the execution of effective cancer control
   strategies. Conducting collaborative workshops represents a
   cost-effective means of launching programs and energizing the medical
   community to pursue ongoing education and research addressing the
   anticipated cancer epidemic on the African continent.},

Title = {The UnEssay project as an enriching alternative to practical exams in
   pre-professional and graduate education},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 MAR 28},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated changes in educational strategy,
   including modification of assessments. Students in the Master of
   Biomedical Sciences (MBS) program at Duke University School of Medicine
   are required to take a course entitled Organ Systems (OS), which
   includes organ histology. In pre-pandemic circumstances, cumulative
   histology knowledge was assessed in the form of a practical exam. This
   year we used the UnEssay Project in lieu of the practical exam to assess
   student competency in organ system histology. Students worked within
   their team-based learning (TBL) teams and submitted unique UnEssay
   projects in a variety of formats. Notable examples of submitted projects
   include: a histological poetry slam, a histological travel guide, a
   TikTok histology tutorial, and histology Jeopardy. Student feedback on
   the project was overwhelmingly positive and each team met the main
   project objectives. We utilised the UnEssay Project as a means to assess
   student knowledge and competency in identification of histological
   features and organs. We applied this project format as a means for
   assessment, but believe that other applications within basic science
   education, including graduate courses, would be equally as successful.
   Based on positive student feedback, we plan to use the UnEssay Project
   again in the 2021-2022 academic year.},

Abstract = {This work addresses inverse linear optimization, where the goal is to
   infer the unknown cost vector of a linear program. Specifically, we
   consider the data-driven setting in which the available data are noisy
   observations of optimal solutions that correspond to different instances
   of the linear program. We introduce a new formulation of the problem
   that, compared with other existing methods, allows the recovery of a
   less restrictive and generally more appropriate admissible set of cost
   estimates. It can be shown that this inverse optimization problem yields
   a finite number of solutions, and we develop an exact two-phase
   algorithm to determine all such solutions. Moreover, we propose an
   efficient decomposition algorithm to solve large instances of the
   problem. The algorithm extends naturally to an online learning
   environment where it can be used to provide quick updates of the cost
   estimate as new data become available over time. For the online setting,
   we further develop an effective adaptive sampling strategy that guides
   the selection of the next samples. The efficacy of the proposed methods
   is demonstrated in computational experiments involving two applications:
   customer preference learning and cost estimation for production
   planning. The results show significant reductions in computation and
   sampling efforts.},

Abstract = {In earlier studies, it has been argued that drama has the potential to
   stimulate learning in science. However, it is not widely used, one
   reason being that science teachers are not familiar with this
   instructional strategy. In this study, it was investigated how
   pre-service teachers in science developed dramas related to content in a
   biology course. The research question included how the pre-service
   teachers reflected on drama as an instructional strategy to stimulate
   conceptual understanding about cells and cell processes, both for
   themselves and for their future students. Ten pre-service teachers
   participated, all in their first year of studies to become teachers at
   secondary school. Data were collected in the form of student reports and
   video-recordings, showing the dramas they had created served as
   complements confirming the reports. The reports were analysed based on
   the tool Content Representations. The results showed that despite the
   fact that the pre-service teachers previously had never experienced
   drama in their science education, and that they identified critical
   aspects of using drama in science, they were positive about using drama
   in science education. Some of the pre-service teachers also argued that
   the use of drama helped them in their own understanding of cell
   processes.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND Dental caries is the most common chronic illness for
   children. Caries can reduce the quality of life, cause missed classroom
   hours, and decrease cognition. Strategies to improve children's oral
   health must be evidence-based, developed, and implemented in
   consultation with communities. METHODS A community-academic partnership
   was formed between East Carolina University School of Dental Medicine
   and the Bertie County Public School District to develop and implement a
   school-based oral health prevention program using the PRECEDE-PROCEED
   Model. RESULTS The PRECEDE component involved social, epidemiological,
   environmental, educational, ecological, administrative, and policy
   factors that informed the development of the oral health program. The
   PROCEED component consisted of implementation and evaluation.
   CONCLUSIONS School-based oral health programs can increase access to
   care for vulnerable children and improve learning. The application of
   the PRECEDE-PROCEED model proved to be a valuable method for developing,
   implementing, and evaluating a school-based oral health program.},

Abstract = {This Guide discusses the considerable literature on the merits or
   shortcomings of Problem-based learning (PBL), and the factors that
   promote or inhibit it, when seen through the eyes of the student. It
   seems to be the case that PBL works best when students and faculty
   understand the various factors that influence learning and are aware of
   their roles; this Guide deals with each of the main issues in turn. One
   of the most important concepts to recognise is that students and Faculty
   share the responsibility for learning and there are several factors that
   can influence its success. They include student motivation for PBL and
   the various ways in which they respond to being immersed in the process.
   As faculty, we also need to consider the way in which the learning
   environment supports the students develop the habit of life-long
   learning, and the skills and attitudes that will help them become
   competent reflective practitioners. Each of these elements place
   responsibilities upon the student, but also upon the Faculty and
   learning community they are joining. Although all of the authors work in
   a European setting, where PBL is used extensively as a learning strategy
   in many medical schools, the lessons learned we suggest, apply more
   widely, and several of the important factors apply to any form of
   curriculum. This Guide follows on from a previous review in the AMEE
   Guides in Medical education series, which provided an overview of PBL
   and attempts to emphasise the key role that students have in mastering
   their subject through PBL. This should render the business of being a
   student a little less mystifying, and help faculty to see how they can
   help their students acquire the independence and mastery that they will
   need.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the characteristics of an initial training program for
   secondary school physics and chemistry teachers are presented. This
   program is based on the resolution of professional problems, in order to
   develop preservice teachers' competencies for integrating inquiry-based
   science education (IBSE) into their future teaching. With this goal in
   mind, the methodology of problem solving as an investigation was
   introduced, and preservice teachers had to solve a sequence of
   open-ended problems using this IBSE-type methodology. The article
   describes how they solved the practical problem ``What might happen when
   two substances are placed in contact with each other?{''} with a
   specific focus on the roles of both the students and the professor.
   Moreover, the paper provides guidelines for implementing the problem,
   which is compatible with the curricular content of secondary education.
   Finally, an analysis of preservice teachers' written reports about the
   problem suggests that the procedures which they found more difficult
   were those involved in the stages of ``design of resolution
   strategies{''} and ``analysis of results{''}.},

Abstract = {We conducted semistructured interviews to investigate the experience of
   two nonbinary students in an undergraduate chemistry program. Students
   described experiences with struggling with identity, hiding identity as
   a form of defense, discrimination by peers based on perceived gender,
   perceptions of unsympathetic instructors, and mental health struggles.
   They also identified the following factors that helped them succeed in
   their education: desire to learn, connecting with peers, and active
   support from mentors. Based on these findings, we recommend that
   instructors engage with topics outside of traditional course content,
   facilitate peer collaboration, acknowledge that there could be trans,
   nonbinary, and Two Spirit individuals in the classroom, and recognize
   that not all students are the same. Chemistry educators who implement
   these strategies will create a more respectful learning environment for
   trans, nonbinary, and Two Spirit students.},

Abstract = {The 2015 edition of the American Chemical Society's Guidelines and
   Evaluation Procedures for Bachelor's Degree Programs identifies six
   skill sets that undergraduate chemistry programs should instill in their
   students. In our roles as support staff for chemistry departments at two
   different institutions (one a Primarily Undergraduate Institution, the
   other a research-intensive university), we have been collaboratively
   studying these requirements and have found significant synergies between
   two in particular: ``Chemical Literature and Information Management
   Skills{''} and ``Laboratory Safety Skills{''}. We believe that by
   integrating emerging tools in the laboratory safety field into
   information literacy frameworks, a strong foundation can be established
   for the development of all the skills called out by the ACS. This
   article describes this strategy and provides examples of how these
   concepts can be implemented settings.},

Title = {Narrated Dissection Videos and Peer-Mentoring to Enhance Anatomy
   Performance of Underrepresented Minority Students in Physical Therapy
   Education},
Journal = {ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Three-dimensional virtual technology (3DVT) educational tools and
   peer-tutoring have proven to be effective teaching strategies in
   improving student learning outcomes. The purpose of this study was
   threefold: (1) compare the anatomy academic performance between
   underrepresented minority (URM) and non-minority (non-URM) students, (2)
   compare the voluntary use of 3DVT dissection videos and peer-mentoring
   between these two cohorts, and (3) estimate the association between the
   use of these teaching strategies on anatomy examinations and course
   grades at a school of physical therapy. Three-dimensional virtual
   technology narrated dissection videos and peer-mentoring were made
   available to all students. Time accessing the video and attending
   peer-mentoring sessions was measured throughout the course for all
   students. Three practical and four written examinations and the final
   course grade were calculated. Numerous one-way ANOVAs were used to
   compare examination/course grades between student cohorts (URM and
   non-URM) and usage of the two educational strategies (3DVT and
   peer-mentoring). Multiple linear regressions were performed with
   teaching strategies as predictors and grades as outcomes.
   Underrepresented minority students demonstrated significantly lower
   practical examination scores (P = 0.04), lower final course grades (P =
   0.01), and a greater use of mentorship hours (P = 0.001) compared to
   non-URM. The regression models with both predictors (3DVT and
   peer-mentoring) combined demonstrated the greatest association with
   grades for both URM and non-URM. For both groups of students, the
   association between predictors and practical examination scores,
   although fair, was not statistically significant. Peer-mentoring seems
   to be the most effective teaching strategy in helping URM students
   succeed in anatomy.},

Title = {Membership inference attacks against synthetic health data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {125},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising method to protect
   patient privacy while sharing individual-level health data. Intuitively,
   sharing synthetic data should reduce disclosure risks because no
   explicit linkage is retained between the synthetic records and the real
   data upon which it is based. However, the risks associated with
   synthetic data are still evolving, and what seems protected today may
   not be tomorrow. In this paper, we show that membership inference
   attacks, whereby an adversary infers if the data from certain target
   individuals (known to the adversary a priori) were relied upon by the
   synthetic data generation process, can be substantially enhanced through
   state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks, which calls into question
   the protective nature of existing synthetic data generators.
   Specifically, we formulate the membership inference problem from the
   perspective of the data holder, who aims to perform a disclosure risk
   assessment prior to sharing any health data. To support such an
   assessment, we introduce a framework for effective membership inference
   against synthetic health data without specific assumptions about the
   generative model or a welldefined data structure, leveraging the
   principles of contrastive representation learning. To illustrate the
   potential for such an attack, we conducted experiments against synthesis
   approaches using two datasets derived from several health data resources
   (Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the All of Us Research Program)
   to determine the upper bound of risk brought by an adversary who invokes
   an optimal strategy. The results indicate that partially synthetic data
   are vulnerable to membership inference at a very high rate. By contrast,
   fully synthetic data are only marginally susceptible and, in most cases,
   could be deemed sufficiently protected from membership inference.},

Abstract = {PlantingScience is an award-winning program recognized for its
   innovation and use of computer-supported scientist mentoring. Science
   learners work on inquiry-based experiments in their classrooms and
   communicate asynchronously with practicing plant scientist-mentors about
   the projects. The purpose of this study was to identify specific factors
   contributing to the program's effectiveness in engaging students. Using
   multiple data sources, grounded theory (Strauss and Corbin in Basics of
   qualitative research. Sage, Newbury Park, 1990) was used to develop a
   conceptual model identifying the central phenomenon, causal conditions,
   intervening conditions, strategies, contexts, and student outcomes of
   the project. Student motivation was determined to be the central
   phenomenon explaining the success of the program, with student
   empowerment, online mentor interaction, and authenticity of the
   scientific experiences serving as causal conditions. Teachers
   contributed to student motivation by giving students more freedom,
   challenging students to take projects deeper, encouraging, and
   scaffolding. Scientists contributed to student motivation by providing
   explanations, asking questions, encouraging, and offering themselves as
   partners in the inquiry process. Several positive student outcomes of
   the program were uncovered and included increased positivity, greater
   willingness to take projects deeper, better understanding of scientific
   concepts, and greater commitments to collaboration. The findings of this
   study provide relevant information on how to develop curriculum, use
   technology, and train practitioners and mentors to utilize strategies
   and actions that improve learners' motivation to engage in authentic
   science in the classroom.},

Abstract = {Context Code readability classification (which refers to classification
   of a piece of source code as either readable or unreadable) has
   attracted increasing concern in academia and industry. To construct
   accurate classification models, previous studies depended mainly upon
   handcrafted features. However, the manual feature engineering process is
   usually labor-intensive and can capture only partial information about
   the source code, which is likely to limit the model performance.
   Objective: To improve code readability classification, we propose the
   use of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets).
   Method: We first introduce a representation strategy (with different
   granularities) to transform source codes into integer matrices as the
   input to ConvNets. We then propose DeepCRM, a deep learning-based model
   for code readability classification. DeepCRM consists of three separate
   ConvNets with identical architectures that are trained on data
   preprocessed in different ways. We evaluate our approach against five
   state-of-the-art code readability models.
   Results: The experimental results show that DeepCRM can outperform
   previous approaches. The improvement in accuracy ranges from 2.4\% to
   17.2\%.
   Conclusions: By eliminating the need for manual feature engineering,
   DeepCRM provides a relatively improved performance, confirming the
   efficacy of deep learning techniques in the task of code readability
   classification.},

Abstract = {Through a modified team-based learning (TBL) in the anatomy
   pre-clerkship curriculum, formative evaluations are utilized in the
   University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine to assess and predict students'
   outcomes on summative examinations. The purpose of this study was to
   determine the efficiency of formative assessments to predict student's
   performance on summative examinations, during the first two semesters of
   medical school. Formative assessments included multiple-choice quizzes
   (MCQ) for each laboratory session and a practical midterm examination
   (MIDTERM), while the summative assessment corresponded to the final
   practical examination (FINAL). A moderate correlation between MCQs and
   FINAL (r=0.353 and 0.301, respectively), and strong correlation between
   MIDTERM and FINAL assessments (r=0.688 and 0.610, respectively) were
   found in the first two semesters. The MIDTERM-FINAL correlations were
   enhanced for students who scored under 61\% in the MIDTERM (r=0.887 and
   0.717, respectively). Despite limitations, mostly related to
   particularities of the used tests, the analysis revealed an efficient
   method to identify students at risk of failing the FINAL in a TBL-based
   anatomy program. Future developments include the elaboration of
   strategies to predict and support those underperforming students. Anat

Title = {Multiple tutorial-based assessments: a generalizability study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Background: Tutorial-based assessment commonly used in problem-based
   learning (PBL) is thought to provide information about students which is
   different from that gathered with traditional assessment strategies such
   as multiple-choice questions or short-answer questions. Although
   multiple-observations within units in an undergraduate medical education
   curriculum foster more reliable scores, that evaluation design is not
   always practically feasible. Thus, this study investigated the overall
   reliability of a tutorial-based program of assessment, namely the
   Tutotest-Lite.
   Methods: More specifically, scores from multiple units were used to
   profile clinical domains for the first two years of a system-based PBL
   curriculum.
   Results: G-Study analysis revealed an acceptable level of
   generalizability, with g-coefficients of 0.84 and 0.83 for Years 1 and
   2, respectively. Interestingly, D-Studies suggested that as few as five
   observations over one year would yield sufficiently reliable scores.
   Conclusions: Overall, the results from this study support the use of the
   Tutotest-Lite to judge clinical domains over different PBL units.},

Title = {The Educational Model of Private Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine:
   Revisited for 2003-2013},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {90},
Number = {12},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Trends in the development of new private colleges of osteopathic
   medicine (COMs) described by the author in 2003 have accelerated in the
   ensuing decade. During 2003 to 2013, 10 new COMs as well as 2 remote
   teaching sites and 4 new branch campuses at private institutions were
   accredited, leading to a 98\% increase in the number of students
   enrolled in private COMs. The key features of the private COM
   educational model during this period were a reliance on student tuition,
   the establishment of health professions education programs around the
   medical school, the expansion of class size, the creation of branch
   campuses and remote teaching sites, an environment that emphasizes
   teaching over research, and limited involvement in facilities providing
   clinical services to patients. There is institutional ownership of
   preclinical instruction, but clinical instruction occurs in affiliated
   hospitals and medical institutions where students are typically taught
   by volunteer and/or adjunct faculty. Between 2003 and 2013, this model
   attracted smaller universities and organizations, which implemented the
   strategies of established private COMs in initiating new private COMs,
   branch campuses, and remote teaching sites. The new COMs have introduced
   changes to the osteopathic profession and private COM model by expanding
   to new parts of the country and establishing the first for-profit
   medical school accredited in the United States in modern times. They
   have also increased pressure on the system of osteopathic graduate
   medical education, as the number of funded GME positions available to
   their graduates is less than the need.},

Title = {Learning from the implementation of clinical empathy training: an
   explorative qualitative study in search of the barriers and facilitators},

Abstract = {Background Amid concerns about the decline of empathy during the
   clinical training of medical clerks, evidence that empathy improves
   patient outcomes suggests some potential for teaching empathy in ways
   that will affect the knowledge, attitude and behaviour of medical
   clerks. This potential alone cannot, however, guarantee the success of
   educational innovations to introduce empathy to the medical curriculum.
   This research aims to identify the barriers and facilitators of the
   implementation of a specific clinical initiative to enhance the empathy
   skills of clerks, namely the training of clerks to act as a `MedGezel'
   or `medical coach'. Method We conducted an explorative qualitative study
   based on interview data collected and analyzed using reflexive thematic
   analysis and the readiness for change theory. We conducted
   semi-structured interviews with relevant stakeholders in this particular
   qualitative study. Thematic analysis was based on open and axial coding
   using ATLAS.ti 9, which facilitated the emergence of common themes of
   interest and meaning for the study. Results A total of 13 relevant
   stakeholders participated as interviewees in our study. The data was
   collected from April to June 2021. Our analysis generated 6 main themes
   which can provide insights into why the implementation of the MedGezel
   educational innovation failed so far. The following themes emerged: the
   case for change: why change?; practical necessity; leadership;
   management and resources; staff culture; and alignment with the
   corporate strategy. Discussion The implementation failure can be
   partially explained as resulting from the personal attitudes and choices
   of participants, who struggled to reconcile a vision that they liked
   with side effects that they feared. While participants repeatedly
   mentioned management and leadership issues, these organizational issues
   seemed less important as they could be easily resolved in practice. What
   was more important and fatal for the initiative was its lack of
   alignment with staff culture, despite its alignment with corporate
   strategy. Conclusion This investigation into the barriers and
   facilitators influencing the implementation of the MedGezel program
   identified 6 explanatory themes, the most impactful one being staff
   culture.},

Title = {Content counts, but context makes the difference in developing
   expertise: a qualitative study of how residents learn end of shift
   handoffs},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {NOV 3},
Abstract = {BackgroundHandoff education is both formal and informal and varies
   widely across medical school and residency training programs. Despite
   many efforts to improve clinical handoffs, little evidence has shown
   meaningful improvement. The objective of this study was to identify
   residents' perspectives and develop a deeper understanding on the
   necessary training to conduct safe and effective patient
   handoffs.MethodsA qualitative study focused on the analysis of cognitive
   task interviews targeting end-of-shift handoff experiences with 35
   residents from three geographically dispersed VA facilities. The
   interview data were analyzed using an iterative, consensus-based team
   approach. Researchers discussed and agreed on code definitions and
   corresponding case examples. Grounded theory was used to analyze the
   transcripts.ResultsAlthough some residents report receiving formal
   training in conducting handoffs (e.g., medical school coursework,
   resident boot camp/workshops, and handoff debriefing), many residents
   reported that they were only partially prepared for enacting them as
   interns. Experiential, practice-based learning (i.e., giving handoffs,
   covering night shift to match common issues to handoff content) was
   identified as the most suited and beneficial for delivering effective
   handoff training. Six skills were described as critical to learning
   effective handoffs: identifying pertinent information, providing
   anticipatory guidance, applying acquired clinical knowledge, being
   concise, incorporating delivery strategies, and appreciating the
   styles/preferences of handoff recipients.ConclusionsResidents identified
   the immersive performance and the experience of covering night shifts as
   the most important aspects of learning to execute effective handoffs.
   Formal education alone can miss the critical role of real-time
   sense-making throughout the process of handing off from one trainee to
   another. Interventions targeting senior resident mentoring and night
   shift could positively influence the cognitive and performance capacity
   for safe, effective handoffs.},

Abstract = {Ride comfort plays an important role in determining the public
   acceptance of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Many factors, such as road
   profile, driving speed, and suspension system, influence the ride
   comfort of AVs. This study proposes a hierarchical framework for
   improving ride comfort by integrating speed planning and suspension
   control in a vehicle-to-everything environment. Based on safe,
   comfortable, and efficient speed planning via dynamic programming, a
   deep reinforcement learning-based suspension control is proposed to
   adapt to the changing pavement conditions. Specifically, a deep
   deterministic policy gradient with external knowledge (EK-DDPG)
   algorithm is designed for the efficient self-adaptation of suspension
   control strategies. The external knowledge of action selection and value
   estimation from other AVs are combined into the loss functions of the
   DDPG algorithm. In numerical experiments, real-world pavements detected
   in 11 districts of Shanghai, China, are applied to verify the proposed
   method. Experimental results demonstrate that the EK-DDPG-based
   suspension control improves ride comfort on untrained rough pavements by
   27.95\% and 3.32\%, compared to a model predictive control (MPC)
   baseline and a DDPG baseline, respectively. Meanwhile, the EK-DDPG-based
   suspension control improves computational efficiency by 22.97\%,
   compared to the MPC baseline, and performs at the same level as the DDPD
   baseline. This study provides a generalized and computationally
   efficient approach for improving the ride comfort of AVs.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Our purpose was to investigate the effect of generalization of
   participation in parkour from physical education classes to organized
   parkour recess. Methods: A total of 143 (64 girls and 79 boys)
   third-grade elementary school children received a 12lesson parkour sport
   education season in physical education. Voluntary participation in five
   organized parkour recess sessions was investigated. Moderate to vigorous
   physical activity (MVPA) data in physical education, organized parkour
   recess, and traditional recess were collected. Results: Girls
   participated significantly more in organized parkour recess compared
   with boys (53\% vs. 35\%, p =.034). Boys achieved significantly higher
   MVPA than girls in physical education (47\% vs. 42\%, p =.045),
   organized parkour recess (73\% vs. 65\%, p =.003), and traditional
   recess (56\% vs. 36\%, p <.001). Children generated on average 22\% of
   MVPA through performing parkour-specific skills in organized parkour
   recess. Conclusion: Generalization of participation from physical
   education classes to organized recess programs is a promising strategy
   to increase children's daily MVPA.},

Abstract = {Medical Spanish (MS) education is in growing demand from U.S. medical
   students, providers, and health systems, but there are no standard
   recommendations for how to structure the curricula, evaluate programs,
   or assess provider performance or linguistic competence. This gap in
   medical education and assessment jeopardizes health care communication
   with Hispanic/Latino patients and poses significant quality and safety
   risks. The National Hispanic Health Foundation and University of
   Illinois College of Medicine convened a multidisciplinary expert panel
   in March 2018 to define national standards for the teaching and
   application of MS skills in patient-physician communication, establish
   curricular and competency guidelines for MS courses in medical schools,
   propose best practices for MS skill assessment and certification, and
   identify next steps needed for the implementation of the proposed
   national standards. Experts agreed on the following consensus
   recommendations: (1) create a Medical Spanish Taskforce to, among other
   things, define educational standards; (2) integrate MS educational
   initiatives with government-funded research and training efforts as a
   strategy to improve Hispanic/Latino health; (3) standardize core MS
   learner competencies; (4) propose a consensus core curricular structure
   for MS courses in medical schools; (5) assess MS learner skills through
   standardized patient encounters and develop a national certification
   exam; and (6) develop standardized evaluation and data collection
   processes for MS programs. MS education and assessment should be
   standardized and evaluated with a robust interinstitutional medical
   education research strategy that includes collaboration with
   multidisciplinary stakeholders to ensure linguistically appropriate care
   for the growing Spanish-speaking U.S. population.},

Abstract = {Portfolio optimization is one of the most important problems in the
   finance field. The traditional Markowitz mean-variance model is often
   unrealistic since it relies on the perfect market information. In this
   work, we propose a two-stage stochastic portfolio optimization model
   with a comprehensive set of real-world trading constraints to address
   this issue. Our model incorporates the market uncertainty in terms of
   future asset price scenarios based on asset return distributions
   stemming from the real market data. Compared with existing models, our
   model is more reliable since it encompasses real-world trading
   constraints and it adopts CVaR as the risk measure. Furthermore, our
   model is more practical because it could help investors to design their
   future investment strategies based on their future asset price
   expectations. In order to solve the proposed stochastic model, we
   develop a hybrid combinatorial approach, which integrates a hybrid
   algorithm and a linear programming (LP) solver for the problem with a
   large number of scenarios. The comparison of the computational results
   obtained with three different metaheuristic algorithms and with our
   hybrid approach shows the effectiveness of the latter. The superiority
   of our model is mainly embedded in solution quality. The results
   demonstrate that our model is capable of solving complex portfolio
   optimization problems with tremendous scenarios while maintaining high
   solution quality in a reasonable amount of time and it has outstanding
   practical investment implications, such as effective portfolio
   constructions.},

Abstract = {The R programming language and computing environment is a powerful and
   common platform used by life science researchers and educators for the
   analysis of big data. One of the benefits of using R in this context is
   its ability to visualize the results. Using R to generate visualizations
   has gained in popularity due to the increased number of R packages
   available to convert data to graphic display. In this paper, I ask the
   following question: how can student engagement with protein analysis be
   promoted using R-based visualizations in the classroom? During the 2021
   IUBMB/ASBMD workshop ``Teaching Science with Big Data{''}, I presented a
   teaching strategy that used R for the visualization of protein data. In
   this report, I provide a teaching procedure and a summary of how
   students engaged with these data in our Introduction to R for
   Professional Data Science class. This report is based on a case study
   methodology by reviewing student peer comments for protein analyses
   conducted in R. The results indicated that students were active
   participants in the peer-review process and that they learned to take a
   critical view of data visualization.},

Title = {Joint optimization of channel allocation and power control for cognitive
   radio networks with multiple constraints},
Journal = {WIRELESS NETWORKS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {26},

Abstract = {With the increasing demands for wireless communication, efficiently
   using the spectrum resource has always been an important research topic.
   In this paper, the problem of N pairs of Secondary Users (SU) sharing K
   available channels with M Primary Users and its associated problem of
   optimal channel allocation and power control are studied. To investigate
   a joint channel and power allocation for the underlay-based Cognitive
   Radio Networks, a sum-rate maximization problem of the SU with
   consideration of Quality of Service and the constraints of interference
   temperature and outage probability is formulated as a Mixed Integer
   Nonlinear Programming problem. To solve it, the objective function is
   divided into two sub-optimization problems: channel allocation and power
   control. First of all, we propose to use the Genetic Algorithm Channel
   Allocation algorithm (GACA) to solve the channel allocation optimization
   problem and get the optimal channel allocation strategy. The power
   control optimization is then followed, but the problem is a fractional
   form of function with coupling constraints that is non-convex and cannot
   be solved directly with convex optimization. To this end, when the SINR
   is sufficiently high, we obtain optimal power control strategy by
   introducing Geometric Programming and auxiliary variables to convert
   non-convex to Convex Geometric Programming. When SINR is the medium to
   low value, we use an iterative algorithm known as the Single
   Condensation Method to solve it. Finally, through our proposed iterative
   algorithm, that is, Joint Optimization Algorithm (JOA), the optimal
   solution is obtained. Moreover, the convergence and complexity of the
   algorithm are analyzed. The time complexity of JOA in the worst case is
   O(N-3 root N). In order to show the generality of the channel state, in
   the simulation part, we design a perfect CSI optimal solution scenario
   and a imperfect CSI suboptimal solution scenario. Simulation results
   show that the proposed algorithm can achieve better performance under
   different CSI states.},

Abstract = {Background Educational capacity building in pediatric ophthalmology is
   necessary to address the burden of childhood blindness in Ethiopia.
   Residency and fellowship training at Addis Ababa University (AAU) have
   been enhanced with support from the University of Toronto (UofT),
   following the established Toronto Addis Ababa Academic Collaboration
   (TAAAC). Our aim was to assess the feasibility of implementing a
   pediatric ophthalmology fellowship at AAU with support from UofT,
   modeled by successful postgraduate medical education within TAAAC.
   Methods A situational analysis, including a needs assessment, was
   conducted at Menelik II Hospital, Addis Ababa. Staff expertise,
   equipment and infrastructure were compared to International Council of
   Ophthalmology fellowship guidelines. Patient volumes were assessed
   through medical chart review. Local training needs were evaluated. A
   strategic working meeting facilitated program specification. Results The
   faculty consisted of 11 ophthalmologists, including 2 pediatric
   specialists. Fourteen thousand six hundred twenty-seven medical and
   three thousand six hundred forty-one surgical pediatric cases were seen
   in the previous year. A 2-year fellowship incorporating anterior
   segment, retinoblastoma, strabismus, and retinopathy of prematurity
   modules was developed. Research collaborations, didactic teaching, and
   surgical supervision were identified as priorities requiring support.
   Quality standard indicators included faculty feedback, case log review
   and formal examination. Telemedicine, development of a larger eye
   hospital and partnerships to support equipment maintenance were
   identified as strategies to manage implementation barriers. Conclusions
   The situational analysis provided a way forward for the development of a
   pediatric ophthalmology fellowship, the first of its kind in Eastern
   Africa. Learning outcomes are feasible given high patient volumes,
   qualified staff supervision and sufficient equipment. Strategic
   partnerships may ensure resource sustainability.},

Title = {Scaffolding to Support Problem-Solving Performance in a Bioengineering
   Lab-A Case Study},

Abstract = {Background: Engineering programs must equip students to solve open-ended
   workplace problems. However, the literature points to actual or
   potential difficulties faced by students in solving open-ended or
   complex problems. During Fall 2014, the authors' students experienced
   difficulties in solving open-ended bio-signals laboratory problems of
   designing input signals to analyze unknown systems via MATLAB
   programming. These difficulties resulted in low performance.
   Intended Outcomes: To support, or scaffold, problem-solving in
   subsequent semesters, a strategy of frequent and timely monitoring and
   feedback was used. The hypotheses were that these scaffolding strategies
   would be associated with enhanced performance on open-ended projects,
   and would support students in similar future work once removed.
   Application Design: Based upon strategies from the scaffolding
   literature, assignments that guided problem decomposition were used.
   Flipped instruction challenged students to prepare for the laboratory by
   reviewing worked programming examples and completing online assessments.
   The laboratory sessions were reserved for collaborative, hands-on
   programming, with instructor oversight, as in a problem-based learning
   environment. Students submitted frequent progress reports for
   self-monitoring and feedback throughout each project.
   Findings: A statistical comparison of project scores across semesters
   revealed performance improvements with scaffolding. Post-scaffolding
   assessment in a follow-up course determined scaffolding to be helpful
   and applicable by these students for similar projects. These preliminary
   results are important for STEM students and instructors encountering
   challenges with open-ended problem-solving of this nature, and they
   provide quantitative evidence recently called for by the STEM
   scaffolding literature.},

Abstract = {Medical reasoning describes a form of qualitative inquiry that examines
   the cognitive (thought) processes involved in making medical decision.
   In this field the goal for diagnostic reasoning is assessing causes of
   observed conditions in order to make informed choices about treatment.
   In order to design a diagnostic reasoning method we merge ideas from a
   hypothetic-deductive method and the Domino model. In this setting, we
   introduce the so called Hypothetic-Deductive-Domino (HD-D) algorithm. In
   addition, a multi-agent approach is presented, which takes advantage of
   the HD-D algorithm for illuminating different standpoints in a
   diagnostic reasoning and assessment process, and for reaching a
   well-founded conclusion. This multi-agent approach is based on the so
   called Observer and Validating agents. The Observer agents are supported
   by a deductive inference process and the Validating agents are supported
   by an abductive inference process. The knowledge bases of these agents
   are captured by a class of possibilistic logic programs. Hence, these
   agents are able to deal with qualitative information. The approach is
   illustrated by a real scenario from diagnosing dementia diseases.},
