abstract={It is possible to define Computational Thinking briefly as having the knowledge, skill and attitudes necessary to be able to use the computers in the solution of the life problems for production purposes. In this study, a scale has been developed for the purpose of determining the levels of computational thinking skills (CTS) of the students. CTS is a five-point likert type scale and consists of 29 items that could be collected under five factors. The study group of this work consists of 726 students educated at the levels of associate degree and undergraduate degree with formal education in Amasya University for the first application. For the second application 580 students who were educated in pedagogical formation education via distance education in Amasya University. The validity and reliability of the scale have been studied by conducting exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, item distinctiveness analyses, internal consistency coefficients and constancy analyses. As a result of the conducted analyses, it has been concluded that the scale is a valid and reliable measurement tool that could measure the computational thinking skills of the students. In addition; the digital age individuals are expected to have the computational thinking skill, and at what degree they have these skills, the revelation of whether the levels they have are sufficient or not are a requirement. Within this frame, it could be said that the scale could make significant contributions to the literature. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Although there is a growing interest in learning to program, the number of women involved in programming remains surprisingly low. We don't understand completely the causes but it has become clear that men and women have different perceptions of programming. The pedagogy of introductory programming courses should take these differences into account. In this study we analyze gender differences in an introductory programming course at the university level. Our results indicate that male and female students have different perceptions and learning outcomes: male students find programming easier, have a higher intention to program in the future and show higher learning outcomes than female students. To reduce these differences we have designed and implemented several learning modules using the principles of physical computing. The physical computing approach aims to take computational concepts out of the screen and into the real world so that students can interact with them. We have applied these modules in a MATLAB introductory programming course in a biology degree. When using these modules both male and female students showed similar results in perceptions and learning outcomes. The use of physical computing principles in combination with the traditional methodology reduced -actually closed- this gender gap. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The increasing fuel price has led to high operational cost and therefore, advanced optimal dispatch schemes need to be developed to reduce the operational cost while maintaining the stability of grid. This study applies an improved heuristic approach, the improved Artificial Bee Colony (IABC) to optimal power flow (OPF) problem in electric power grids. Although original ABC has provided robust solutions for a range of problems, such as the university timetabling, training neural networks and optimal distributed generation allocation, its poor exploitation often causes solutions to be trapped in local minima. Therefore, in order to adjust the exploitation and exploration of ABC, the IABC based on the orthogonal learning is proposed. Orthogonal learning is a strategy to predict the best combination of two solution vectors based on limited trials instead of exhaustive trials, and to conduct deep search in the solution space. To assess the proposed method, two fuel cost objective functions with high non-linearity and non-convexity are selected for the OPF problem. The proposed IABC is verified by IEEE-30 and 118 bus test systems. In all case studies, the IABC has shown to consistently achieve a lower cost with smaller deviation over multiple runs than other modern heuristic optimization techniques. For example, the quadratic fuel cost with valve effect found by IABC for 30 bus system is 919.567 $/hour, saving 4.2% of original cost, with 0.666 standard deviation. Therefore, IABC can efficiently generate high quality solutions to nonlinear, nonconvex and mixed integer problems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Dental X-ray image segmentation has an important role in practical dentistry and is widely used in the discovery of odontological diseases, tooth archeology and in automated dental identification systems. Enhancing the accuracy of dental segmentation is the main focus of researchers, involving various machine learning methods to be applied in order to gain the best performance. However, most of the currently used methods are facing problems of threshold, curve functions, choosing suitable parameters and detecting common boundaries among clusters. In this paper, we will present a new semi-supervised fuzzy clustering algorithm named as SSFC-FS based on Interactive Fuzzy Satisficing for the dental X-ray image segmentation problem. Firstly, features of a dental X-Ray image are modeled into a spatial objective function, which are then to be integrated into a new semi-supervised fuzzy clustering model. Secondly, the Interactive Fuzzy Satisficing method, which is considered as a useful tool to solve linear and nonlinear multi-objective problems in mixed fuzzy-stochastic environment, is applied to get the cluster centers and the membership matrix of the model. Thirdly, theoretically validation of the solutions including the convergence rate, bounds of parameters, and the comparison with solutions of other relevant methods is performed. Lastly, a new semi-supervised fuzzy clustering algorithm that uses an iterative strategy from the formulae of solutions is designed. This new algorithm was experimentally validated and compared with the relevant ones in terms of clustering quality on a real dataset including 56 dental X-ray images in the period 2014–2015 of Hanoi Medial University, Vietnam. The results revealed that the new algorithm has better clustering quality than other methods such as Fuzzy C-Means, Otsu, eSFCM, SSCMOO, FMMBIS and another version of SSFC-FS with the local Lagrange method named SSFC-SC. We also suggest the most appropriate values of parameters for the new algorithm. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Emotions are of great significance in education as in all areas of human life. It is acknowledged that, although the cultures of people, the environment where they live, and the language they use vary, emotions that are evaluated as universal do exist. In this study, we examined the changes in the emotions of 67 students during the lectures of Basic Information Technologies who studied in three different departments in a state university in Mediterranean region. The facial expressions of the students were analyzed and digitalized in terms of the feelings of disgust, sadness, happiness, fear, contempt, anger and surprise by means of a software developed through Microsoft Emotion Recognition API and C # programming language. During the lecture, we studied how student emotions varied and whether this change was statistically significant according to their departments, gender, lecture hours, the location of the computer in the classroom, lecture type and session information. The lesson plan consisted of three stages: introduction, activities and closure. The significance of the difference in emotions and the relationship between emotion change and achievement were examined according to three different stages. The research showed that feelings of contempt, anger, fear and confusion increased, while feelings of happiness, sadness and disgust decreased in the first stage of the lecture. It was determined that the feeling of happiness increased rapidly, whereas all other emotions decreased during the closure section of the lecture. We found that only the feeling of sadness displayed a significant difference according to the departments. It can be suggested that the equipment that provides instant feedback to the lecturer by monitoring the students' emotions automatically throughout the lecture can be made available throughout the educational institutions, thus contributing to the increase in the quality of education. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Early warning systems have been progressively implemented in higher education institutions to predict student performance. However, they usually fail at effectively integrating the many information sources available at universities to make more accurate and timely predictions, they often lack decision-making reasoning to motivate the reasons behind the predictions, and they are generally biased toward the general student body, ignoring the idiosyncrasies of underrepresented student populations (determined by socio-demographic factors such as race, gender, residency, or status as a freshmen, transfer, adult, or first-generation students) that traditionally have greater difficulties and performance gaps. This paper presents a multiview early warning system built with comprehensible Genetic Programming classification rules adapted to specifically target underrepresented and underperforming student populations. The system integrates many student information repositories using multiview learning to improve the accuracy and timing of the predictions. Three interfaces have been developed to provide personalized and aggregated comprehensible feedback to students, instructors, and staff to facilitate early intervention and student support. Experimental results, validated with statistical analysis, indicate that this multiview learning approach outperforms traditional classifiers. Learning outcomes will help instructors and policy-makers to deploy strategies to increase retention and improve academics. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Programming learning in college education is hard for students. Consequently, strategies are required to boost significant learning as well as sustained motivation during the delivery of the course. For this reason, the following investigation determines if the didactic strategy of gamification encourages engagement in a university level programming course. The article presents two interventions that took place during the period of January to April 2017 and January to April 2018 in a University of Mexico using the challenge-based gamification pedagogical strategy. This strategy supports the Werbach and Hunter methodology. The dynamics were emotional, social, and progressive and were conducted through challenge and opportunities mechanics. The components were points, badges, avatars, and a leaderboard. In both interventions, surveys were used to know the acceptance of the strategy on behalf of the students, and a meta-evaluation instrument was applied after the first intervention with the purpose of strengthening and improving the didactic strategy. The main conclusion of this work indicates that gamification in the classroom contributed to improve the engagement with the students to succeed in solving the challenges successfully; therefore, the pedagogical strategy under scrutiny can be applied to other subjects. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The aim of this study is to examine the effect of programming instruction with Scratch on student motivation and their programming achievements. The study group consisted of 52 sophomore students attending the Department of Computer Education and Instructional Technologies of Mehmet Akif Ersoy University's Faculty of Education, Turkey. Participants were randomly divided into two groups in order to have 26 students in both the test group and the control group. During the first seven weeks of the study, it is aimed that the students will understand programming logic and learn basic programming structures. For this purpose, participants in the test group were instructed using Scratch, whilst in the control group, flowcharting and problem-solving activities were conducted as per the curriculum. During the second seven weeks of the study, C# programming language instruction was conducted using the same method for both the test and control groups. Achievement Test and Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire were utilized as data collection tools in the study, and a 3 × 2 (measurement time x groups) factorial design was employed. Study findings revealed that programming achievement scores for both the test and control groups increased at the end of the whole process; however, the increase was significantly different in favor of the test group at the end of the whole process. It was observed that motivation scores decreased in the control group, while the test group's scores increased. © 2017},

abstract={Educational data mining is a growing field that uses the data obtained from educational information systems to discover knowledge and find answers to questions and problems concerning the education system. High dropout rates and poor academic performance among students are examples of the most common issues that affect the reputation of an educational institution. Students' academic records can be analyzed to explore the factors behind these phenomena. This paper discusses the building of a model to predict the performance of students in a programming course based on their grades in courses in other subjects. A classification based on an association rules algorithm is used to build a classifier to help evaluate the student's performance in the programming course. This model aims to reduce dropout levels by helping student predict their likelihood of success in a course before they enroll in it. In addition, course instructors will be able to enhance student performance in the course by better estimating their abilities to learn the subject matter and adjusting their teaching strategies and methods. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={This article describes the implementation of various core elements of Computational Thinking (CT) in the classrooms of schools of Latin America and USA in two specific courses: PC-01 and ECE130. These courses were designed for students of primary and secondary education, as well as for students of high school as part of a dual enrollment program with a local university. Both courses introduce the core concepts and processes of CT aided by the visual programming environments Scratch and Alice. The courses are facilitated by the classroom teacher with the support of a learning platform. This platform is configured to provide innovative pedagogical strategies based on emerging educational technologies. This article describes the concepts integrated under the term CT, and discusses the benefits of learning environments used to incorporate CT in the classroom. It describes as well the syllabi and assessments of both courses, and analyzes their impact of these courses on the educational institutions, the teachers and the students. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Computer programming is a subject that requires problem-solving strategies and involves a great number of programming logic activities which pose challenges for learners. Therefore, providing learning support and guidance is important. Collaborative learning is widely believed to be an effective teaching approach; it can enhance learners’ social interaction and offer a learning environment which provides rich learning experiences. However, the social interaction in collaborative learning does not occur automatically. Without proper guidance strategies or supporting tools for collaborative learning, the learning effects can be disappointing. To solve such a problem, a problem posing-based practicing strategy was proposed to support the development of a collaborative learning activity in a computer programming practice course. The students were guided to raise computer programming problems to boost the discussion among team members. The problems raised in each team were then exchanged and solved by another team to examine the coding and to provide feedback. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an experiment was conducted in a C# programming course. Two classes of students from a university participated in the experiment. One class with 25 students was randomly assigned as the experimental group, and learned with a collaborative learning activity using the problem posing-based practicing strategy; the other class with 28 students was the control group, which learned with a conventional collaborative learning activity. The results show that the proposed strategy benefited the students in terms of improving their learning achievement, in particular, their programming skills. Moreover, it was found that the students who learned with the proposed approach had higher self-efficacy and lower cognitive load than those who learned with the conventional collaborative learning approach. © 2017, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.},

abstract={In this paper we report the work that jeKnowledge (Júnior Empresa da Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologias da Universidade de Coimbra), a student-led initiative, has done in the ‘jeKnowledge academy’ courses to actively engage Portuguese high-school students in STEM education through hands-on projects based on the low-cost Arduino platform. F2F activities, based on a peer-assisted learning strategy, were complemented with tutorials and more advanced project suggestions in a blog. Pre and post surveys on students' attitudes towards programming and peer-coaching were administered to pre-university and first year college participants, finding an overall increase in the Likert scale for all the programming-related constructs under study (confidence, interest, gender, usefulness and professional) after the introductory course. As regards the peer-based learning approach, younger students seemed to be more eager to be taught in a less formal way than their older counterparts. The course resulted in high degrees of satisfaction for both the student tutors and their tutees. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: No treatment for COVID-19 is yet available; therefore, providing access to information about SARS-CoV-2, the transmission route of the virus, and ways to prevent the spread of infection is a critical sanitary measure worldwide. Serious games have advantages in the dissemination of reliable information during the pandemic; they can provide qualified content while offering interactivity to the user, and they have great reach over the internet. Objective: This study aimed to develop a serious game with the purpose of providing science-based information on the prevention of COVID-19 and personal care during the pandemic while assessing players’ knowledge about COVID-19–related topics. Methods: The study was conducted with the interdisciplinary collaboration of specialists in health sciences, computing, and design at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The health recommendations were grouped into six thematic blocks, presented in a quiz format. The software languages were based on the progressive web app development methodology with the Ionic framework, JavaScript, HTML5, cascading style sheets, and TypeScript (Angular). Open data reports of how users interact with the serious game were obtained using the Google Analytics application programming interface. The visual identity, logo, infographics, and icons were carefully developed by considering a selection of colors, typography, sounds, and images that are suitable for young audiences. Cards with cartoon characters were introduced at the end of each thematic topic to interact with the player, reinforcing their correct answers or alerting them to the need to learn more about the disease. The players’ performance was assessed by the rate of incorrect and correct answers and analyzed by linear correlation coefficient over 7 weeks. The agile SCRUM development methodology enabled quick and daily interactions of developers through a webchat and sequential team meetings. Results: The game “COVID-19–Did You Know?” was made available for free on a public university website on April 1, 2020. The game had been accessed 17,571 times as of September 2020. Dissemination actions such as reports on social media and television showed a temporal correspondence with the access number. The players’ error rate in the topic “Mask” showed a negative trend (r=–.83; P=.01) over the weeks of follow-up. The other topics showed no significant trend over the weeks. Conclusions: The gamification strategy for health education content on the theme of COVID-19 reached a young audience, which is considered to be a priority in the strategy of orientation toward social distancing. Specific educational reinforcement measures were proposed and implemented based on the players’ performance. The improvement in the users’ performance on the topic about the use of masks may reflect an increase in information about or adherence to mask use over time. © Juliano De Souza Gaspar, Eura Martins Lage, Fernando José Da Silva, Érico Mineiro, Isaias José Ramos De Oliveira, Igor Oliveira, Rayner Guilherme De Souza, Juan Rodrigues Oliveira Gusmão, Camila Fernanda Donadoni De Souza, Zilma Silveira Nogueira Reis.},

abstract={Programing is difficult for beginners because they need to learn the new language of computers. Developing software, especially complex software, is bound to result in problems, frustration, and the need to think in new ways. Identifying the learning behavior behind programing by way of empirical studies can help beginners learn more easily. In this study, a flipped classroom combined with the blended learning mode was adopted by switching the in-class instructional time and the out-of-class edX lecture time. The research laboratory developed a system that collected the teacher and students discussion activities when adopting problem-solving strategies in online discussion. The participants were 44 third-year college students from the computer science course of a university in northern Taiwan. The experiment was from 30th March to 4th May in 2015. A total of 120 initial comments were collected, along with 401 responding comments. These 521 comments were coded according to the problem-solving steps as posing questions, offering solutions, discussion, and sharing conclusions. The inter-rater reliability of the two coders reached a kappa value of 0.81. The results indicated that the flipped classroom combined with the problem-solving strategy was more effective than the previous problem-solving behavior sequence. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Contribution: This paper examined student effort and performance in an introductory programming course with respect to student-held implicit theories and self-efficacy. Background: Implicit theories and self-efficacy help in understanding academic success, which must be considered when developing effective learning strategies for programming.Research Questions: Are implicit theories of intelligence and programming, and programming-efficacy, related to each other and to student success in programming? Is it possible to predict student performance in a course using these constructs? Methodology: Two consecutive surveys ({N}=100 and {N}=81) were administered to non-CS engineering students in Işik University, Turkey. Findings: Implicit theories of programming-aptitude and programming-efficacy are interrelated and positively correlated with effort, performance, and previous failures in the course. Although it was not possible to predict student course grade the data confirms that students who believe in improvable programming aptitude have significantly higher programming efficacy, report more effort, and get higher course grades. In addition, failed students tend to associate the failure with fixed programming aptitude; repeating students favor fixed programming aptitude theory and have lower programming-efficacy, which increases the possibility of further failure. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The main purpose of the integration of network media and middle school ideological and political course is to better realize the moral education function of middle school ideological and political development. The use of resource integration technology to manage distributed teaching resources is conducive to improving the level of information construction in colleges and universities, and so on. This paper puts forward the integration system of ideological and political multimedia network teaching resources based on wireless network. Firstly, it presents an overview of the Radio Resource Management (RRM) problem and projected strategies within wireless network framework, where several Radio Access Technologies (RATs) are collectively controlled and identify the different activities relating to the CRRM issues. Secondly, this paper targets providing a summary of the RRM problem and projected solutions within wireless network. Thirdly, the theoretical elements of the design and the teaching resource management assessment process are clarified by using XML as the data exchange carrier to realize the automatic integration of teaching resources. Fourthly, we have used dSPACE platform, by calling its API function, which then call the subscribe function of dSPACE framework and store the subscription information in the database. Whenever new teaching resources enter the subscribed field, the dSPACE framework will automatically send e-mail to the subscribers. Finally, during the operation of the system, all functions operate normally and have strong security, so as to avoid the illegal theft or leakage of the data about the education system. © 2021 Liu Rong.},

abstract={Universities and educational institutions worldwide had to abruptly suspend their in-person classes and offer the rest of the term in an online format. This adjustment meant that instructors had to switch their instruction format and redesign their assessment strategies to ensure good quality education. In this work, we present the methods used in two courses for this transition and the impact on student learning. Specifically, we present data from two courses: Second-year engineering mathematics and first-year object-oriented programming. The online instruction was delivered covering all the objectives, and the online assessment environment was designed with all possible safeguards to maintain integrity. Our data from these assessments show that the measures were successful. Further, the data indicate that while the pandemic severely impacted the first-year students, the second-year students did not experience any learning issues in the transition. We also present the lessons learned for future improvement. © 2021 Kassel University Press GmbH. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In the 21st century, making daily innovations in software and hardware to facilitate the life process is the daily task of the community. This innovation also goes beyond the education field, various interventions were introduced by integrating technology to enhance the understanding and motivating of students in a subject. In view of this, we brought modernization into the learning of Computational Thinking (CT) in the form of a module that integrates mobile application development for the motivation of students in CT. In this module, students are taught to develop mobile applications using a visual programming language. This approach can be a catalyst for enhancing the motivation of students of the digital generation and the efficiency of learning. In motivation measurement, we used the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ), which consists of five domains of motivation, namely Intrinsic Goal, Extrinsic Goal, Task Value, Learning Beliefs Control and Self-Efficacy. This is divided into two groups, namely conventional and mobile applications for control and treatment groups. In treatment group consisted of 46 (51%) and the control group consisted of 45 (49%) respondents. All respondents of this study are students, studying in Institute A that offers similar courses which are Bachelor of Business Administration degree in collaboration with two different universities (University A and University B). © BEIESP.},

abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic is forcing schools, universities and learning and development professionals to shift rapidly from in-person to online learning. It made providing of an effective e-learning contents more important. Consequently, the development of e-learning products and provision of e-learning opportunities is one of the most rapidly expanding areas of education and training. The growth of e-learning application is accelerating through both offline and online system. These innovative systems are changing the face of learning as we know it. However, what is known about these innovative approaches for learning and training has been limited by the shortage of scientifically evaluation. This study aims to assess the impact of using interactive instructions on e-learning to improve effectiveness of a programming course. This study develops a questionnaire based on usability evaluation method for an e-learning system. The method extends the current practice by focusing not only on cognitive but also affective considerations that may influence e-learning usability. This paper presents findings from a study of the impact of the learning systems. The study also describes designing evaluation sheet, data collection and analysis strategies of a case study on the evaluation of the e-learning system implemented for Programming Course in Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University (APU), Japan. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={We survey the literature about the teaching and learning of recursive programming. After a short history of the advent of recursion in programming languages and its adoption by programmers, we present curricular approaches to recursion, including a review of textbooks and some programming methodology, as well as the functional and imperative paradigms and the distinction between control flow vs. data flow. We follow the researchers in stating the problem with base cases, noting the similarity with induction in mathematics, making concrete analogies for recursion, using games, visualizations, animations, multimedia environments, intelligent tutoring systems and visual programming. We cover the usage in schools of the Logo programming language and the associated theoretical didactics, including a brief overview of the constructivist and constructionist theories of learning; we also sketch the learners' mental models which have been identified so far, and non-classical remedial strategies, such as kinesthesis and syntonicity. We append an extensive and carefully collated bibliography, which we hope will facilitate new research. © 2014 Vilnius University.},

abstract={Abstract–Nolan and Temple Lang’s Computing in the Statistics Curricula (2010) advocated for a shift in statistical education to broadly include computing. In the time since, individuals with training in both computing and statistics have become increasingly employable in the burgeoning data science field. In response, universities have developed new courses and programs to meet the growing demand for data science education. To address this demand, we created Data Science in Practice, a large-enrollment undergraduate course. Here, we present our goals for teaching this course, including: (1) conceptualizing data science as creative problem solving, with a focus on project-based learning, (2) prioritizing practical application, teaching and using standardized tools and best practices, and (3) scaling education through coursework that enables hands-on and classroom learning in a large-enrollment course. Throughout this course we also emphasize social context and data ethics to best prepare students for the interdisciplinary and impactful nature of their work. We highlight creative problem solving and strategies for teaching automation-resilient skills, while providing students the opportunity to create a unique data science project that demonstrates their technical and creative capacities. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={This article presents the results of a study analyzing the influence of Service-Learning projects on the development and improvement of educational practices. A primary school classroom was used as the study's axis for investigation and the effects that were triggered during the project's implementation where the primary school teacher and students, the university professor and students and representatives of different institutions took part. The research methodology used was a case study and the strategies of collecting information were participant observation, semi-structured interviews and analysis of documents. The results have enabled us to demonstrate the effects of the pedagogical conceptions of the teacher, classroom curricular programming and professional development. Based on these findings, we conclude that Service-Learning opens new horizons for the design of innovative practices of social utility.},

abstract={More and more people take up learning how to program: in schools and universities, in large open online courses or by learning it by themselves. A large number of tools have been developed over the years to support learners with the difficult task of building programs. Many of these tools focus on the resulting program and not on the process: they fail to help the student to take the necessary steps towards the final program. We have developed a prototype of a programming tutor to help students with feedback and hints to progress towards a solution for an introductory imperative programming problem. We draw upon the ideas of a similar tutor for functional programming and translate these ideas to a different paradigm. Our tutor is based on model solutions from which a programming strategy is derived, capturing the different paths to these solutions. We allow for variation by expanding the strategy with alternatives and using program transformations. The instructor is able to adapt the behaviour of the tutor by annotating the model solutions. We show a tutoring session to demonstrate that a student can arrive at a solution by following the generated hints. We have found that we can recognise between 33% and 75% of student solutions to three programming exercises that are similar to a model solution, which we can increase by incorporating more variations. © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={This paper describes an interactive virtual laboratory for experimenting with an outdoor tubular photobioreactor (henceforth PBR for short). This virtual laboratory it makes possible to: (a) accurately reproduce the structure of a real plant (the PBR designed and built by the Department of Chemical Engineering of the University of Almería, Spain); (b) simulate a generic tubular PBR by changing the PBR geometry; (c) simulate the effects of changing different operating parameters such as the conditions of the culture (pH, biomass concentration, dissolved O2, inyected CO2, etc.); (d) simulate the PBR in its environmental context; it is possible to change the geographic location of the system or the solar irradiation profile; (e) apply different control strategies to adjust different variables such as the CO2 injection, culture circulation rate or culture temperature in order to maximize the biomass production; (f) simulate the harvesting. In this way, users can learn in an intuitive way how productivity is affected by any change in the design. It facilitates the learning of how to manipulate essential variables for microalgae growth to design an optimal PBR. The simulator has been developed with Easy Java Simulations, a freeware open-source tool developed in Java, specifically designed for the creation of interactive dynamic simulations. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Web 2.0 tools are expected to assist students to acquire knowledge effectively in their university environment. However, the lack of effort from lecturers in planning the learning process can make it difficult for the students to optimize their learning experiences. The aim of this paper is to integrate Web 2.0 tools with learning strategy in order to enhance the motivation of the students to use the Web 2.0 tools. The integration of the tools in learning a programing course is based on PQR strategy, which includes three components: Preview, Questions and Reflect. The study sample consisted of 39 undergraduate students for identifying their preference towards the use of Web 2.0 tools which include Blog, Youtube, Google Form and Padlet. The results show that the perception of students towards the use web 2.0 tools was positive. Hence, it was possible to integrate a learning strategy with specific Web 2.0 tools, and, thus, facilitate blended learning. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.},

abstract={In this paper, we aim to deter urban crime by recommending optimal police patrol strategies against opportunistic criminals in large scale urban problems. While previous work has tried to learn criminals' behavior from real world data and generate patrol strategies against opportunistic crimes, it cannot scale up to large-scale urban problems. Our first contribution is a game abstraction framework that can handle opportunistic crimes in large-scale urban areas. In this game abstraction framework, we model the interaction between officers and opportunistic criminals as a game with discrete targets. By merging similar targets, we obtain an abstract game with fewer total targets. We use real world data to learn and plan against opportunistic criminals in this abstract game, and then propagate the results of this abstract game back to the original game. Our second contribution is the layer-generating algorithm used to merge targets as described in the framework above. This algorithm applies a mixed integer linear program (MILP) to merge similar and geographically neighboring targets in the large scale problem. As our third contribution, we propose a planning algorithm that recommends a mixed strategy against opportunistic criminals. Finally, our fourth contribution is a heuristic propagation model to handle the problem of limited data we occasionally encounter in large-scale problems. As part of our collaboration with local police departments, we apply our model in two large scale urban problems: a university campus and a city. Our approach provides high prediction accuracy in the real datasets; furthermore, we project significant crime rate reduction using our planning strategy compared to current police strategy.

abstract={Combining work and study by students of Russian higher education institutions is studied from the viewpoint of how university quality and the set of financial, academic, social and demographic factors affect probability of student employment, and what motivates students to enter the labor market. The paper is based on the results of a 2013 survey among graduate students of Russian universities on their educational and career strategies conducted as part of the Monitoring of Education Markets and Organizations project. Data was analyzed using descriptive analysis and regression analysis: influence of factors was assessed through a logistic binary choice model (logit regression). It is shown that the most positive effect on probability of combining work and study is given by such factors as learning in a leading university, studying a Master's degree, specializing in areas of study connected with foreign languages, mathematics, computer programming, design, architecture, and culturology. Receiving no financial support from family, studying on a state-funded basis, and being male also increase probability of student employment significantly. The research performed has allowed to suggest hypothetically that combining work and study is most often caused by desire to gain work experience, with more talented students working more often, obviously. By doing so, students try to get to look more productive, which may later bring an economic profit to them in the labor market. These hypotheses require further examination.},

abstract={The paper presents effects of out-of-school teaching of computer science in a visual creative programming course (Scratch) for children aged 9–14, held at the Lodz University of Technology. The research was carrying out during 2016–2018 school years. The study sample consists of 265 primary and secondary students from Lodz Voivodeship (province) in central Poland. The results were obtained from anonymous questionnaires completed by 221 course participants and their parents. The answers confirm that this type of course becomes a new fascinating manner of spending spare time by children. Moreover, quantitative analysis of student's finals projects also has been performed. In the process of creative programming in the game-based environment, children develop the computational thinking skills, problem-solving strategies, and abstract thinking. Moreover, children are supported by their parents, who notice how important these competences are and how great opportunities they will present for children in future. Authors continue to grow Scratch programming course to democratize access to new technologies and education, preparing future generation for a world in which computational and algorithmic thinking is a central part of problem-solving. Perhaps some of the course participants will continue their study of programming and make it a career for their life. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Learning programming requires intensive effort and time to be allocated by students. Teaching programming needs careful selection of different supportive pedagogical methods to help students progress. When the teaching does not meet students' expectations, frustration occurs. Programming is usually introduced to Information Technology students in their first year of study. Different types of new students exist-some are prepared for university studies and others struggle. Students' engagement affects students' success or failure rates in programming. Only engaged students can allocate time on doing programming related activities. Engaged students who come to class with positive outlook are more likely to achieve better. Frustration can hinder the process of learning and it can occur when teaching methods don't appeal to students or when students don't receive timely feedback on their programming errors. From the literature, learning strategy, collaboration, self efficacy, time availability, interest, support, scaffolding, availability of devices and resources and comfort level were identified as the leading attributes that affect engagement in programming. Several IT solutions exist these days that could help in proving a quality learning experience and improve engagement such as education management system, adaptive systems and intelligent tutoring systems. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Algorithmic thinking and problem solving strategies are essential principles of computer science. Programming education should reflect this and emphasize different aspects of these principles rather than syntactical details of a concrete programming language. In this paper, we identify three major aspects of algorithmic thinking as objectives of our curricula: the notion of a formal language to express algorithms, abstraction and automation to transfer proven strategies to new instances, and the limits of practical computability. The primary contribution of this paper are three examples that illustrate how general aspects of algorithmic thinking can be incorporated into programming classes. The examples are taken from our teaching materials for K-12 and university non-majors and have been extensively tested in the field. © 2016 IOI, Vilnius University.},

abstract={Future school science standards, such as the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), emphasize the integration of simulation and modeling activities in the classroom environment. The extremes of these activities have two vastly different implementations. On one hand, a teacher can have students experiment on a pre-made simulation associated with the material. On the other hand, students can use, for example, an end-user programming tool to create the simulation from scratch. This allows students to not only experiment on, but also, to model the real world phenomenon being studied{ a key component of computational thinking. However, the greater amount of time necessary for student authoring of simulations can make such an approach infeasible in the classroom environment. This paper presents a spectrum of strategies for integrating simulations into classrooms emphasizing our research at the Scalable Game Design Lab, University of Colorado Boulder as well as research from other entities. Starting at consuming simulations and adding more user interaction and authoring elements begins to provide a gentle slope from consumption towards simulation creation. Results indicate that many of these strategies are quite effective.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Academic motivation is highly important in nursing education. Providing high-quality nursing care requires students who have motivation to acquire information and skills. However, nursing students lose their motivation gradually during their program. Thus, the present study is aimed at elaborating on the strategies to improve academic motivation in nursing students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted in Saveh University of Medical Sciences. The data were collected through focus groups and individual semi-structured interviews with forty nursing students, professors, and lecturers of nursing and midwifery school. The participants were selected through purposeful sampling method. This method is used for the selection of people who have had experience with or are part of the culture or phenomenon of interest. Data analysis was done as a continuous process through conventional qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The strategies to promote academic motivation of nursing students were categorized into four main categories including strategies pertinent to professors (empowering and motivating to improve the quality of teaching), strategies pertinent to students (creating positive attitude toward nursing, empowering, and encouraging academic achievement), strategies pertinent to clinical education (improvement of the quality of clinical training and optimization of the academic and clinical relationships), and strategies pertinent to faculty (providing extracurricular activities, proper curriculum programming, and educational and welfare facilities). CONCLUSIONS: The strategies to improve academic motivation are available in different areas including professors, students, faculty, and clinical education. In general, improving the quality of education and creating positive attitude in nursing students increase their academic motivation. © 2019 Journal of Education and Health Promotion | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.},

abstract={In the last few years, it has been pointed out that teaching programming is a strong strategy to develop pupils’ competences in computational thinking (CT). In the Portuguese context, the curriculum changes in 2018 made programming and CT compulsory for every pupil in primary and secondary education. Nowadays, there is an information and communication technology (ICT) subject, taught by a computer science teacher in each school grade. In Portugal, to become a computer science teacher in primary and secondary education, it is compulsory to have a master’s degree in computer science education. This article reports on a pedagogical activity developed with student-teachers of a Master in Teaching Informatics at the University of Lisbon. Within the activities of the master’s program, we developed a cross-analysis of the core characteristics of 26 block-based and visual programming applications (apps) used to teach computational thinking and programming in school classes. In order to organize the analysis, a framework with several dimensions was developed and used by student-teachers to register the characteristics of each app. The product of this work is a comparative matrix mapping the core characteristics of each of the 26 apps that student-teachers used to select the most appropriate one for teaching programming and computational thinking according to each grade, age group and other characteristics. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={First year programming-courses attract a diverse crowd of students. In the same course, we often get Computer Science (CS) and non-CS students who bring mixed-abilities and different learning needs to the classroom. Teaching the same material to all of these students present an interesting challenge to the instructor. This paper introduces a successful design of a CS1 programming course at the University of British Columbia-Okanagan. This design incorporated several teaching strategies, such as the partially-flipped classroom model and pair-programming, which were used to teach programming fundamentals by building animations and games using Processing, an open-source language that uses simplified Java syntax in a visually engaging environment. Initial results after applying the new design show improved class average grade, increased pass-rate, and higher student engagement and satisfaction. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={One of the biggest barriers to MOOC development is the large initial cost - sometimes exceeding $100,000 - and the possibility of never recovering that cost through course-related fees. This obstacle prevents many state universities and community colleges from creating their own MOOCs, denying faculty at those institutions the opportunity to help build MOOC content and to gain experience with this new teaching style. This paper presents a successful strategy for primarily undergraduate institutions to create their own MOOCs using local resources at relatively low cost. The authors discuss the development and implementation of Cal Poly Pomona's first MOOC, which was offered for 10 weeks during Spring 2014. The MOOC was an introduction to computer programming course and was open to everyone in the world for free. It was developed in stages over two years at a total cost of approximately $10,000 to the university. Significant savings were achieved by hosting the MOOC on a free platform (Blackboard CourseSites), repurposing existing materials from a hybrid course, hiring student assistants for video production, and utilizing undergraduate student volunteers to help on discussion boards. A total of 2119 participants enrolled in the course with 335 participants (16%) receiving a passing grade. Participants who were still actively engaged in the course by Week 2 had a much higher passing rate of 58%. Discussion boards and surveys provided feedback about the course format, participants' demographics, and participants' attitudes of the course. Most participants possessed at least a bachelor's degree, took the course primarily to enhance job-related skills, and were unaffiliated with the university. Participants' comments about the MOOC were overwhelmingly positive and the MOOC enhanced their attitudes toward the university and subject matter. Based on the success of this first offering, an expanded version of the MOOC will be offered during Spring 2015. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2015.},

abstract={Background and Objective: Operating Rooms (ORs) are among the most expensive services in hospitals. A challenge to optimize the OR efficiency is to improve the surgery scheduling task, which requires the estimation of surgical time duration. Surgeons or programming units (based on people's experience) typically do the duration estimation using an experience-based strategy, which may include some bias, such as overestimating the surgery time, increasing ORs' operational cost. Methods: This paper analyzes a machine learning-based solution for surgical time predictions. We apply and compare four machine-learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, Regression Trees, and Bagged Trees) to predict the surgical time duration at a tertiary referral university hospital in Bogotá, Colombia. Historical data from 2004 until 2019 was used to train the algorithms. Comparison among algorithms was given in terms of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the predicted surgery duration and the algorithms' computing time. The algorithm with the best performance was compared to the currently used experience-based method. Results: All the ML algorithms predict the surgery duration with an error between 26 and 37 min. The best overall performance was obtained using Bagged Trees (26 min RMSE, 3.16 min training time, 0.49 min testing time) when using a subset of the DB with the nine specialties containing 80% of the surgeries. Bagged Trees also outperformed the experience-based method with a lower RMSE; however, it also shifted from a predominant overestimation to underestimating surgeries' duration. Conclusions: Different ML algorithms for predicting the surgical time duration, showing and comparing their performance. Bagged Trees showed the best performance in terms of RMSE and computing time. Depending on the initial data, Bagged Trees outperformed the experience-based method, but future work is necessary to suit it, like any other ML algorithm, to the hospitals' needs. © 2021},

abstract={Massive open online courses (MOOCs) require registered learners to be autonomous in their learning. Nevertheless, prior research studies showed that many learners lack the necessary self-regulated learning (SRL) skills to succeed in MOOCs. This research study aimed to gain insights into the relationships that exist between SRL and background information from MOOC learners. To this end, a series of three MOOCs on computer programming offered through edX were used to collect self-reported data from learners using an adaptation of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire. Results show significant differences in general learning strategies and motivation by continent, prior computing experience and percentage of completed MOOCs. Men reported higher motivation than women, whereas pre-university learners needed further guidance to improve their learning strategies. © Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) are available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

abstract={Smart mobile devices have fostered new learning scenarios that demand sophisticated interfaces. Multimodal conversational agents have became a strong alternative to develop human-machine interfaces that provide a more engaging and human-like relationship between students and the system. The main developers of operating systems for such devices have provided application programming interfaces for developers to implement their own applications, including different solutions for developing graphical interfaces, sensor control and voice interaction. Despite the usefulness of such resources, there are no strategies defined for coupling the multimodal interface with the possibilities that these devices offer to enhance mobile educative apps with intelligent communicative capabilities and adaptation to the user needs. In this paper, we present a practical m-learning application that integrates features of Android application programming interfaces on a modular architecture that emphasizes interaction management and context-awareness to foster user-adaptively, robustness and maintainability. © 2016 Wiley Publishing Ltd},

abstract={The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of using Facebook on enriching the learning experiences of students in programming learning. In another word, the aim of the study is to detect the reflections from the environment of programming learning where Facebook is used. The study was carried out within the scope of the Introduction to Programming and Algorithm course taught in the software engineering department of the technology faculty of a university in Turkey. Initially, a Facebook group was created to enrich classroom teaching. Sixty-three freshman engineering students taking the course and the faculty members of the department joined the group. The study was conducted for one semester in the fall semester of the 2014–2015 academic year. The Educational Usage of Facebook Scale (EUFS) and semi-structured interview form were used as data collection tools in the study. Quantitative data were descriptively analyzed while qualitative data were subjected to content analysis. The results obtained in this study show that Facebook has positive effects such as providing a rich content in programming learning, increasing extracurricular communication, offering a cooperative and collaborative learning environment, increasing motivation, and bringing different perspectives as well as negative effects such as causing distraction, decreasing face-to-face communication, and bringing about problems about expressing oneself. As a result, it is possible to assert that Facebook can be efficiently used to support classroom teaching strategies and enrich learning experiences in programming learning. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract={This article analyzes literature on university-workplace partnerships and professional writing pedagogy to suggest best practices for workplace mentors to mentor new employees and their writing. The article suggests that new employees often experience cultural confusion due to (a) the transfer of education-based writing strategies and (b) the employees' lack of cultural knowledge of the new workplace. The article then outlines implied mentoring strategies based upon this transfer and lack of cultural knowledge. The article also analyzes the literature on discourse community theory, activity theory, service learning, and internships, each of which also imply potential mentoring practices. These comprehensive best practices are also contextualized through social cognitive, community-cultural, and motivational-attitudinal components that writing mentors should consider when mentoring writing in the workplace. © The Author(s) 2015.},

abstract={A valid diagnosis of migraine is a non-trivial decision problem. This is due to the fact that migraine can manifest wide range of varied symptoms. Thus, designing a computer aided diagnosis system for that problem remains still a very interesting topic. In this paper we present an ensemble classifier system designed for headache diagnosis. We assumed that the system should make fast initial diagnosis based on an analysis of data collected in the questionnaire only. Such an assumption eliminated possibility of application of most classical classification algorithms as they could not obtain decent level of accuracy. Therefore, we decided to apply an ensemble solution. Although it is clear that ensemble should consists of complementary classifiers, there is no guidance on how to choose ensemble size and ensure its diversity. Thus, we applied two stages strategy. Firstly, large pool of elementary classifiers were prepared. Its diversity was ensured by selecting algorithms of different types, structures, and learning algorithms. Secondly, we determined optimal size of the ensemble and selected its constituents using exhaustive search approaches. Results of experiments, which were carried on dataset collected in University of Novi Sad, shows that proposed system significantly outperformed all classical methods. Additionally we present analysis of diversity and accuracy correlation for tested systems. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={The traditional classroom teaching is monotonous based teaching techniques and it lacks interaction and students lose the curiosity to understand the purpose of studying the course. The learners anticipate new teaching techniques, digital assignment, and challenging assessment patterns. In higher education, various new teaching-learning process is introduced to engage the learners with motivations and kindle the practice of self-learning thereby paying the way for acquisition of better competency skills and knowledge. With the various innovations in ICT for higher-education, game based learning is one of the innovative teaching-learning strategies which gained interest in various universities. The paradigm shift of ICT is tangled with various teaching methodologies in-order to match the 21st- century learners. The game based learning for programming course stimulates the curiosity to learn and understand the programming concepts in a better way. It also suits all the types of learners in the classroom especially the slow learners. The purpose of choosing gaming as a teaching aid, the learners are so much interested and addicted to any form of gaming. Using this as opportunity and interest in higher education, the programming courses will surely yield better performances and motivate the learners for lifelong learning skills. This ongoing project is focused on developing game-based learning for programming courses for first-year undergraduate students of our university. All the first-year students of various departments undergo a Python programming language course during the first semester. This programming course delivers conventional classroom teaching with chalk/talk or powerpoint presentation equipped with a practical session for all the students in the laboratory. It is also embedded with game-based learning for few sessions. The topics from programming courses are developed as gaming platforms with stages and characters. This aids the students to acquire knowledge about a topic while playing games and interact with the gaming console. The gaming technology encourages the students to enhance their cognitive skills with coding and debugging skills, thereby enhancing their competency skills. The gaming technology binds the learners with motivation to enrich the performances and achieve the course learning outcome for the Python programming course. This gaming environment includes various levels with time durations and the scores acquired based on the completion of stages. The gaming phase includes activities like complete the code, drag and drop, debugging and guess the output. The learner's scores are evaluated using rubrics metrics which are defined by the course instructors based on the course objectives. The total scores acquired from all the stages are analyzed using learning analytics. The Artificial Neural network, regression techniques are used to measure the learner's performances and it is compared with the traditional teaching assessment process. This comparative study helps the academic curriculum to understand the impact of game-based learning for the Python course and the determination of the students to undergo such innovative teaching style in the classroom. © 2020 The Authors.

funding_text 1={In the recent past the general consensus on engineering education has changed from teacher centric to student centric approach. Importance on quantification of student exposure to digital equipment and educational software are given to have more comprehensive fluency in technology [1]. It is believed that the development of engineering education should begin with exposure to technologies as a necessary starting point. In order to achieve that, students should have sufficient exposure to a modern method of technical solution for real time problems. It enhances the capability of students and develop confidence. Such confidence increases their abilities to manipulate and work with such technology in the pursuit of other learning. It empowers the capability of demonstrating their skills in their work [2]. Moreover, engineering education has undergone a paradigm shift in the last decade. Academician and industry diplomats emphasize on making engineering education favourable to solve real life problems and create impact on society. Traditional teaching methodologies are not sufficient to take challenge of industries. As a consequence, the engineering education is expected to provide platform not only to improve technical skills but also to provide opportunities to acquire competence in team building, interaction, and interdisciplinary skills. In totality, every graduate should be industry ready and capable to face the challenges of real ow rld. The demand of toda‟y s is not only about the teaching methodology, it is also demanding a change in the engineering curriculum. The ABET Criteria 2000, that deals with accreditation requirements for engineering programs, strongly recommend that future curricula will be strongly influenced by these industrial demands. Simultaneously, the survey carried out International Technology and Engineering Educators Association engineering educators, with the support of National Science Foundation and National Research Council, reveals the need of industry collaboration with academic curriculum. Looking at the importance of the industry centric curriculum and toughness of courses, it is important to have a better teaching mechanism to make students eager and motivated to learn. Otherwise, such curriculum will be difficult to deliver.},

abstract={Gamification in higher education could be a bad strategy if you only consider creating a game environment for learning, but particularly for a programming course can represent the element of motivation to develop specific skills. This article presents a pilot learning environment using gamification, for which emotional, social, narrative and progress dynamics were applied. The mechanics consisted of challenges and opportunities, where some of components were badges and a leadership board. The educational strategy was applied during period January–April 2017 in Programming course at Technological University of Puebla-Mexico; through surveys, students’ acceptance of intervention was questioned and academic results of experimental group were compared with those obtained in the last 8 years with students from previous courses. The main conclusion of the work indicates that intervention of proposal in classroom offered necessary motivation to students for achievement of challenges and can be applied to other subjects. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The goal of the SimProgramming approach is to help students overcome their learning difficulties in the transition from entry-level to advanced computer programming, developing an appropriate set of learning strategies. We implemented it at the University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro (Portugal), in two courses (PM3 and PM4) of the bachelor programmes in Informatics Engineering and ICT. We conducted semi-structured interviews with students (n=38) at the end of the courses, to identify the students' strategies for self-regulation of learning in the assignment. We found that students changed some of their strategies from one course edition to the following one and that changes are related to the SimProgramming approach. We believe that changes to the educational approach were appropriate to support the assignment goals. We recommend applying the SimProgramming approach in other educational contexts, to improve educational practices by including techniques to help students in their learning. © 2018 Production.},

abstract={Purpose: Testing is one of the indispensable activities in software development and is being adopted as an independent course by software engineering (SE) departments at universities worldwide. The purpose of this paper is to carry out an investigation of the performance of learners about testing, given the tendencies in the industry and motivation caused by the unavailability of similar studies in software testing field. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on the data collected over three years (between 2012 and 2014) from students taking the software testing course. The course is included in the second year of undergraduate curriculum for the bachelor of engineering (SE). Findings: It has been observed that, from the performance perspective, automated testing outperforms structural and functional testing techniques, and that a strong correlation exists among these three approaches. Moreover, a strong programming background does help toward further success in structural and automated testing, but has no effect on functional testing. The results of different teaching styles within the course are also presented together with an analysis exploring the relationship between students’ gender and success in the software testing course, revealing that there is no difference in terms of performance between male and female students in the course. Moreover, it is advisable to introduce teaching concepts one at a time because students find it difficult to grasp the ideas otherwise. Research limitations/implications: These findings are based on the analysis conducted using three years of data collected while teaching a course in testing. Obviously, there are some limitations to this study. For example, student’s strength in programming is calculated using the score of C programming courses taken in previous year/semester. Such scores may not reflect their current level of programming knowledge. Furthermore, attempt was made to ensure that the exercises given for different testing techniques have similar difficulty level to guarantee that the difference in success between these testing techniques is due to the inherent complexity of the technique itself and not because of different exercises. Still, there is small probability that a certain degree of change in success may be due to the difference in the difficulty levels of the exercises. As such, it is obviously premature to consider the present results as final since there is a lack of similar type of studies, with which the authors can compare the results. Therefore, more work needs to be done in different settings to draw sound conclusions in this respect. Originality/value: Although there are few studies (see e.g. Chan et al., 2005; Garousi and Zhi, 2013; Ng et al., 2004) exploring the preference of testers over distinct software testing techniques in the industry, there appears to be no paper comparing the preferences and performances of learners in terms of different testing techniques. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Challenges particular to second-year students have been identified that can impact persistence in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. We implemented a program to improve student success in intermediate-level science courses by helping students to feel they belonged and could succeed in STEM. We used survey measures of perceptions and attitudes and then qualitative measures to characterize the impact of support strategies, including peer mentoring, a second-year science student retreat, learning and advising support resources, and department-specific activities. Analysis of registration and transcript information revealed underperformance by students of color (SOC) and first-generation (FG) students in 200-level science courses. Comparison of these data before and during programming revealed significant improvement in success rates of these students in 200-level biology and chemistry courses, but success rates of SOC and FG students remain lower than the overall rate for 200-level science courses. Contemporaneous with the program, qualitative and quantitative measures of student attitudes revealed a high level of belongingness and support. The results suggest that a focus on students’ metacognition about their own abilities and strategic knowledge of how to succeed may be a fruitful direction for future research. © 2016 L.

abstract={It is highly recognized that difficulties involved in teaching programming in an introductory course, arise from the cognitive process complexity that is necessary for developing this ability. Previous studies on the best first programming language or the best first programming paradigm have been conducted. Even, the most appropriate integrated development environment (IDE) for novice programmers has been inquired, and the most appropriate problem solving strategy to teach to write computable solutions has been researched. From the investigation in a sample of Bogota universities, and from a holistic perspective, this paper presents an overview of the most common practices and difficulties in teaching these courses, providing important information to help diagnose possible weaknesses in the current process of teaching as well as providing some elements to consider in the design of new strategies, resources and planning criteria for these formative scenarios. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={It seems that education is working fine, especially in several good and traditional Universities around the world. Nokia was also doing very well in a business world until clients' needs change. Are we academics really offering what the students and the labor market need and demand? We have offered the same product for decades, but we haven't realize that the client is different and is demanding another product. Sometimes, we may have the feeling that our students are beyond this world when they are connected in the internet. Some say that the new generation is not using technology in a properly way to study; however are academics using it better? We are not using the new generation's language to communicate with students and to transfer knowledge. Games and competitions is the 'language of the new generation' and it may promote a desired long-term learning experience we academics always wished. This paper describes the use of gamification as a tool to support the lectures of concurrent and distributed subjects, for undergraduate students of computer science course. In the game students should create and optimize the production line of a specific product. In the programming class, students should create and balance the same production line to beat competitors. Students have to use concepts of distributed programming and concurrency, and create strategies to organize the threads (production line) in order to be more efficient than the other competitors. The best production lines sell more and get more benefits. This paper discusses the preliminary results obtained from a survey of learning inhibits, which were applied before and after doing the course activity. The study compares the results obtained in both surveys and indicate that with the use of gamification to support class activities the learning inhibits tend to reduce at same time that transversal competences are stimulate on students. The discussion conducted after each round of the game indicated the interest and motivation of the students with this type of class. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Aim/Purpose This paper presented the framework for the integration of digital technolo-gies in education, implemented in InTecEdu Program, developed by Remote Experimentation Laboratory (RExLab), Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), Brazil. Background The main objective of the model presented is to arouse interest in science and technology among adolescents. Therefore, it sought to develop STEM competencies (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) in chil-dren and adolescents. Understanding learning in STAM areas can favor the development of professionals who can supply the demand in related sectors, especially in the scientific-technological scope. To fulfill the main objective, strategies related to students and teachers were developed. With activities aimed at students, it was hoped to promote vocations to scientific-technolog-ical careers and encourage entrepreneurship. On the other hand, the activities related to teachers aimed at training them to integrate technology into their lesson plans. Inspired by the Maker Culture, the model sought to make it possible for teachers to become the main agents in the process of integrating technology in their lesson plans, since they were in charge of building and producing their digital content and other resources to support their didactic activities. The maker movement is a technological extension of the "Do It Yourself!" culture, which encourages ordinary people to build, modify, repair, and manufacture their objects, with their own hands. The training actions were preceded by a diagnosis, inspired by the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) model, as well as the lesson plans prepared and made available by the teachers. Methodology Methodologically, the framework's work plan was composed of five Work Packages (WP), which include management, resource mapping, strategies re-lated to teachers, strategies related to students, and the dissemination and ex-ploitation of results. In the 2014-2018 period, 367 teachers participated in training activities, intending to integrate technologies into lesson plans. At the end of 2018, 27 Basic Education schools, including an indigenous and a rural school, from the public-school system, in the states of Santa Catarina, Minas Gerais, and the Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil, using the project's Vir-tual Learning Environment (VLE). In these 70 teachers, 230 classes, and 6,766 students accessed didactic content, produced by teachers, at VLE. Also, 20 laboratories were available in 26 instances, for use in practical activi-ties in disciplines in the STEM areas. Specifically, in the STEM areas, 3,360 students from 98 classes from 9 schools had integrated the Remote Labora-tories, in lesson plans in the subjects of Physics and Biology (High School), Science (Elementary School). Contribution The main results of the application of the framework are related to the train-ing of human resources, knowledge production, and educational innovation. About the training of human resources, we sought to contribute to the train-ing of teachers concerning technology in education and, with that, arouse greater interest on the part of students, as well as obtain improvements in their learning from teaching methodologies supported on the use of digital technologies. On the other hand, the production of knowledge, in the pro-gram and the socialization of research, is favored by the model based on open-source resources, both in terms of software and hardware and with open educational resources. This characteristic favor and expands the poten-tial for reapplying research and, consequently, its contribution to educational innovation. Findings The results, about students, indicated an increase in motivation due to the creation of new teaching and learning opportunities. The fact of extending the classroom and school, through remote laboratories, to support practical activities and the use of VLE, was also pointed out as a very positive factor. On the other hand, the realization of the workshops, inspired by practices of the Maker Culture, provided an approximation of these to the skills of the real world, which will certainly favor their employability. Regarding the teach-ers, it is noticed the continuity and expansion in the use of technological re-sources in the classroom; many sought and have participated in new training actions. Recommendations for Practitioners Provision of a repository of practices for sharing and reuse of lesson plans developed by teachers participating in the research. Technical documents, manuals, and guides for robotics, computer programming, electronics and new technology workshops for students. Recommendations for Researchers Technical documents, manuals, and guides for remote laboratories. Data col-lected in the applied questionnaires. Technical documents, manuals, and guides for robotics, computer programming, electronics and new technology workshops for students. Impact on Society The main results of the framework application are related to human re-sources formation, knowledge production, and educational innovation. Re-garding the formation of human resources, we sought to contribute to the formation of teachers concerning technology in education and, about the stu-dents the creation of teaching and learning opportunities, to extend the class-room and also the school, through the remote laboratories, to support the practical activities and the use of the VLE. Future Research The socialization and reapplication of the framework since it is based on open-source resources, both software and hardware, and with open educa-tional resources. © 2020, Informing Science Institute.},

abstract={To address contemporary difficulties, global designers must be prepared in cutting edge learning conditions, aptitudes and expert information. Upheld by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Build-IT program (Building University Learning, Industry, and Development through Innovation and Technology) expands on the wide capacities of the executing accomplice from ASU and assumes a key function as a pioneer chief. In gathering characters from different fields. An all around prepared designer can add to the economical advancement of a general public. So as to make a network focused training, an incorporated technique has been proposed in which an issue based learning strategy is investigated to apply specialized information. In accordance with this methodology, in the way we are proposing, mechatronics designing understudies originally needed to work with different understudies in the fields of hardware, programming, control mechanization, and mechanics, and afterward planned an open, interdisciplinary, incorporated educational program. By working together with peers in building up this hardware, understudies are better outfitted with explicit information. This cycle additionally causes understudies to feel certain about applying their imaginative thoughts while protecting the essential significance of the apparatus. A significant advantage of this methodology is that helping understudies defeat their issues all the while upgrades the specialist's activity in the public arena, in spite of losing a portion of the particular range of abilities. The current methodology, in view of exact investigations utilizing this open structure, shows that understudies in our program have adequate abilities to add to social accomplishments. At long last, the useful, ease, and instructive visual device made by the members shows the estimation of this multidisciplinary approach. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The conventional education system lacks the focus to create employable graduates. The existing industries in the Information Technology sector widely recruit based on a very specific set of skills and academic performances. To create better career opportunities, the colleges and universities should ensure that the graduates are qualified to accomplish the basic skills required by any organizations. This demands systematic approaches to be adopted with an innovative teaching style during the academic curriculum-based training in engineering colleges. The international accreditation organization ABET is a worldwide recognized educational board that provides streamlined guidelines for competency skills and to deliver a quality education for students. In this research work, an extensive study has been performed on the needs of the industry and it has been compared to the quality of the course being offered to the students. The curriculum is designed based on the industry experts' feedback. To achieve the Student Outcome Criteria as per ABET accreditation, the practices of structured approach is adopted along with the vision of lifelong learning in this research work. The teaching-learning process of first year under-graduate programming course and its evaluation techniques is considered in this research work. The competency skills like problem solving skills, critical thinking, and creative thinking are analysed using learning analytics strategies for first year Python programming course. The performances of the students are broadly categorized based on the metrics like logical, conceptual, analytical and conceptual thinking, while simultaneously focusing on their time management skills and commitment to learn. Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Naive Bayesian algorithm and logistic regression models are used to identify and measure the competency skills of the learners achieved in this course and validating these metrics with the student learning outcome. Implementing Artificial Intelligence concepts will provide results that can aid in creating the most suitable teaching-learning environment resulting in the best outcome for disruptive engineering education. Learning Analytics will provide an understanding and optimization of learning and its environments thereby ensuring sustainable development. This analysis presents an opportunity to identify the gap between the academic curriculum and the industry's expectations in terms of competency skills to be acquired by the learners. Additionally, it helps to improve the teaching-learning process according to the dynamic changes from the industries and builds the foundation for students to be lifelong learners. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Environmental education is intended to increase public awareness and knowledge about environmental issues and enhance individuals’ problem-solving and decision-making skills by tackling problems in the real world. “Maker education,” on the contrary, mostly relies on “problem-based” and “project-based learning” approaches with hands-on activities and collaborative learning experiences to engage students in solving authentic problems. The current study proposes an innovative curriculum design to integrate maker-centered learning with environmental thematic teaching. It then develops a series of project-based maker-centered learning activities aspiring to lead students to cultivate their creative problem solving (CPS) abilities in dealing with the environmental issues they encounter in their daily life. The developed information platform enables learners to access class materials and techniques, including 3D modeling, printing, and programming, to provide and nurture learners’ CPS abilities, and facilitates their information-, product-, and resource sharing. This study adopted a quasi-experimental design, and the developed curriculum was implemented in the teaching of two classes of a university in Taiwan (N = 73). Multiple scales were developed and applied to measure maker self-efficacy and environmental attitude to determine students’ learning outcomes. In conclusion, the study provided empirical evidence of how to design an effective maker-centered environmental curriculum to cultivate environmental awareness and attitude. Also, it provides a framework, a “comprehensive maker education model,” to develop better teaching and learning strategies and improve the effectiveness of a maker curriculum in higher education. © 2019, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe the process of fostering a maker culture in a liberal arts university. It explores the impact of making on student learning and engagement, as well as the role of the library’s maker program. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a case study that presents the tools and activities used in an academic library’s maker program. Structured interviews were conducted with faculty, staff and students to review the program and maker culture influence on campus. Findings: Findings highlight the library’s role in supporting maker culture on a liberal arts campus and address ways making contributes to student engagement and learning. Interviewees also recommend strategies to increase awareness and market the library’s maker program to engage a wider community. Originality/value: Though there are many articles written about the maker movement and libraries, this study contributes to the growing body of research on makerspaces in higher education, with particular focus on a library at a liberal arts university. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Automation engineering departments must continuously develop their laboratories and pedagogical tools to provide their students with effective study plans. While acquiring state-of-the-art equipment can be financially demanding, an effort is made at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim to provide the students with a hands-on sustainable experience. A strategy that consists of adopting low-cost commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components for learning purposes is selected. This combines both industry-standard automation controllers, such as Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) technology, as well as novel microcontrollers designed for use in embedded systems education. Specifically, the micro: bit microcontroller based on the nRF51822 system-on-chip (SoC) and designed by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is adopted. This choice is supported by an agreement between NTNU and the Norwegian company Nordic Semiconductor, which produces the nRF51822 SoC. This paper proposes a novel organisation of the embedded systems module for the engineering cybernetics education curriculum. Students are engaged in both a series of theoretical lectures as well as practical and highly-involving laboratory group projects. The course organisation and main topics as well as result analysis of student surveys are discussed. The survey results indicate that the course organisation and topics are effective for the students. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Virtual education raises to students and teachers important challenges, normally different to those faced in conventional education. In the context of virtual education, a question that remains to be solved is associated with the level of motivation possessed by the students during the course. Usually, at the School of Engineering in the University of Medellín, this issue is tackled through activities such as chats and forums. Mostly, these activities are not enough to motivate the student in the activities related with the learning process. This work proposes two motivation strategies based on gamification and constructivism. These strategies are validated in a course called programming fundamentals, taught to all bachelor degrees given in the School of Engineering. Results obtained through the experiments suggest that proposed strategies improve the students performance and satisfaction in the course. Therefore, when teaching at the virtual scenario, using Information and Communication Technologies in the educational environment is not only the way to contact the student, it is the mean to develop pedagogical-didactic approaches that finally enrich the educational process and consequently motivate the student to perform well. © 2003-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The tech sector has been growing at a rapid speed, demanding a higher level of expertise from its labor force. New skills and programming languages are introduced and required by the industry every day, while the university courses are not updated adequately. Finding the high-demand skills and relevant courses to study has become essential to both students and faculty members at tech universities, which leads to a growing research interest in building an intelligence system to support decision making. Leveraging recent development in Natural Language Processing, we built an NLP-based course recommendation system specifically for the computer science (CS) and information technology (IT) fields. In particular, we built (1) a Named Entity Recognition (CSIT-NER) model to extract tech-related skills and entities, then used these skills to build (2) a personalized multi-level course recommendation system using a hybrid model (hybrid CSIT-CRS). Our CSIT-NER model, trained and fine-tuned on a large corpus of text extracted from StackOverflow and GitHub, can accurately extract the relevant skills and entities, outperforming state-of-the-art models across all evaluation metrics. Our hybrid CSIT-CRS can provide recommendations on multiple individualized levels of university courses, career paths with job listings, and industry-required with suitable online courses. The whole system received good ratings and feedback from users from our survey with 201 volunteers who are students and faculty members of tech universities in Australia and Vietnam. This research is beneficial to students, faculty members, universities in CS/IT higher education sector, and stakeholders in tech-related industries. © 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract={Teaching computer programming is a real challenge in the State University of Milagro (UNEMI), located in one of the least-developed zones in Ecuador, a non-WEIRD country (WEIRD stands for Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic). Despite the application of various learning strategies, the historical pass rate does not exceed 43%. To solve this problem, we have relied on visual programming languages, specifically Scratch. Scratch is an open source software to learn programming that has a strong assumption of the benefits of community work. A quasi-experiment conducted with 74 undergraduate students during the first semester of CS showed that: (1) Both groups (control and experimental) are homogeneous in terms of their demographic characteristics, previous academic performance and motivation (expectations) concerning the course; (2) Scratch is strongly accepted by students in the experimental group and concerning the learning process, both groups showed similar levels of satisfaction; (3) the experimental group showed a pass rate four times higher than the control group; (4) in general, student success is associated with having learned programming with Scratch. While limited, our results are an important step in our road to improve the learning of programming in a low social status area of Ecuador. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={—Teaching and learning how to program are not easy tasks. Disapproval and dropout rates are a concern for everyone concerned with the topic. Therefore, it is necessary to look for strategies that improve the motivation of students who start a programming course, also improving success rates and decreasing dropout rates. The inverted class model, or flipped classroom, has been used in several experiments, showing very good results. The objectives of this teaching-learning technique is to change the traditional order: students have contact with new subjects before the classroom, using videos, texts or other material, as well as small online tests to check their knowledge. In this way, the face-to-face classes are reserved for discussion, doubts and application of previously acquired knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the scientific production on Flipped classrooms in introductory programming courses indexed in Elsevier’s Scopus. The sample is composed by 45 articles in total. The results obtained by bibliometric analysis showed when and where those documents are published, who are the authors and what is the focus of said articles. We also analyzed the most cited documents. We made a summary of the articles, namely in what refers to the sample size of the experiences, which programming language is used, in which universities the articles are made, which technology is used, as well as which methods are used in order to create inverted classes and which are the objectives and results of these experiences reported on the articles.. We managed to get a global view of the theme, getting a strong analysis for those who want to use flipped classrooms for teaching programming. © 2021 by the authors.},

abstract={How to design efficient scheduling strategy for different environments is a hot topic in cloud computing. In the private cloud of computer science labs in universities, there are several kinds of tasks with different resource requirements, constraints, and lifecycles such as IT infrastructure tasks, course design tasks submitted by undergraduate students, deep learning tasks and and so forth. Taking the actual needs of our laboratory as an instance, these tasks are analyzed, and scheduled respectively by different scheduling strategies. The Batch Scheduler is designed to process tasks in rush time to improve system throughput. Dynamic scheduling algorithm is proposed to tackle long-term lifecycle tasks such as deep learning tasks which are hungry for GPU resources and have dynamically changing priorities. Experiments show that the scheduling strategies proposed in this paper improve resource utilization and efficiency. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Currently, teachers must know that each student learns according to their own motivations, their degree of cognitive-academic development and their learning style, which allows them to achieve high levels of learning. This research analyzes the strategies to enhance learning and its relationship with the academic performance of first-year undergraduate surgeon students at a public university in Mexico. From a methodological perspective, quasi-experimental research in first semester students of the Faculty of Medicine of the Autonomous University of Tamaulipas in Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico (N = 194), uses the Neurolinguistic Programming test of Blander and Grinder with 40 items of three response options to identify the preferred perception channel and the statistical analysis in SPSS 19.0 calculating the reliability of the instrument through the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. The results indicate that the kinesthetic learning style predominates in the students who were part of the study (58.2%), observing a relationship between learning style and academic performance with the ANOVA test. In conclusion, teachinglearning-evaluation strategies must be implemented for the different groups of students, in order for the students to achieve adequate performance. © 2020, Universidad del Zulia.

abstract={This Research Full Paper presents a review of recent studies on SIGCSE about teaching programming (CS1) and data structures (CS2) for university students in computer science courses. Our main contribution is the identification of three categories and their respective subcategories for teaching programming: (i) characterization of contents, (ii) identification of pedagogical strategies and (iii) grouping of support tools. Context: Technology is increasingly more present in modern life. This demands qualified professionals in algorithmic thinking and coding. However, teaching programming is a challenging task, with frequently high dropout and failure rates. Because of this there is a large amount of scientific literature about methods and tools for teaching this topic. A systematic review to compile existing techniques can be very useful for teacher and professionals interested in the area. Objective: The goal of this paper is to identify and discuss the recent approaches used in teaching algorithms and data structures presented in the last five years of SIGCSE. Thus, we investigated the following research question: What are the recent approaches to teaching programming and data structures? Method: We conducted a review of the primary researches published in SIGCSE Technical Symposium during 2014-2018. All primary studies published in this period were evaluated according to the inclusion criteria. The studies related to our objective were completely read, passed through the extraction of data and classified according to the research questions. Results: In the end of the selection phase, 60 papers were used to conduct this research. Our results were classified into three categories: (i) contents were identified in 60 papers. We found that CS1 is predominant, it is present in 76.7% of papers. Whereas the teaching of CS2 is present in only 38.3% of the papers; (ii) teaching strategies were identified in 32 papers. Active learning approaches are usually the target of these studies. It should be noted that pair programming was present in 18.3% of these papers; finally (iii) 28 papers were found about support tools and most of them are focused on visualization and animation. Conclusion: Effective pedagogical approaches for teaching CS1 and CS2 are of great concern for educators around the globe. There is also a need for more tools that support the teaching of these disciplines. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Higher education students exhibit difficulties in learning computer programming, particularly transitioning from initial programming to advanced programming, so it’s necessary to develop effective teaching strategies. We developed the SimProgramming approach to help students overcome learning difficulties transitioning from entry-level to advanced computer programming, by developing appropriate learning strategies. The students perform a specific set of tasks in a learning environment that simulates business operations, developing a problem-based learning assignment. One of those tasks is filling biweekly individual self-reflection and co-reflection forms. This approach was implemented at the University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro (Portugal), in a 4th semester course of two bachelor programmes: Informatics Engineering and ICT. The students provided 37 biweekly forms, on which we conducted thematic analysis to identify their strategies for co-regulation of learning during the assignment. Students are adopting different strategies in each phase of the approach. Early phases are devoted to organization, planning, and transformation of information, and later phases focus on applying theoretical knowledge and hands-on programming. We recommend including this type of pedagogical task (biwekly self-reflection and co-reflection forms) in educational practices, in view of their contribution to improving self- and co-regulation learning strategies. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={Several strategies and methods have been designed and tested to allow students to have better teaching and learning of programming concepts and training their programming skills acquired. In our university, old and classic pedagogical methods are still used in the learning of Oriented-Object Programming (OOP). This paper explores the experimentation of a pedagogical approach designed for Mostafa Stambouli Mascara University’s computer sciences students to enhance their chances to get an effective teaching using a collaborative learning and early introduction of current technologies. The study was made of 108 second year informatics students’ for two semesters (October–January 2016-2017, September-December 2017-2018) who were identified in a controlled experience for collaborative learning OOP in lab session. Students gathered into predetermined groups based on initial test and some setting. The students are supposed to share the same programming assignment by distributing roles according to global pedagogical scenario for problem-resolving activities. This experience allows the teachers to apply this strategy and see students in closer and permit them to express their problems and search together for solutions. The principal objective was to offer a new experience to motivate students and make this design a smart opportunity to have better programming performance. Furthermore, as a result of testing this new strategy, the students’ academic progress is clear. A questionnaire was distributed with the purpose of analyzing students’ motivation and satisfaction levels alongside the effects of the experiment. Results show that students found that among other benefits this method facilitates the learning process. © 2019 Slovene Society Informatika. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Most courses on cluster computing in graduate and postgraduate studies are focused on parallel programming and high-performance/high-throughput computing. This is the typical usage of clusters in academia and research centres. However, nowadays, many companies are providing web, mail and, in general, Internet services using computer clusters. These services require a different “cluster flavour”: high-performance service and high availability. Despite the fact that computer clusters for each environment demand a different configuration, most university cluster computing courses keep focusing only on high-performance computing, ignoring other possibilities. In this paper, we propose several teaching strategies for a course on cluster computing that could fill this gap. The content developed here would be taught as a part of the course. The subject shows several strategies about how to configure, test and evaluate a high-availability/load-balanced Internet server. A virtualization-based platform is used to build a cluster prototype, using Linux as its operating system. Evaluation of the course shows that students knowledge and skills on the subject are improved at the end of the course. On the other hand, regarding the teaching methodology, the results obtained in the yearly survey of the University confirm student satisfaction. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This study explores how first year students in Information Technology Engineering at College of Science and Technology, Royal University of Bhutan, learn C programming. An online questionnaire was administrated to the students and asked about time spent in collaborative learning, individual coding and watching someone code. These data were analyzed in correlating to their exam scores. Students' ways of preparing for exam and their concept on C programming are categorized. Our result indicate a relationship between how the different ways of working relate to their exam results. Further, the insights of the project point to that learning of theory of programming and practicing programming go hand in hand in a C programming course. Our intent is that this study will be helpful for future teachers and students in programming courses in Bhutan and in its region. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Many researchers have shown the good effects of collaborative learning. This learning strategy aims at providing learners, who are grouped in small groups, with some tools for increasing their cognitive and behavioral profiles. In CSCL (Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning) environments, knowledge construction appears through the interaction among peers. In the literature, there are many works that focus on collaborative learning but most of them ignore the key question: what is the appropriate method to be used for forming groups? In fact, having appropriate groups allows to get good interactions among group members, which improves the results of collaborative learning. In most cases, the grouping of learners has no criterion or uses a random selection. In this paper, we propose a new method for the automatic grouping of learners based on two criteria: the complementary skills on concepts and the learning styles obtained according to the Felder-Silverman model. The goal of the proposed clustering method is to have heterogeneous groups where each group contains members who have most of the concepts (each concept held by a student), and at the same time have different learning styles. The proposed approach is used by a CSCL system called ComGroupe, which is tested at an Algerian University. The obtained results of its first use are very encouraging. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Software verification and validation (V & V) is one of the significant areas of software engineering for developing high quality software. It is also becoming part of the curriculum of a universities' software and computer engineering departments. This paper reports the experience of teaching undergraduate software engineering students and discusses the main problems encountered during the course, along with suggestions to overcome these problems. This study covers all the different topics generally covered in the software verification and validation course, including static verification and validation. It is found that prior knowledge about software quality concepts and good programming skills can help students to achieve success in this course. Further, team work can be chosen as a strategy, since it facilitates students' understanding and motivates them to study. It is observed that students were more successful in white box testing than in black box testing. © 2014 TEMPUS Publications.},

abstract={Difficulties in teaching and learning introductory programming have been studied over the years. The students' difficulties lead to failure, lack of motivation, and abandonment of courses. The problem is more significant in computer courses, where learning programming is essential. Programming is difficult and requires a lot of work from teachers and students. Programming is a process of transforming a mental plan into a computer program. The main goal of teaching programming is for students to develop their skills to create computer programs that solve real problems. There are several factors that can be at the origin of the problem, such as the abstract concepts that programming implies; the skills needed to solve problems; the mental skills needed to decompose problems; many of the students never had the opportunity to practice computational thinking or programming; students must know the syntax, semantics, and structure of a new unnatural language in a short period of time. In this work, we present a set of strategies, included in an application, with the objective of helping teachers and students. Early identification of potential problems and prompt response is critical to preventing student failure and reducing dropout rates. This work also describes a predictive machine learning (neural network) model of student failure based on the student profile, which is built over the course of programming lessons by continuously monitoring and evaluating student activities. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={While promoting professional development among library workers is a priority for many academic libraries, library administrators often discuss the challenges involved in designing flexible, sustainable professional development programs that meet the diverse needs and interests of library workers. With investment in professional development around online teaching and learning becoming an institutional priority upon the onset of the COVID-19, we set out to create a flexible and sustainable professional development program that could facilitate conversations around teaching and learning in our libraries and that could be inclusive of all library workers throughout our distributed, multi-branch university library system. In this paper, we share our approach to developing virtual, miniature Communities of Practice (Mini CoPs), describing in detail the process of designing these groups and the formation of two distinct leadership roles within this program, the Community Coordinator and the Community Facilitator. We then describe our program evaluation strategies and findings from the first cohort of Mini CoPs. Based on our findings, we suggest that this program design presents a model for developing inclusive and sustainable professional development programming for librarians and library staff that has applicability even beyond the current constraints facing higher education. We close with a reflection on some of the potential limitations of our model, along with proposed next steps to consider. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={What this research was about and why it is important: Integrating content and language (ICL) has been a widely applied methodology of language learning and teaching in the last 20 years. However, ICL studies for first-year undergraduate students of science and engineering are scarce. This study examined perceptions of incoming students and professors who participated in ICL classes at a Korean science and engineering school. Most of the participants found the ICL classes helpful for students to develop a better understanding of content lectures and what to expect in regular content lectures. Also, many students found student-centered activities, consisting of group work, particularly motivating and effective. The study recommends a formula of ICL instruction for students entering a university with an EMI policy and concludes with suggestions for the successful implementation of ICL classes for content lectures in the areas of science and engineering. What the researchers did: ●This study investigated introductory ICL classes for incoming students at a science and engineering school in Korea. ●Five introductory ICL classes in the areas of biology, physics, chemistry, programming and mathematics were implemented as part of a three-week intensive English camp for 121 incoming students. ●Each ICL class consisted of pre-activities and post-activities in relation to a content lecture. ●A 12-question survey was administered at the end of the post-activities for each respective subject in order to investigate students’ perceptions of the ICL classes. ●Follow-up email interviews were conducted with students, professors, and teaching assistants. What the researchers found: ●The pre-activities involved tasks to activate students’ prior knowledge on the respective content lecture subjects, vocabulary previews, and the teaching of note-taking strategies. ●The purpose of the post-activities was to reinforce students’ learning and understanding of the knowledge they acquired from the pre-activities and the content lectures. ●Students found vocabulary the most difficult part in understanding English lectures, although they were aware of the importance of vocabulary to their studies. ●Most students preferred the more integrated aspect of ICL classes than they did language-focused classes. ●Mostly easier content materials should be dealt with in class with some advanced materials mixed in to boost students’ participation. ●Providing a scaffolded language environment during ICL pre-activities has the potential to elevate students’ content knowledge and encourage them to improve language ability. Things to consider: ●There is a need for continued research and development of effective ICL methods for science and engineering students and particularly for those entering EMI-implementing tertiary schools. This study investigated the case of a Korean science and engineering university; thus, its implications may be limited to other similar settings. ●In their first year, L2 students need most help in adjusting to college life set in an EMI environment. It is our hope that this study will stimulate interest in many language educators and serve as a start for further research and development of similar programs in the future. © 2020 TESOL International Association},

abstract={Many studies have utilised the potential of mobile games to promote students’ learning performance, while few have transformed compiler working steps into mobile games. In this paper, the researchers developed a mobile game by simulating the C compiler working steps with daily life situations. Afterward, the researchers applied a lecture-based learning approach to implementing the game in a Thai university C programming language course. The group implemented a mobile game-transformed lecture-based approach by comparing it to conventional lecture-based approach and mobile game approach. The findings of this study support the notion that students can better achieve the C programming language concept through a mobile game, especially when integrated with the process of lecture-based approach. The findings of this study also highlight the mobile game-transformed lecture-based approach support the students’motivation to learn the C programming language.

abstract={To help students overcome their learning difficulties in the transition from entry-level to advanced computer programming, developing an appropriate set of learning strategies, the SimProgramming teaching approach has been adopted at the University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro (Portugal). This approach is based on four conceptual foundations: businesslike learning environment, self-regulated learning, co-regulated learning, and formative assessment. In this approach the students develop an activity based on problem-based learning, with a specific set of tasks based on those four conceptual foundations. The approach was implemented in two courses from the second and third curricular years of the bachelor programmes in Informatics Engineering and Information & Communication Technologies. We conducted semi-structured interviews with students (n=32) at the end of the courses, to try to identify the students’ strategies for self-regulation of learning in the activity developed within the SimProgramming approach. The main strategies identified were: organization, planning, time management, identification of difficulties, resolution of the difficulties encountered, work review, identification of the factors that influenced their motivation, and structure of the environment. The factors influencing the motivation most often identified by students were the impact of the assessment in the final course grade, the completion of the course, learning, skills development, and teamwork. Generally, students applied strategies to solve the difficulties, in particular by searching for social help and information search. Procrastination was also often identified by students. Strategies of time management, transformation of information, in-depth review, self-reflection, and self-evaluation were referenced scantily. We found that students changed some of their strategies from one course edition to the next. We conclude by recommending the development of educational practices to help students review their work, treat and process the information they find, conduct self-reflection and self-evaluation of their performance during tasks, adopt concentration strategies, and become aware of their specific difficulties. © 2016, University of Minho.

abstract={Programming is a core subject in most Computer science programmes at university level but research studies indicates that students face difficulties with the understanding of theoretical concepts as well as practical code construction. The Digital natives or the Net-generation are now enrolling university programmes and they are the first generation that has used computers and online tools since childhood. Programming education has a tradition of programming huts, where students in introductory programming courses get exercises to explore fundamental programming concepts with instant feedback. To provide quality feedback in the traditional form requires experienced facilitators and costly venues for today's large course batches. At the department where this study has been conducted there exists a tradition of a weekly lab hut for general Computer science but an online environment with 24/7 access would be an enhancement. This study has explored the potential of an online environment for programming exercises in the Python programming language named MyProgrammingLab. The aim of the study is to describe and discuss how an online programming laboratory might support the learning of programming concepts in introductory university courses. The research strategy has been a case study where data has been collected by an evaluation questionnaire, informal discussions and an analysis of students' study patterns in the virtual learning environment. Findings indicate that students have different learning styles and that some students have worked thoroughly with most of the material in MyProgrammingLab, but that the majority only have used the environment for the initial exercises on fundamental programming concepts. Some learners also mention that they got stuck in the online environment and that they lack the feedback that they can get in tradition face-to-face sessions. Conclusions are that the evaluated online environment can be a valuable extra tool for self-learning, but to reach a larger part of the course participants with their various learning styles there is a need for a closer alignment to the course content which would need a different course outline.},

abstract={Programming plays an important role in both academic and career development among engineers and computer scientists, however, acquiring and developing knowledge of programming is a complex process. Understanding program behavior is one of the most important factors in learning programming and in maintenance of existing programs. Here, the need exists to develop tools to facilitate understanding and to serve more than documentation and initial planning needs of a program (i.e., pseudo codes and flowcharts). In order to understand a program's behavior, a programmer needs a computer model that will execute it. Visualization has proven effective as a strategy for providing programmers and students with clearer meaning of their codes, developing and maintaining programs, and learning programming. This paper proposes a new diagrammatic methodology that produces a conceptual representation of program instructions. It can provide a foundation for understanding the behavior of running programs. The paper also reports on applying the new method to teaching an introductory university course, the results demonstrate that it improves understanding of programming and its underlying computer operations. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={RoboCup is one of the major global AI events, gathering hundreds of teams from the world’s best universities to compete in various tasks ranging from soccer to home assistance and rescue. The commonality of these three seemingly dissimilar tasks is that in order to perform well, the robot needs to excel at the all major AI tasks: perception, control, navigation, strategy and planning. In this work, we focus on the first of these by presenting what is—to our knowledge—the first fully neural vision system for the Nao robot soccer. This is a challenging task, mainly due to the limited computational capabilities of the Nao robot. In this paper, we propose two novel neural network architectures for semantic segmentation and object detection that ensure low-cost inference, while improving accuracy by exploiting the properties of the environment. These models use synthetic transfer learning to be able to learn from a low number of hand-labeled images. The experiments show that our models outperform state-of-the-art methods such as Tiny YOLO at a fraction of the cost. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={Background and context: Emotions are ubiquitous in academic settings and affect learning strategies, motivation to persevere, and academic outcomes, however they have not figured prominently in research on learning to program at the university level. Objective: To summarize the current knowledge available on the effect of emotions on students while they learn to program. We were interested in what emotions have been studied, what kind of tools researchers have used to measure students’ emotions, what emotions arise most frequently when students learn to program, and how researchers use this knowledge. Method: A search of academic databases was performed using a search string constructed using PICo as a framework. A group of 29 studies that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed to answer a set of research questions derived from the study objective. Findings: Few studies have been conducted on the influence of emotions on learning programming. Research studies do not address gender differences. Research has been oriented along three main lines (a) determining what emotions are involved in the process of learning to program; (b) determining the behavioral patterns of novice students and how from this behavior their emotions can be identified; and (c) developing intelligent systems that respond adaptively to students’ emotions. Implications: The results provide an important foundation for researchers and instructors who are willing to recognize that learning to program generates strong emotions in students and that these emotions influence their learning and academic performance. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The fast pace of development of the Internet and the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic have considerably impacted the educative sector, encouraging the constant transformation of the teaching/learning strategies and more in technological areas as Educational Software Engineering. Web programming, a fundamental topic in Software Engineering and Cloud-based applications, deals with various critical challenges in education, such as learning continuous emerging technological tools, plagiarism detection, generating innovative learning environments, among others. Continual change and even more change with the current digitization becomes a challenge for teachers and students who cannot depend on traditional educational methods. The article presents a sustainable teaching/learning methodology for web programming courses in Engineering Education using project-based learning adaptable to the continuous web technological advances. The methodology has been developed and improved during 9 years, 15 groups, and 3 different universities. Our results demonstrate that the methodology is adaptable with new technologies that might arise; it also presents the advantages of avoiding plagiarism in students and a personalized induction for every specific student in the learning process. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Introduction: Programming can be an intellectually satisfying skill and is definitely considered useful. However, problem-solving with a computer involves much more than just learning programming language syntax. The theory and practice are interrelated in fascinating ways. Whether one thinks that the purpose of college or higher education is to prepare students for an occupation or to develop foundational knowledge with lifetime benefits (or both), computer science (CS) has become a fundamental part of 21st-century life. Even students studying in areas other than CS are likely to have significant encounters with computational thinking (CT) later on in life. Motivation and Objectives: Colleges and universities offer the opportunity for students to take as many courses as they desire in coding, programming, and CS taught by faculty members from that discipline area. However, this approach alone is deemed insufficient for computer-based problem-solving and computer programming. Effective programming teaching pedagogy also requires organizational principles that can guide us in formulating the overall design of a programming science curriculum (CS). In particular, we need strategies that help us structure multiple paradigm-based teaching curricula into manageable modules. This study aims to develop a framework for programming pedagogy. Research Methodology and Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted for identifying, evaluating, and interpreting relevant research to explore programming paradigms that could be incorporated for novice programmers, possible implementation strategies, and instructional methods for teaching text-based programming, CT concepts, and practices. Results and Findings: This paper's focus was on the pedagogical phenomenon of teaching programming considering the evolving paradigms, implementation strategies, and instructional methods and techniques through the lens of CT. Hence, a framework to design a learning path for pedagogical approaches that consist of CT concepts and practices within text-based programming were proposed. The proposed framework is based on the assumption that “any ongoing research on computing pedagogy requires a review of what CT is, how it impacts on teaching and learning and its role within the pedagogy advocated.” The programming pedagogy framework consists of four fundamental components: programming paradigm, implementation strategy, instructional methods, and instructional techniques. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

abstract={The teachers of programming ask often students to develop complete programs in the early stages of the course. This strategy is inadequate for many students because learning programming is a complicated process. Taxonomies of educational objectives, such as Bloom’s and its derivatives can be an excellent source to define and validate proposed educational models developed for teaching programming not only at the introductory programming level at the universities but also for teaching quite complex programming tasks, which require specialized skills and technologies. Several learning approaches and taxonomies from the teaching programming point of view are analyzed in the paper. Subsequently, individual phases of the selected taxonomies are mapped to the interrelated parts of the proposed conceptual model of microlearning framework prepared in the university environment. Finally, their mutual consistency and contribution to the teaching programming theory are discussed. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The study is carried out in response to the need to provide the economic digitalization of Russian regions with academic programs developed by national universities. In this regard, the paper is focused on researching into the reasons of the digital agenda disregarding higher education programs and their role in training the staff able to create new digital platforms and technologies, progressively introduce existing tools and decisions. The disclosure of the environment enabling to transform digitalization-based academic programs into an impetus of digital economy of a Russian subject, a driver to develop an innovative sector and a regional university network would address the shortage of highly qualified staff and help Russian regions catch up with the leading countries of digital transformation. The authors used a method of modelling to address the issues of providing regional economic digitalization with higher education programs within the framework of the unanimity of Russian and foreign scientific opinions and the world practice of territorial administration and sectoral governance. The paper presents theoretical and methodical basis for providing regional economic digitalization with higher education programs, provides an interpretation of triple-helix model as a method based on an innovative initiative and the equality of subjects in the chain ‘universities – businesses – governments’, reveals the direction of how to use the model in diversifying academic programs and distributing them spatially. The research has resulted in grounding the theoretical and methodical foundations of modelling as a method to providing regional economic digitalization and regional industries with higher education programs; a model well-balanced with regional and industrial strategies, university research activities; a strategy to implement the model in the economy of Russian regions. The study is scientific and practical value for researching into socio-economic development of Russian subjects and regional university networks, programming educational development. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={It is consensual to consider teaching and learning programming difficult. A lot of work, dedication, and motivation are required for teachers and students. Since the first programming languages have emerged, the problem of teaching and learning programming is studied and investigated. The theme is very serious, not only for the important concepts underlying the course but also for the lack of motivation, failure, and abandonment that such frustration may imply in the student. Immediate response and constant monitoring of students' activities and problems are important. With this work, it is our goal to improve student achievement in courses where programming is essential. We want each student to be able to improve and deepen their programming skills, performing a set of exercises appropriate and worked for each student and situation. We intend to build a dynamic learning model of constant evaluation, build the profile of the student. The student profile will be analyzed by our predictive model, which in case of prediction of failure, the student will have more careful attention. Predict the student's failure with anticipation and act with specific activities, giving the student the possibility of training and practicing the activities with difficulties. With this model, we try to improve the skills of each student in programming. © 2019 ACM.},

abstract={Population aging presents challenges and opportunities that Michigan State University (MSU) is now taking on in a strategic way, but it has been a long road to reach a major milestone of establishing a program called AgeAlive. AgeAlive builds on fifty years of advocacy for coordinated aging-related programming and a more current grassroots effort that has led to a commitment to building an aging network connecting research, education, and outreach efforts based on Age-Friendly University principles. This case study describes AgeAlive’s path from inception to a recognized program with a clear vision and strategic plan. Concrete goals include a complete inventory of aging-related activity on campus, a virtual hub for networking and information exchange, educational opportunities for students and elders, and building new retirement pathways. The MSU experience may benefit others interested in developing similar programs by offering strategies for moving forward amidst challenges inherent in large-scale, research-intensive institutions. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Computer games are nowadays very popular among various generations and it doesn’t really matter which device they use to play them on. Creation and implementation of didactic computer games and the desire to create their own games are challenging to learn the programming for both, high school and university students. The article describes the problem and project teaching of programming at the university, where the theme of the project is " the implementation of didactic computer game of their choice.” The project can be realized in individual or in group form. Programming environment or programming language to implement the computer game is freely selectable. Students can work in any higher programming language with a rich graphics library, or they can use a programming environment that supports computer games creation. Depends on the skill of the programmers/developers/team members how to share the work. Can be individually addressed by the individual functional parts of the game, or work can be divided into separate layers. Each team member is engaged with him in what is good, for what who has better conditions to be successful and achieve a good result. E.g. one focuses on graphic design of game, next to the algorithms that express check compliance with the rules of the game, next member of team developing winning strategies, other looks at how the game stopped and resumed, how increases the difficulty level of the game as power play value and how the achieved good performance. Solving the project students learn to work in a team and practically use the knowledge from the field of software engineering. © 2019, National Defence University - Carol I Printing House.

abstract={Technological innovation in science provides complementary tools for exploring new teaching strategies within a pedagogical framework that promotes interaction between the teacher and the learner. This work is based on the implementation of a computer application modeling crystallographic material structures, in order to identify and study the different crystalline structures and their characteristics, based on the techniques of three-dimensional modeling covering the OpenGL library and the Euler rotation matrices, and developed by the C # programming language. The analysis and design of this study ranging from the study of the existing, the identification of the problematic, modeling and development, and finally the validation tests. Our research is aimed at second-year chemistry students at Ben M’sik Faculty of Science, Hassan II University of Casablanca, Morocco. We wish to conduct a comparative study between classical methods and after numerical simulation, in order to identify didactic factors influencing the cognitive engagement of learners. The results were good, 89.20% of students in the first group who worked on manipulations using the simulation application scored above 15/20, and 90.22% scored above 15.20./20 for the second group after completion of the manipulations according to the two modalities (traditional and computer). Teachers mentioned that the results have been favorable and support the recommended educational objectives for effective integration of this computer system, which seems to be effective for students who have tried to interact with the practical work to understand the phenomenon of crystallography by a virtual simulation on computer. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

abstract={The universities in Taiwan include the ability to program as the key competency in response to the new curriculum for Basic Education announced by Taiwan's Ministry of Education. However, for students without computer science backgrounds, the traditional programing courses which emphasis on the coding statement and algorithm theory could lead to the lack of learning motivation. Therefore, this exploratory work-in-progress study try to propose an undergraduate programming language course to conduct empirical evidence-based research in universities. The study focus on the integration of flipped classroom and live-coding video to explore the programming education. We focus on the online course in combination with Live Coding and multiple annotations, which explores the advantages of skill-based learning, live coding, program annotation and note sharing. Moreover, the programming materials and strategies suitable for general education curriculum have be developed. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={How to develop the programming skills in students is a big concern for most of the programming-teachers. Since programming involves higher order thinking skills, teachers use many teaching strategies to develop higher thinking skills in students. Flipped classroom is one such innovative method for achieving the same. The objective of this study was to teach programming in Java to the underachievers using the flipped classroom method and the high achievers using the traditional approach and to examine how the low achievers perform in programming with respect to the high achievers after undergoing the flipped classroom sessions. The study participants were the 4th semester students in B. Tech. Computer Science (2015 admission at Cochin University College of Engineering Kuttanadu, Kerala, India). They had a lab in data structures using Java and Java was not taught in the class as part of the syllabus. Hence, the students find it difficult to do the data structures lab, which motivated the authors to teach them Java as evening classes. The students were asked to rate their programming skills as either good, average, poor or very poor. Based on their feedback and their previous semester marks in programming in C++, they were classified either as underachievers or high achievers. The total duration of this extra class was fixed as ten hours for each group. After the fifth and tenth classes, same tests were conducted for both the groups and the results were analyzed using t-test. The results showed that the low achievers in the flipped classroom performed at par with the high achievers of the traditional classroom. © 2018 IEEE.},

We report here on the Carbon, Energy, and Climate fishbowl discussion series developed by Michigan State University Extension to assist the state's agricultural community in understanding and adapting to the changing climate. Facilitated dialogue reduced barriers to communication and promoted cooperative learning for target audiences and the project team, generating useful information on the current status of climate change adaptation within Michigan's agriculture sector and revealing needs to be addressed by future Extension programming. Using a dialogue-based approach such as the one we describe can highlight challenges and opportunities Extension faces in addressing various complex issues with diverse audiences. © by Extension Journal, Inc.},

abstract={This work-in-progress paper explores whether or not it is possible to teach dynamic systems and control effectively to students who do not take dynamics. Grand Valley State University offers two different versions of a junior-level dynamic systems and control course. One version is for mechanical engineering majors and requires dynamics as a prerequisite; the other version is for Product Design and Manufacturing Engineering (PDM) majors and does not have dynamics as a prerequisite. Learning outcomes are compared for students from these two different courses through common final exam questions and a common lab activity. This paper presents a baseline assessment of whether or not students who do not take dynamics can develop a solid understanding of the dynamics of under-damped, second-order systems along with a preliminary investigation into the effectiveness of several strategies for teaching dynamic systems. This paper also presents results from an online survey regarding how the course affected students' attitudes towards computer programming and their assessment of their programming skills. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.},

abstract={The identification of students' typologies plays interesting role in adapting educational strategies and improving academic performances. In this work, we show how unsupervised learning techniques can be applied to educational data for the extraction of typologies and profiles of graduate students based on educational outcomes in combination with the time to degree. We also describe a web-based tool for clustering student's data, based on R programming and shiny, in order to make the clustering analysis, more accessible for university decision maker. The clustering tool presented in this article will enhance the understanding of different learning characteristics of graduate students and could be used to adapt teaching approaches and strategies according to the identified student profiles. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: Learning is situated within an environment, cannot be dissociated from the context in which it occurs and impacts upon the results of student learning, obtaining better results in favorably perceived environments. The elements that mostly affect that perception are the curricular contents, teaching methodologies, and the handling of the education atmosphere. These elements, complex and dynamic, are perceived differently according to the level of the career. Some studies establish that the perception improves as the student progresses in the career, while others show the opposite. Objectives: Measure the perception of nursing students of the education atmosphere and compare the differences among the distinct levels of the career. Design: This was a longitudinal prospective study.Settings and Participants. The study was conducted with nursing students from the class of 2011 at Universidad de los Andes, Santiago-Chile. Sixty-one students complied with inclusion criteria and were surveyed in second (n = 55), third (n = 51), and fourth (n = 34) years, during 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively. Methods: The Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure questionnaire was applied. The STATA 10 program was used for analysis and the one way ANOVA was use to compare the results. Results: The average perception of the education atmosphere was 133/200, obtaining more positive aspects than negative ones. Students improve their perception as they advance in the career. The three measurements repeat five items as weaknesses and 12 as strengths. Conclusions: It is convenient to bear in mind the difficulties of students to reconcile the clinical experiences with the theoretical classes on campus by continuous assessing the academic load and the demands made by each professor. Some strategies would include promoting professors' greater closeness with the students, considering travel times in the academic programming, as well as applying the basic theoretical contents in real clinical cases to give them relevance. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This paper presents a project based learning at master level with strong interdisciplinary elements. Within the course of ICT and Mechatronics at Ghent University, the classical laboratory experiments do not present a suitable challenge for the students. In order to motivate them and rise their interest in the field, challenging smaller projects (i.e. control of a mechatronic system) are introduced in the curriculum. During the projects, the students have to use their skills such as programming languages (e.g. C++, Java etc.), communication, basic control techniques, etc. As an outcome, the students acquire the appropriate competences (e.g. ability to understand a mechatronic system, a motion control strategy, etc.) needed to deal with this kind of problems at industrial level. © 2016},

abstract={Blended Learning (BL) is considered a promising pedagogical approach. Some researches demonstrated that students' satisfaction ishigher for BL courses compared to completely online or face-to-face (F2F) courses. Moreover, the explosion of web 2.0 tools and the success of the "read-write Web" are reconfiguring the individual and collaborative blended learning processes. Based on this assumption, this paper investigates the effectiveness of web 2.0 BL for the design and delivery of a pilot course on e-business topics. Two experimentations have been organized involving undergraduates engineering students of the University of Jordan. According to the obtained results assessing students' reaction, learning and behaviour, the BL model proposed in the article revealed more effective than traditional F2F learning. A survey conducted at the end of the course also showed that students were satisfied with the pedagogical approach, and their academic achievements were also significantly improved. Findings demonstrate that successful BL programs require innovative curriculum design strategy based on new principles such as: a) the involvement of heterogeneous stake holders in the course's design phase; b) the focus on competence developmen trather than on knowledge transfer; c) the choice of team work as an additional component to evaluate individual students' performances; d) presence of remote and F2F interactions among peers and between teachers and students; e) the usage of web 2.0 tools as enablers of collaborative learning processes and social networking; f) continuous tutoring both for content and technological issues. These findings can help engineering colleges and universities to design and offer more effective learning courses. © 2014 TEMPUS Publications.},

abstract={In recent years, with the popularity of AI technologies in our everyday life, researchers have begun to discuss an emerging term “AI literacy”. However, there is a lack of review to understand how AI teaching and learning (AITL) research looks like over the past two decades to provide the research basis for AI literacy education. To summarize the empirical findings from the literature, this systematic literature review conducts a thematic and content analysis of 49 publications from 2000 to 2020 to pave the way for recent AI literacy education. The related pedagogical models, teaching tools and challenges identified help set the stage for today’s AI literacy. The results show that AITL focused more on computer science education at the university level before 2021. Teaching AI had not become popular in K-12 classrooms at that time due to a lack of age-appropriate teaching tools for scaffolding support. However, the pedagogies learnt from the review are valuable for educators to reflect how they should develop students’ AI literacy today. Educators have adopted collaborative project-based learning approaches, featuring activities like software development, problem-solving, tinkering with robots, and using game elements. However, most of the activities require programming prerequisites and are not ready to scaffold students’ AI understandings. With suitable teaching tools and pedagogical support in recent years, teaching AI shifts from technology-oriented to interdisciplinary design. Moreover, global initiatives have started to include AI literacy in the latest educational standards and strategic initiatives. These findings provide a research foundation to inform educators and researchers the growth of AI literacy education that can help them to design pedagogical strategies and curricula that use suitable technologies to better prepare students to become responsible educated citizens for today’s growing AI economy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Student success in introductory programming courses is a widespread concern. Success does not depend only on the individual characteristics of each student, but there is a set of factors that can interfere with academic performance. Especially in computer science courses, failure has a strong negative influence, since in many cases students are demotivated and, in many cases, they even drop out of the course. In this work, we present a collection of strategies, included in an application, with the objective of helping teacher and student in the teaching and initial learning process of programming. Early identification of potential problems and immediate response is a fundamental aspect to avoid student failure and reduce dropout rates. This paper also describes a machine-learning (neural network) predictive model of student failure based on the student profile, which is built throughout programming classes by continuously monitoring and evaluating student activities. Finally, we present the results obtained in the use of our set of strategies applied to our study group with particular characteristics in introductory programming course (Introduction to Programming), lectured to the first year, first semester, students of the CS course at the Polytechnic of Guarda (IPG), Portugal. © 2021 Owner/Author.},

abstract={This study analyzes the effectiveness of H5P services used to create interactive student evaluations on a Moodle platform. The content evaluated in this study comes from the Universidad Politécnica Salesiana (Guayaquil, Ecuador) Programing Course syllabus. Study participants are first year university students (18–20 years old). The students participate in a learning validation experience through Python Experiential Educational Platform (PEEP), designed for this purpose. A 75% improvement in retention of acquired knowledge is achieved by using active learning strategies during assessment. With H5P technology professors can reuse audio and video material previously recorded, together with the material they generate in each new class, allowing them to reuse resources not only for informative or didactic explanation, but also as an interactive evaluation resource made possible by interactive technologies designed for this purpose. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to examine librarians’ professional motivations and theoretical perspectives to attend to care and student voice, as they pursue open educational resource (OER) initiatives in higher education. Design/methodology/approach: The authors examine OER initiatives that serve as models for their work at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder), describe how they have attended to care and student voice in their work to date and reflect on how they hope to continue to do so in their future OER initiatives. Findings: The authors find connections between theoretical perspectives for care in education and the values and ethics of both the open education movement and librarianship. They propose that these connections provide a foundation for librarians to align their professional motivations and practices in support of learning. The authors provide examples of OER programming that attend to care and student voice and offer related strategies for practitioners to consider. Originality/value: Librarians at many post-secondary institutions provide critical advocacy and support the adoption, adaptation and creation of OER in higher education. Theories of care, values and ethics in the open education movement and librarianship provide a foundation for librarians to attend to care and elevate student voice as they undertake OER advocacy and initiatives. © 2020, Merinda McLure and Caroline Sinkinson.},

abstract={Hackathons are ‘hacking marathons’ in which participants collaboratively and rapidly prototype new applications over a 24–48 h period. The potential of hackathons as a strategy for stimulating interest in the CS fields is well known. Hackathons share many similarities with capstone courses, however their application as a formal teaching approach in the CS/IS curriculum is less prevalent. This paper describes the introduction of a curricular hackathon in a 3rd-year IS capstone course at a South African university. An exploratory case study was conducted to evaluate feedback from the participants and organizers. In the process, the students completed seven new applications which they had conceptualized during the course. They also learned something about new technologies and programming interfaces as well as they exhibited growth in personal and inter-personal competencies. Seven fundamental differences between curricular and traditional hackathons are highlighted.

abstract={Revolution in information technology imposed HEIs to transform their practice into a digital-oriented approach. Most high-ranked HEIs in Indonesia have been successfully integrated their business model with digital infrastructures and took benefit from digitalization. However, middle-rank HEIs are struggling to benefit and seize such opportunities. However, the ongoing process in the mid-ranked HEIs indicates substantial progress. This study aimed at describing the digital transformations process in the middle-rank HEIs in Indonesia. Data were gathered from in-depth interviews with 16 HEIs mid-rank university leaders in Indonesia. The data describes several forces and critical success to approach digitalization. There are essential dimensions as crucial factors such as IT infrastructure, clear objectives, employees support, and others. Suggestions and limitations are discussed in the last part of the paper. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.},

abstract={This article briefly compares the prison system in the United States with progressive correctional systems in the world, before pivoting to discuss the lessons learned from the author’s development of the Prison Education Project (PEP). PEP has expanded educational opportunities for inmates in 12 Californian correctional facilities. With the assistance of 800 university student and faculty volunteers, PEP has serviced approximately 5,000 inmates in these facilities since 2011. By providing academic, life skills and career development programming, PEP aims to educate, empower and transform the lives of incarcerated individuals. This article is a summary of the development of PEP, examining programme outcomes and highlighting implementation, fundraising and branding strategies. The robust spirit of volunteerism is also a central component of the discussion, with the phenomenon of “reciprocal reflex” at the heart of the PEP volunteer experience. This reflex ignites the passion and gratitude of both volunteers and inmates. The volunteers learn just as much as they teach, and the inmates teach just as much as they learn. The fact that each group shows deep gratitude to the other for the learning experience creates an exciting symbiotic loop and an esprit de corps which inspires and empowers all involved. The “reciprocal reflex” leads to lifelong learning. This article captures the intricate dynamics of how PEP has evolved into the largest volunteer-based prison education programme of its kind in the United States. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature, and UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning.},

abstract={The recent surge in Computer Science (CS), Information Technology (IT) and Software Engineering (SE) majors at universities across the nation has resulted in a number of challenges, including mitigating students' lack of preparedness for these programs. To overcome some of these challenges it is imperative that CS/IT/SE instructors make use of evidence-based pedagogical techniques that improve student learning and engagement in the classroom, e.g., active learning. In this paper we present a model that uses learning and engagement strategies (LESs) to improve student learning in face-to-face (F2F) classes with the support of a cyberlearning environment. These LESs include collaborative learning, gamification, problem-based learning and social interaction. SEP-CyLE (Software Engineering and Programming Cyberlearning Environment) contains vetted learning content in the form of learning objects and tutorials, and can be configured to use various combinations of LESs. We describe how LESs are integrated into the F2F and online activities of a software testing class. The results of a study we conducted that integrates LESs into the F2F activities of a software testing class show the potential positive impact such a pedagogical approach can have on CS/IT/SE classes. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019},

abstract={It is generally observed that students always find the difficulty in understanding and studying the algorithms of any course. Algorithm part of any course can be taught using a flowchart which is a diagrammatic representation of a program that represents an algorithm, work-flow or process. Flowchart helps the students understand how the algorithm works and will remember for a long time. But only flowchart is not sufficient for understanding some algorithms, so animated flowchart with the example to understand the steps of algorithm instead of normal flowchart is considered in the current study. This animated flowchart with example improves the understanding about algorithm, conveys the information easily, gives the clear view of algorithm and analyzes the problem effectively. Think-Pair-Share (TPS) is an active learning strategy, in which students work on a problem posed by instructor, first individually (Think), then in pairs (Pair) and finally together with the entire class (Share). TPS helps students understand fundamental knowledge of a topic, enable self learning ability, develop the ability to percolate information and draw conclusions, and improve technical and soft skills. In this paper, I have combined animated flowchart with example and TPS activity. This modified the TPS activity is named Animated Flowchart with Example Think-Pair-Share and is useful for algorithm based courses. The case study of algorithm based course like System Programming of Third Year Computer Science and Engineering is considered for this modified TPS activity. Animated Flowchart with Example Think-Pair-Share is a modified TPS activity in which first the algorithm is explained with help animated flowchart and then step by step working of algorithm is demonstrated with the help of example followed by TPS activity. One group pre-test and post-test model is considered for this study. It is found that Animated Flowchart with Example Think-Pair-Share activity is effective and results are also improved. Experimental results and students' perception about this activity are also presented in the study. Other active learning strategies conducted for System Programming course are also discussed which improved the university results. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Pressure is mounting for post-secondary institutions to demonstrate that their students have the skills needed for the workforce, particularly in professional programs. Common expectations among professional and regulatory bodies in information and communication technologies (ICT) include professional knowledge, understanding of systematic impacts and needs, problem solving, teamwork, technology resources, modelling and analysis, programming, and self-management. This article focuses on intentional development of ICT competencies in post-secondary education. The authors present a continuous improvement model for integrated curriculum design, with activities and assessments specifically selected to develop professional skills in the context of the discipline. The approach involves building common understandings, providing examples of effective teaching practices, using data for evaluation, and implementing high-impact strategies for attainment of competencies. Activities at Queen's University that have been supported by the authors are presented as a case study. Criterion-based assessment of authentic disciplinary tasks is shown to be effective in detecting incremental improvement in competencies, and learning gains on standardized tests were significant and meaningful for problem solving, critical thinking, and communication. The use of standardized assessment has limitations, but feedback to departments enabled learning needs to be addressed. These examples are highlighted as part of a continuous improvement model to develop competencies by tailoring curriculum and learning strategies, assessing student achievement, and using the data to inform high-impact strategies for attainment of competencies. © Canadian Public Policy / Analyse de politiques, November / novembre 2018},

abstract={Due to the interdisciplinary nature of complex systems as a field, students studying complex systems at university level have diverse disciplinary backgrounds. This brings challenges (e.g., wide range of computer programming skills) but also opportunities (e.g., facilitating interdisciplinary interactions and projects) for the classroom. However, little has been published regarding how these challenges and opportunities are handled in teaching and learning complex systems as an explicit subject in higher education and how this differs in comparison to other subject areas. We seek to explore these particular challenges and opportunities via an interview-based study of pioneering teachers and learners (conducted amongst the authors) regarding their experiences. We compare and contrast those experiences and analyze them with respect to the educational literature. Our discussions explored approaches to curriculum design, how theories/models/frameworks of teaching and learning informed decisions and experience, how diversity in student backgrounds was addressed, and assessment task design. We found a striking level of commonality in the issues expressed as well as the strategies handling them, for example, a significant focus on problem-based learning and the use of major student-led creative projects for both achieving and assessing learning outcomes. © 2018 Joseph T.

abstract={Domotics as a branch of automation has achieved remarkable advances in recent years, due to the enormous development of telecommunications that has allowed improving and complementing services of this type of solutions. It is necessary in the electronic engineering programs of the universities, to develop methods and strategies that facilitate the teaching of these subjects in a practical way, so that the student learns by doing. This article describes the development of a didactic dashboard for the teaching of domotics; integrated by sensors, actuators and a computer control interface to facilitate the execution of laboratory practices aimed at solving problems of comfort, safety and energy management at home in an interactive way. In order to verify the usefulness of the domotic dashboard in the teaching-learning process, a survey was applied to a group of teachers and students in Universidad de la Costa in Barranquilla, Colombia, showing that the board can become a useful resource for domotics learning. © 2006-2018 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={Global engagement programming across higher education continues to expand as institutional leaders and practitioners strive to meet global citizenship and civic engagement outcomes. This article presents case study research on a global service-learning partnership, the “Christian University” (CU) Wheelchair Project, which has involved students in a three-semester course sequence that includes research under faculty guidance at a Kenyan school serving 300 children with disabilities. The coauthors participated with the CU students to address the following research questions: (a) What are the characteristics of a Christian Global Service-Learning project that involved partnerships? and (b) What are the observed expectations and impacts of this partnership in the local setting? The case study offers an example of a global service-learning partnership that is grounded in institutional and community input throughout the project's conception and implementation, as well as during assessment of the program. Analysis of the data revealed three components of this program as an effective model of a global service-learning partnership: (a) shared representation throughout the program, (b) valuing both student and community outcomes, and (c) additional perceived community benefits. Corbett and Fikkert's (2012) relief-rehabilitation-development and Fraser's (2009) parity of participation frameworks were used to illustrate why it is necessary to intentionally develop partnerships where the local community can genuinely participate. Drawing from the related literature, the authors argue that global service-learning with partnership programs have the potential to move Christian higher education beyond simply service to transformative and sustained community collaboration in which social justice can be effectively enacted. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Data were collected over a seven-month period in 2014 from interviews with 19 faculty and global learning and development leaders who represented 13 CCCU member institutions. The findings documented a wide variety of CCCU-sponsored global programs and partnerships, the motives and faith foundations for these global initiatives, and various levels of institutional support for global programming. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This paper reports on an investigative, qualitative case study of the teaching practices of two public high school Computer Science teachers as they teach courses that are fully or partially aligned with the CS Principles framework. One teaches at an urban, high minority STEM school, the other at a middle class suburban school. Ethnographic methods were used to collect data via classroom observations and teacher interviews. Within-case and across-case analyses are presented which characterize the teachers' practices regarding pedagogy, curricula, creative activities, problem-solving activities, and management of social interactions. The findings provide detailed insights regarding the challenges these teachers face and the strategies they use, which may be useful to teachers in a variety of settings at both the high school and college/university levels. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Attendance has shown to have a positive effect on student performance in numerous disciplines. However, very few studies have focused on how attendance influences the learning of programming in the U.S. higher education system. This paper examines the relationship between attendance and student performance in introductory programming courses. Data were collected from 103 students from nine class sessions of introductory programming classes taught at University X by two instructors in the department of Computer Science in the first and second semesters during the 2014/2015 academic year. The statistical analyses showed a significant positive correlation between attendance and student programming performance beyond other factors. Thus, encouraging attendance is recommended to educators as a pedagogical strategy. Copyright 2016 ACM.},

abstract={One of the biggest barriers to MOOC development is the large initial cost - sometimes exceeding $100,000 - and the possibility of never recovering that cost through course-related fees. This obstacle prevents many state universities and community colleges from creating their own MOOCs, denying faculty at those institutions the opportunity to develop MOOC-related content and to gain experience with this new teaching style. This paper presents a successful strategy for primarily undergraduate institutions to create their own MOOCs using local resources at relatively low cost. The authors discuss the development and implementation of Cal Poly Pomona's first MOOC, which was offered for 10 weeks during Spring 2014. The MOOC was an introduction to computer programming course and was open to everyone in the world for free. It was developed in stages over two years at a total cost of approximately $10,000 to the university. Significant savings were achieved by hosting the MOOC on a free platform (Blackboard CourseSites), repurposing existing materials from a hybrid course, hiring student assistants for video production, and utilizing undergraduate student volunteers to help on discussion boards. A total of 2119 participants enrolled in the course with 335 participants (16%) receiving a passing grade. Participants who were still actively engaged in the course by Week 2 had a much higher passing rate of 58%. Discussion boards and surveys provided feedback about the course format, participants' demographics, and participants' attitudes of the course. Most participants possessed at least a bachelor's degree, took the course primarily to enhance job-related skills, and were unaffiliated with the university. Participants' comments about the MOOC were overwhelmingly positive and the MOOC enhanced their attitudes toward the subject matter. Based on the success of this first offering, an expanded version of the MOOC was offered during Spring 2015. © 2016 American Society for Engineering Education. All rights reserved.},

The authors also would like to thank Dr. Shanthi Srinivas and Dr. Victoria Bhavsar for providing support for the project and giving valuable feedback about many aspects of the course, Professor Jaehoon Seong for assisting with the development of the hybrid version of ME 232, and the five discussion boards still manageable? Is it necessary to have multiple instructors for course management? Is it possible to offer a much larger MOOC for a similar cost as the smaller MOOC and, if so, can a major portion of the cost be recovered through course-related fees? In order to help answer these questions, during Spring Quarter 2015 the lead author taught the same MOOC again with the goals of increasing enrollment to over 10,000 participants and recovering much of the costs. Below are some important modifications to the MOOC for the second offering.},

abstract={The use of educational robotics for programming education has been shown to be effective in fostering students’ computational thinking (CT) skills. However, physical educational robots are expensive, which may limit their wide use in the classroom. This study used augmented reality technology to develop a virtual educational robotic system (AR Bot for short), which offers 3D visual learning feedback to strengthen spatial ability, as well as delayed feedback and auto-scoring feedback to promote students’ deeper CT processes. To examine the impact of AR Bot on programming learning, this study used a quasi-experimental design to compare an experimental group of 41 first-year university students who used AR Bot and a control group of 34 first-year university students who used Scratch. We assessed the impact of the two CT tools on students’ internal learning processes (enjoyment of learning), CT skills (problem decomposition, algorithm design, and algorithm efficiency skills), and academic achievement. The results showed that students who used AR Bot had higher enjoyment of learning, algorithm design skills, and algorithm efficiency skills but not higher problem decomposition skills and academic achievement than students who used Scratch. Enjoyment of learning led to higher problem decomposition, algorithm design, and algorithm efficiency skills but not academic achievement. Problem decomposition and algorithm design skills, but not algorithm efficiency skills, led to academic achievement. The theoretical and practical implications of the proposed tool and other CT tools in programming education are discussed. © 2022},

abstract={Motivation More and more high schools are teaching programming, and in many cases, teachers teach multiple programming languages to the same group of students. Objectives The goal of this paper is to explore the views of high-school teachers on second and subsequent programming languages, including their motivation for teaching multiple languages, their struggles, and their use of transfer strategies when they teach their second or third programming language. Method The study consists of semi-structured interviews with 23 high-school teachers in two European countries. Results Our findings indicate that school pupils face the same issues as university students when moving from first to subsequent languages. Furthermore, the teachers' attitudes towards second language learning are highly variable, both positive and negative, with some supportive teaching strategies used, but many less helpful ones in evidence too. Discussion Our findings suggest that the value of second language learning needs to be highlighted in teacher professional development materials more strongly and that teachers might need more support in implementing transfer strategies. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={Collaboration skills are important for future software engineers. In computer science education, these skills are of-ten practiced through group assignments, where students develop software collaboratively. The approach that students take in these assignments varies widely, but often involves a division of labour. It can then be argued whether collaboration still takes place. The discipline of computing education is especially interesting in this context, because some of its specific features (such as the variation in entry skill level and the use of source code repositories as collaboration platforms) are likely to influence the approach taken within groupwork. The aim of this research is to gain insight into the work division and allocation strategies applied by computer science students during group assignments. To this end, we interviewed twenty students of four universities. The thematic analysis shows that students tend to divide up the workload to enable working independently, with pair programming and code reviews being often employed. Motivated primarily by grade and efficiency factors, students choose and allocate tasks primarily based on their prior expertise and preferences. Based on our findings, we argue that the setup of group assignments can limit students' motivation for practicing new software engineering skills, and that interventions are needed towards encouraging experimentation and learning. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Applying gamification strategies implemented in a virtual learning platform as support for face-to-face classes, is an educational proposal that increases motivation and commitment in carrying out autonomous activities and tasks, making learning fun. This proposal was applied in the Programming I (PI) subject of the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Sciences (FEAS) of the Central University of Ecuador (CUE), where the academic performance of the students was evaluated by comparing groups: experimental (gamified methodology) and control (traditional methodology). Surveys also assessed the gamified course and the strategies used that contributed the most to making learning fun. As a conclusion of the research, a gamified virtual learning platform made the students have fun learning to program, positively influencing their motivation for the development of autonomous learning activities, in addition to improving their academic performance. © 2021, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

abstract={Although purchasing state-of-the-art teaching equipment may be financially demanding, substantial efforts are being made at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim to provide students with an enhanced hands-on embedded system design experience in a sustainable manner. In particular, an approach that consists of adopting low-cost commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and tools for learning purposes is proposed in this work. This strategy effectively combines both industry standard highly-reliable automation controllers, such as Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) technology, as well as novel microcontrollers (i.e., the micro:bit microcontroller based on the nRF51822 system-on-chip (SoC)) explicitly designed for use in embedded systems education. This contributes towards a hands-on sustainable learning experience based on the applicability of Visible Learning (VL). The objective of this paper is to propose a novel organisation of the embedded systems module for the engineering cybernetics education curriculum. The intended outcome is to promote a novel teaching approach. This is achieved by engaging students in both a series of organised theoretical lectures as well as practical and highly involving laboratory group projects. Surface learning sections and deep learning sections are thoroughly alternated to stimulate understanding, making relations, and extending the students' knowledge. The course organisation and main topics, as well as result analysis of student surveys are discussed. The survey results and feedback from the reference group indicate that the course organisation and topics are effective and helpful for students. © 2021 TEMPUS Publications.},

abstract={This Research Full Paper presents our experience in analyzing and selecting block-based programming environments to support the teaching of algorithms for the students starting the introductory courses of a Computer Science major. The teaching of algorithms and programming concepts to students of the first years of Computer Science and Engineering courses has been a major challenge because students often have difficulty understanding the logic and abstraction, leading to a high dropout rate. Some strategies have been conducted to further the mission of helping students understand better those basic concepts, but this topic still remains a major problem for students in the initial grades of those courses. In previous projects developed at our university, we have already proposed the use of learning objects and gamification, with very positive results. One of the questions that arise when we adopt new teaching approaches is to know how this new path will contribute to the student's learning. In this project, we conducted a study on eight block-based programming environments and sought to identify which aspects of those environments comply with the Computer Science reference curriculum. Our work was based on the joint task force on Computing Curricula conducted by the ACM and IEEE Computer Society CS2013 curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in Computer Science. We studied the virtual programming environments Alice, MIT App Inventor, Blockly Games, Code.org, Gameblox, Pencil Code, Microsoft MakeCode and Scratch. Then, we crossed the characteristics of each, identified the positive and negative points of each teaching environment in relation to the topics established by the guidelines. We have classified the main characteristics of those programming environments, establishing criteria such as: prior programming knowledge requirements; ease of interaction with users; programming language code; availability of documentation for learning; programming practices addressed by the environment; and ease of learning programming. We believe that this work can contribute to the selection process of a suitable programming environment to be adopted in an introductory course of computer programming. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Software testing is a critical component of any software development lifecycle, but becoming an experienced software tester requires understanding many strategies for writing high-quality test cases and a significant amount of practice. Situated learning theory suggests that students should be exposed to things they would see in a professional workplace. In terms of software testing, students should be exposed to real-world software testing practices in a variety of contexts, from the simplest of programs to the very complex. The goal of this paper is to share our experience integrating software testing into our undergraduate curriculum at North Carolina State University. In this paper, we discuss how software testing is taught in our CS1 - Introductory Programming, CS2 - Software Development Fundamentals, and several other courses beyond CS2. Over the past 10 years of teaching software testing in introductory programming courses, we discuss lessons learned and highlight open concerns for future research. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Blended learning is increasingly used in college teaching, and formative evaluation has become the main method for assessing student performance. Based on the formative evaluation data of an existing course, how to model, analyze and predict the possible problems of students in the future learning process and give recommendations on learning strategy are problems worthy of in-depth study. In this paper, Apriori algorithm was used to perform association analysis on the formative evaluation data of the Fundamentals of Programming course in Nankai University, the results indicate that there are strong association rules between SPOC video scores, case study assignments scores, etc. K-Means algorithm was used to perform cluster analysis on SPOC platform scores, offline course scores and final exam scores, the results indicate that the advantages and disadvantages of students of different categories are consistent in two semesters. Finally, the clustering results of the first semester were added to the data set, Random Forest was used for feature selection, and four ensemble learning models were trained respectively to predict final exam grades. The results show that the XGBoost model works best, the accuracy of predicting the final exam grades of two semesters is 77.02% and 80.10%, respectively. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The incorporation of collaborative work in the educational field grows day by day, as do the number of research groups and projects associated with this topic; since the learning activities specified collaboratively promote communication, coordination, and negotiation within the groups. While this strategy's practical usefulness has been demonstrated at different training levels, not much emphasis has been placed on a fundamental part: the design of inherent collaborative processes. Collaboration Engineering highlights collaboration patterns and ThinkLets as primary design units, which has its primary objective reuse. This article presents a proposal for a collaborative activity to be implemented to support the teaching of initial programming courses at the university level, which bases its collaborative design on patterns and ThinkLets. © 2020 Universidad Autonoma de Bucaramanga.},

abstract={Accompanying electric circuits and computer programming, digital logic is deemed one of the most essential parts of any Electrical and Computer Engineering curriculum, so student success in the course is critical. Furthermore, research shows that the academic performance of students is heavily dependent upon student engagement, which is believed to increase with classroom strategies such as flipped-classrooms, cooperative learning, project-based learning, and virtual labs. The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) is a Hispanic serving institution with distributive campuses, where many of the students work part-time. With consideration of the special needs of our students and the latest developments in engineering education, this study focuses on our recent experience of teaching digital logical using MyFPGA, online FPGA platform. We first introduce the MyFPGA platform in this paper. Developed by one of the authors of this paper, this web-based design features I/O interfacing circuits with an Intel FPGA hardware board as well as API web services with the Intel Quartus II design software. The platform provides 24/7 real-time hardware design experience at students' fingertips, requiring only a web browser and internet access. It exposes the students to a complete engineering design cycle that includes problem specification, block diagram design, HDL source code design, simulation and hardware verification, trouble shooting and evaluation, and reporting. We consider different cases of the platform usage in two digital logic courses. To evaluate the effectiveness of the student learning experience, data is collected using outcome assessments, student feedback and self-evaluations, instructor observations, and comparative studies. Preliminary results confirmed the effectiveness of the online digital design platform. We have also identified a few pitfalls, such as instructors' initial reluctance in adopting the platform and students' first perception of the platform as a pure simulation tool. Based on the studies, recommendations are made to identify the best practices in the utilization of the platform to better serve Electrical and Computer Engineering majors and secondary school students interested in the general STEM fields. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.},

Initiated in 1999, the iCampus project is a research collaboration program between Microsoft Research and MIT whose goal is to create and demonstrate technologies with the potential for revolutionary change throughout the university curriculum [2]. As a result of the program, five projects have been institutionalized with a great success. One of them is iLab where students can use web browsers to design experiments and collect data from distant laboratory equipment. Another example is "eDiViDe: European Digital Virtual Design Lab" [2] [3], a 3-year project funded by the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) of the European Commission under the Erasmus program within the Lifelong Learning Program (LLP). The eDiViDe is a distributed digital lab platform across several institutes: KU Leuven - KHLim (Belgium), H-BRS (Germany), TUKE (Slovakia) and UiO (Norway). Each institute provides a different experiment setup. Users around the world can login to the same website and conduct experiments without the need to know the physical location of the lab. Thus, it is easily expandable. Other research activities on FPGA remote labs in Europe and Japan can be found in [4] [5] [6] [7].},

abstract={As the enrollment in computer science courses increases, faculty face the challenge of maintaining a standard of academic integrity in out of class programming assignments. One strategy to combat academic misconduct, is to incorporate more frequent in-class assessment. Traditional in-class assessment is often perceived as passive and taking away from valuable class time. Also, more inclass assessment could mean increasing the amount of test anxiety. Therefore, this paper presents results from a study that investigated the effectiveness of active, in-class programming assessment. The study was conducted in an introductory programming course with 93 undergraduate students at a mid-size, public university in the western United States. Three different assessment types were tested: collaborative, cooperative, and individual type assessments. A collaborative assessment is equivalent to pair programming. Cooperative assessments are partner quizzes where students must write their own code and are assessed individually, but may collaborative as much or as little as they like with their partner. Student performance was measured under multiple conditions including type of assessment and partner's active learning preference and factors like GPA, time in the semester, and section were controlled for. The results show that students perform better on both collaborative and cooperative type assessment than they do on individual type assessments. Also, the results show that students perform similarly on collaborative and cooperative assessments, which provides a nice alternative to pair programming for educators. Lastly, results show that most students prefer collaborative assessments over cooperative or individual. The majority of students prefer partner assessment to individual assessment. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.},

abstract={In recent years, Computational Thinking (CT) has been claimed to be a powerful way for competencies and skill development for students at any stage. Programming has been the main tool for CT development; nevertheless, several issues associated with learning and teaching programming exist and have been widely described. In this study, we designed and tested in a qualitative way a set of active pedagogical strategies to implement an alternative way to immerse university students in the learning process of CT development. Such strategies were designed and analyzed under the socio-cultural vision of learning, in which individuals interact in communities to build significant knowledge. Results showed that our curriculum design engaged students in the active use of five key skills related to CT, which could be used as the base ground for further programming learning and high-level CT skills development. Additionally, data indicates that students were involved in reflective processes of learning, as well as in the development of key competencies such as teamwork, communication skills and creativity.

abstract={The emergence of block-based environments aims to facilitate the problems caused by the abstractness of text-based languages. Recent studies generally focus on the effect of having block-based experience on programming education. This study is an attempt to observe the transfer of previous programming experiences (block-based vs. text-based) into a three-dimensional game-making environment through the use of backwards fading. In addition to observation of transfer, students' perceptions about the difficulty of practices were also investigated. Twenty-one senior university students participated in the study. They practiced through worked example, completion example, and full practice. Moreover, the comparison of the contribution of three examples, their perceived difficulty, and cognitive load has also been observed. There are four main findings that add value to the current literature. First, students having text-based programming experience had higher scores, which may be a sign of far transfer; second, completion example format was more efficient for students having block-based programming experience; third, full practice format was perceived as more difficult than either worked example or completion example; and fourth, based on the efficiency of example formats, completion example represented high efficiency for all students. However, average efficiency of all example formats has represented high efficiency for students, who had text-based programming experience. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={Every field of engineering and technology consists of problems to be solved using computers. Learning problem solving skills using computer programming in the first year is important. At first year, students learn various courses of engineering streams, they should inculcate the development of solutions to problems which yields better logic development for further years of graduation. So the aim of Computer Programming (CP) course as part of curriculum in first year is to develop solutions to the problems using Python and MATLAB programming. Students get admitted to first year by Directorate of Technical Education (state government body for allocating engineering seats for merit students) with various backgrounds like heterogeneous culture, unable to cope with learning abilities, immaturity, language and communication gap, different education boards etc. Need a different kind teaching learning methods where every student must understand and solve the problems. Earlier we used to teach students of Savitribai Phule Pune University the course, Fundamentals of Programming Languages-I & II, when many challenges came to surface as discussed, which impacted on their result. Earlier the result was around 50 to 60%, now use of ICT and conducting different activities it is reaching around 80%. Thanks to IUCEE for conducting training for how to teach millennium students and providing awareness of different kinds of ICT tools for teaching. By this we have come to know that teaching using ICT is one of the best ways to develop solutions to problems using programming skills. We used different learning aids such as learning management system like moodle, google classroom, canvas. Activities like think-pair-share(TPS), online quizzes on socrative, kahoot, zipgrade etc., roleplay, collaborative learning strategies like STAD, jigsaw etc., gallery walk. The paper also shows the reflective report of each activity conducted in graphical representations. The graphs show that thinking ability of students has improved. In the future, we want more ICT tools to be used to improve thinking ability and result of final course examination by overcoming difficulties occurred during previous year implementation. © 2019, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology.

abstract={An unpleasant sense of isolation is a common complaint amongst computing students and professionals alike. It is a well-documented cause of attrition throughout the discipline, one to which those from backgrounds already underrepresented in computing are particularly vulnerable. Though no silver bullet exists, collaborative work and learning strategies (such as pair programming) are a well-researched, commonly-practiced means of deterring this sense of isolation. However, studies on the employment of collaborative learning strategies in college-level computing coursework have focused almost exclusively on the use of pair programming methodology in traditional programming courses. A gap exists in the literature with regard to the employment of collaborative learning strategies in non-traditional programming courses, such as those teaching modern game development using visual scripting languages. This paper will present the findings of a pilot study integrating formal collaborative learning strategy into a game development course taught at a large Midwestern university in the United States; the coding platform employed in the course was the Blueprints Visual Scripting system (Unreal Engine). The learning strategy employed in the course, formal collaborative learning, consists of students working together to jointly achieve specific shared tasks, assignments, and learning objectives over a period of time ranging from 1 class period to several weeks. This paper first discusses the pedagogical and assessment changes this integration entailed. The findings are then presented, with subsequent discussion guided by constructivist learning theory and social interdependence theory. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019.},

abstract={The purpose of this examination is to research viable methodologies for incorporating Project based Learning (PoBL) in instructing and learning Woodwork Technology Education (WTE) at tertiary foundations in Nigeria. A mixed method approach including both quantitative and subjective technique was utilized for the investigation. The example of the examination involved 50 in-administration postgraduate understudies from Nigerian tertiary foundations concentrating Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) in University Teknologi Malaysia for the quantitative perspective, and 9 inadministration post graduate understudies for the subjective part. A 16-thing organized poll was utilized for quantitative information accumulation while semi organized meeting convention was utilized for subjective information gathering. Quantitative information was investigated utilizing SPSS programming variant 24 to process the rate and intend to demonstrate the degree of understanding or difference on things of the survey. NVIVO 12 was utilized for subjective data examination. Member check and pear questioning were utilized to build up the reliability of the interview convention. The principle discoveries of the examination uncovered that PoBL has not been embraced in WTE educating and learning at tertiary establishments of Nigeria, and the conventional instructional methodology including lecture, demonstration and task have been the instructional methodologies received. It was additionally uncovered from the discoveries that rebuilding of WTE educational plan at tertiary organizations in Nigeria to concentrate on a student focused methodology, just as sorting out courses and workshops for WTE speakers to be familiar with the utilization of PoBL in WTE instructing and learning as a component of the successful techniques for incorporating PoBL in instructing and learning WTE at tertiary establishments in Nigeria. PoBL is appropriate in the instructional procedures of courses like WTE which include intellectual and psychomotor aptitude procurement. At long last, the deficiencies of studies identifying with PobL in Nigeria illuminates the need to attempt this examination in WTE at tertiary organizations. © 2019 iJET.},

abstract={This study extends research on the effectiveness of creativity training and the importance of student engagement in higher education. Using data from the “Senior Transitions” topical module of the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE), responses from over 25,000 seniors at 266 different U.S colleges and universities demonstrate that exposure to creative coursework can predict student engagement in a variety of areas. Ordinary least squares regression models determined the effect of creative coursework exposure on NSSE’s established measures of student engagement: reflective and integrative learning, higher-order learning, use of learning strategies, collaborative learning, diverse discussions, student-faculty interaction, effective teaching practices, quality of interactions, and supportive environment. Results suggest that exposure to creative coursework is a significant positive predictor of student engagement, even after controlling for sex, transfer status, enrollment status, first-generation status, age, SAT/ACT, race/ethnicity, major, grades, percentage of online courses, institutional control (private/public), and institution size. Potential reasons for these patterns of results are discussed. Implications include updating curriculum and programming for greater exposure to creative assignments and activities across all major fields. © 2019, © 2019 World Council for Gifted and Talented Children.},

abstract={The percentages of 1dropout, accreditation and average grade of students that study university courses of Methodology of programming and Programming of first and second semester of career of Information and Communication Technologies in the Technological University of Puebla are not favorable and represent a problem to be solved by academic team, for the above, the main objective of present study is to show results of interventions carried out in front of a group of educational strategies that allowed to have better percentages in comparison with those obtained in the last 8 years. The first intervention involved evaluation of computational thinking through abilities of Generalization, Decomposition, Abstraction, Evaluation and Algorithmic Design, then students were offered 10 learning scenarios for Methodology of programming course. In the second intervention, 4 elements were manipulated to offer options in course of Programming, which were contents, modes of work, rhythms and time, and evaluation. In both interventions, use of Moodle platform allowed to expose learning contents and to have an appropriate context chosen by students. The main result was to generate personalized education as well as a learning experience that contributed to motivation of student in harmony with academic goals of initial programming courses. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={Learning computer programming is a challenging task as evidenced by high failure and dropout rates. Our work aims to overcome some difficulties of Software Engineering undergraduate students by collaborative learning practices of computer programming. In this paper we report the experience of a project executed at Federal University of Pampa to improve the practice in programming using Coding Dojos as a learning strategy. The project lasted two years and had fourteen meetings. Every meeting had three distinct moments: problem choosing, coding, and retrospective. We analyzed project results according to two perspectives. By Dojo Master perspective, we collected and summarized their perceptions by classifying what did it work and what did not work. In participants' perspective, we applied a survey to collect attitudes, which were examined through statistics and content analysis. Intersection of results point to the following positive general findings: collaborative and joyful environment favors learning, adoption of new programming practices fosters participation, and participants feel more engaged in problem solving. On the other hand, results indicate some issues that shall be addressed: exposure of programming in front of classmates is a barrier, and subsequent Coding Dojos over the same programming language. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={The ideal of self-paced learning, which was introduced nearly 50 years ago by Keller in his Personalized System of Instruction (PSI), has not yet been widely adopted. In spite of its perceived promise of helping students to learn at the speed aligned to their individual backgrounds, motivation, and skills, PSI has been challenging to implement. University teaching practice with weekly plans means that instructors expect students to learn at the same pace. Against this backdrop, this paper reports experiences from deploying PSI in multiple offerings of an introductory programming course at a Scandinavian university over five years. These include variations, such as a buddy system, rightsizing modules, encouraging pacing, alternative targets, intermediate milestones, active coaching, and time management, all primarily aimed at overcoming a key concern associated with PSI, namely, procrastination. The lessons associated with each are described with a view to providing fellow instructors with strategies and options that they can consider for implementing PSI into introductory programming courses. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Game-based learning is an emerging field that has become a part of university education and several researchers describe its strong learning potential. For several subjects there is a rich flora of learning games and commercial-of-the-shelf games available, but for programming education in general and Python programming in particular, the situation is different. There exists an economical aspect as well and to develop learning games for programming education, might not interest the mainstream game industry and most universities do not have the resources needed to develop their own tailor-made learning games. Digital gaming in general has had a fast expansion during the last decade and the generation that now is entering the universities has a habit of regular gaming. At the same time there are several studies reporting about low motivated students in introductory programming courses. In a time when commercial games for programming education are rare, universities must look for affordable ways to construct appropriate learning games. This study has investigated the idea of using learning games developed by university students as additional learning tools in an introductory programming course. Five student constructed games for learning to program in Python have been analysed. Eventually two learning games were selected and tested as part of a five week introductory programming course. The overall strategy has been action research with the aim to improve an existing programming course. A group of students have played the games in two workshops where data has been collected in a mix of questionnaires, observations and group discussions. Findings indicate that the general idea seems to work, but as for all kind of course content, there need to be a thorough assessment and iterative refinement. Despite some found bugs and interface flaws the games had a challenging gameplay as well as learning outcomes. The game-based workshops also had a catalytic effect and created energy as well as curiosity among the participants. To what degree the games and the workshops contributed to concrete learning outcomes will be further analysed after the second examination deadline.},

abstract={This evidence-based practice describes a new summer bridge model for increasing STEM retention. Beginning June 2012, Rice University developed the Rice Emerging Scholars Program (RESP), a comprehensive summer bridge and advising program aimed at increasing STEM retention, graduation, and achievement in students who attended under-resourced high schools. RESP is not a remedial program. RESP Scholars are admitted to Rice and are then invited to attend the bridge program in the summer before their freshmen year. A staff member whose sole job is advising the Scholars and overseeing daily program operations supports scholars through graduation. RESP is not a remedial program. Scholars are admitted to Rice through the same process as Rice students who do not participate in RESP. RESP participation is not a university admission requirement for Scholars. RESP staff partner with the Rice Admissions Office to find incoming students who are intellectually capable of work at a university level but who may not have been sufficiently challenged in K-12 settings. Because Scholars may not have been exposed to highlevel STEM courses (e.g., AP Calculus or Physics) or other academic course work as rigorous as what they will encounter at Rice, they may be lacking the skills necessary to excel in a rigorous STEM environment. This is particularly true in comparison to many of their classmates who benefitted from a more demanding high school experience such as that of a rigorous private high school or a strong public high school offering many AP and/or IB courses. RESP aims to help Scholars develop the skills needed to thrive at Rice through essentially a practice round in the summer. The objective of the summer bridge portion of the program is to prepare Scholars for the pace, rigor, and depth of the STEM curriculum at Rice. All Scholars take first-year Chemistry, Physics, and Calculus as courses, five days a week; homework, quizzes and exams are administered like in the academic year. As stated above, RESP is not a remedial program. Instead, the summer portion of RESP exposes students to the most challenging sections of Chemistry, Physics, and Calculus. Scholars simultaneously receive coaching from instructors, staff, and upperclassmen Fellows in study and learning techniques. This coursework is supplemented by individual Pre-Calculus remediation through ALEKS, an adaptive online learning system. Additionally, students complete modules in engineering design and problem-solving. RESP addresses acculturation through nightly sessions on topics pertinent to the transition from high school to college, promotes interactions with STEM faculty, and develops strong, multi-year cohorts of Scholars from similar backgrounds. RESP aims to support students comprehensively and proactively through the totality of their collegiate experience including and beyond academic support. RESP utilizes an intrusive advising model to provide academic advising and guide students before minor issues create permanent consequences. This model of advising was launched with the 2013 (second) cohort. Currently, students meet with an advisor weekly or bi-weekly through their third semester. Advising frequency after the third semester depends on student needs. Some Scholars continue meeting once a week through graduation while others make appointments as needed. Advising covers academic planning and success strategies, transition issues, and any personal problems that may impact a Scholar's retention in STEM or at Rice. All student performance is actively monitored, enabling advisors to intervene even if students are being seen less frequently. RESP's longitudinal, intrusive advising model proved so successful it has been adapted for other Rice students through the development of the Office of Student Success Initiatives. RESP additionally provides ongoing term-time programming to address common transition issues, training in learning and study technique, and student professional development. The effectiveness of RESP is tracked through comparison of Scholar performance to that of control group and the ambient background population. Data tracks retention at the University, retention in STEM fields, GPA, STEM GPA, and course selection and completion. Cumulative GPA results for Scholars and control are similar, around 3.0. For 2013 matriculants, 74% of Scholars are declared STEM majors, while only 54% of control group students were retained in STEM fields. Those matriculants completed more than twice as many core STEM credit hours as the control group within three semesters. RESP costs $10,000 per student over the duration of their time at Rice. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.},

abstract={Programming is a fundamental and mandatory subject in Computer science programmes at university level, but many students have difficulties to learn even the most basic programming concepts and techniques. Computer science has a tradition of face-to-face programming huts where students taking programming courses can explore important programming concepts with instant feedback from human facilitators. In contemporary blended learning where more and more of teaching and learning sessions are given by distance there is a need for online alternatives for self-learning. At the department where this study was conducted about half of the students fail to complete their introductory programming courses and many other universities face the same problem. Without facilitation, online or face-to-face, and appropriate alternatives for self-learning the fail rates would be even higher. The N-generation or the Digital Natives that now are entering university programmes are the first generation that has used computers, Internet and online systems since early childhood. Their digital prerequisites are better than earlier generations but at the same time they have higher demands for interaction in online environments. In this study two different online learning environments for self-learning were analysed and discussed to find answers to: "What are the most important factors in the design of virtual learning environments for self-learning of fundamental programming skills and knowledge?" The overall research strategy is the case study approach where students' attitudes on the use of online learning systems have been investigated in two programming courses. Data has been collected by interviews, evaluation questionnaires and group discussions. The explored online learning environments in this study are Pearson educations' MyProgrammingLab and Codecademy. Findings indicate that online systems have to be carefully designed if they should attract the digital natives generation. Some important design factors for self-learning systems found in this study are: unambiguous exercises, clear and well-formulated feedback, user-friendliness, GUI design, multi-modality, gamification and curriculum alignment. Interesting extension of user-friendliness is if the programming exercises have multi-lingual descriptions and if the online systems might be adapted for students with different learning styles. © The Authors, 2016.},

abstract={We discuss an educational development approach to embedding academic literacies instruction within disciplinary curricula. This developmental, embedded approach contrasts with the generic, extra-curricular, study-skills approach adopted in many universities. Learning Commons partners at York University, including librarians, writing instructors, and learning skills counsellors, collaborated with educational developers in the York Teaching Commons to design a program for course instructors and teaching assistants (TAs) who seek to improve their students’ academic literacies. This program includes interactive workshops focusing on strategies to facilitate the redesign of courses and assignments so as to give explicit attention to process-related practices and abilities involved in library research and writing. The academic theory underpinning this program is outlined along with its key content elements. We also describe how the program draws on SPARK (Student Papers and Academic Research Kit), an online resource, created by the York Learning Commons under a Creative Commons license with the goal of helping students succeed with written academic assignments. Feedback from instructors and TAs support that the program has played an important role in helping them to question their assumptions and redesign their teaching practice. © 2016 University of Wollongong.

abstract={European Universities are developing Bachelor degrees according the European Higher Education Area which focuses on the acquisition of a set of cross curricula and specific competences. The educational models are now centered on activities as a means for learners to achieve new competences improving their performance and skills. The purpose of this article is to analyze the online learner profile, through an initial assessment, in order to know if there is a gap between the expected competences and the real ones. This study focuses on some online courses with a set of specific Computer Engineering competences related to Math, Logic and Programming. Using a mixed methodology that combines a qualitative and quantitative data, the online learner profile is analyzed. The paper provides a detailed description about findings, seeking causes and providing guidelines, for improving the learning process based on competences. To conclude, it is introduced some recommendations and learning strategies to teachers in order to reduce the gap. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Industrial chemical processes are dynamic, in the sense that their variables are constantly changing with time; yet in most chemical engineering programs, the first and only course that focuses on dynamic behavior is Process Dynamics and Control (PD&C). In this single course, students are expected to acquire an understanding of dynamics (how processes change in time in response to perturbations), and to develop the skills for controlling dynamic chemical processes. The concepts in question are difficult to grasp from a textbook alone, neither are the required skills easy to acquire merely by solving math problems. At Rowan University, we have developed an active learning strategy for teaching PD&C that integrates seamlessly with class material and is conducive to a variety of learning styles. In this course, the students are required to complete an in-class active learning module each week. Each assignment begins with conceptual questions that help the students recall the theory underlying the topic and provide additional problem-solving practice. Next, the assignment presents a case study with sufficient information that the students are required to use to create a simulation of the process along with an appropriate control system, in MATLAB/SIMULINK. The simulations are then used to simulate and explore process responses to both prescribed and selfselected changes in controller parameters. This guided exploration approach is designed to enable students to develop a thorough understanding of the entire process of control system design, and students who have completed these modules indeed claim that these experiences have helped them build an intuition regarding how systems respond to changes and consequently how they are best controlled. In this paper, we describe these simulation-based guided explorations and their effect on student learning experience in PD&C at Rowan University. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014.},

abstract={An active learning strategy that integrates the curriculum of aquaculture engineering at Del Mar University in Mexico was designed. Such strategy implies that the students develop MATLAB®codes to compute stoichiometric coefficients and balance chemical equations by algebraic methods. The most significant results of thisresearch are that the degree of learning about the fundamentals of balancing chemical equations was from average to high; and average development of the capacities that the student will need in their future work, was from low to average. It was also identified that students increased their creativity regarding troubleshooting. The percentage of students certified for cycle 2013 is 100% and 83.33% in the subjects of computing and general chemistry respectively.},

abstract={The COVID-19 global pandemic forced institutions of higher education to adapt quickly to virtual connection platforms to maintain ties with their learners. After transitioning to virtual programming, the number of participants in our lifelong learning program more than quadrupled. As a member of the Age-Friendly University (AFU) global network, we saw this as an opportunity to continue expanding our age-inclusivity efforts and capitalized on this engagement by inviting attendees to participate in a brief online survey related to several of the AFU principles. Respondents requested, although not exclusively, continued virtual access to programming. Results emphasized the need for flexible and diverse access points, supported by age-inclusive campus infrastructure, for continuity in respondents engaging with the university post-pandemic. Our path forward is discussed, highlighting successful strategies by other AFU global partners. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Technical progress and social transformation processes require lifelong learning in different spaces and formats. This leads to new developments and challenges in education with regard to competency-based learning and recognition practices, especially as educational biographies become increasingly diverse and extensive repetitions of qualifications should be avoided. Until recently, a common assessment strategy for previously developed competencies has not been established in higher education. In this study, competencies expected in German vocational and higher educational programming training were identified, compared and evaluated with regard to equivalence. The methodological approach started with an extensive review of general frameworks and curricula, before competency descriptions and analyses of reference documents of German vocational and university programming education were gathered and systematically compared. As part of the iterative design process, a comparison matrix was developed, and common features along with gaps and overlaps of competencies were identified. Even though both educational tracks pursue different goals, they share a great number of expected programming competencies. In the context of lifelong learning, the proposed process can be utilized for improving the permeability and recognition practises in both vocational training and higher education. © 2022 ACM.},

funding_text 1={Computing competencies can be acquired in vocational training and at university. However, these institutions differ with regard to objectives and organization. While vocational training aims at professional action competency [2, p. 16], study programs are intended to enable students to work scientifically and responsibly [13]. Nevertheless, academics have vocational competencies and vocationally trained persons have competencies relevant for academia. Moreover, higher education is directed and financed by the state, while vocational training is mainly supported by the economy.},

abstract={The article aims to demonstrate the impact of neuroscience as an instructional strategy on student learning. This was an experimental research with a pre-experimental design that used a sample of 60 students on the Mathematics 1.0 course of the first cycle of the Continental University in the Academic period II - 2021. Significant contrasts were found between the results obtained before and after the application of the designed instructional guide, since the T value obtained is related with a significance level lower than 0.01, confirming the research hypothesis. When evaluating the effect of the application of the instructional guide with neuroscience as a strategy, it is shown to favorably affect the learning of students of the Mathematics 1.0 course of the first cycle of the Continental University, strengthening the entire learning process so that these can become meaningful. Therefore, it is recommended to continue implementing the instructional guide in all higher education courses without being limited to a single course as in the present study, as well as continue researching on the subject with larger samples. © 2022 Society for Research and Knowledge Management.

abstract={Background: Recent research in online settings reports that supporting self-regulated learning (SRL) strategy use could lead to greater online academic success. A growing number of studies have started to investigate SRL supports in online environments recently, which indicates a great interest in this matter. Though several systems for automatic assessment of programming have been developed, there is hardly any study that has investigated how an automated assessment tool for distributed programming could facilitate students' SRL strategies. Objectives: This study examined the ways our online Distributed Systems Laboratory (DSLab) tried to enhance students' SRL strategies in an authentic long-term online educational experience. Methods: We applied an experimental research design, involving 111 university students who performed a programming assignment using DSLab. A customized questionnaire was used to collect data from all students. Results and Conclusions: The statistical analyses revealed that DSLab tool managed to facilitate students' cognitive and meta-cognitive strategy use to a certain extent and critical thinking strategy use to a fairly large extent. Implications: Though more experimental results are needed to delve more deeply into these findings, this study provides relevant implications for online distributed (or general) programming course teachers who seek to increase students' SRL strategies in this field. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={The problems of contemporary IT specialists' training in terms of the high requirements to their computational thinking skills as well as the urgency of raising their motivation to mastering algorithmization and programming are discussed in the paper. It is emphasized by the authors that initial university courses should focus pre-service IT-specialists on the deep understanding of an algorithmic nature of any coding task, to realize basic characteristics of the algorithms, to understand their role in modern software development. Due to the contemporary demands, programming should rest on algorithms building and has to be a part of lager scale experiences in order to realize its full potential. One of such experiences offered by the authors in the paper is involving the students into specially arranged activity focused on efficient game algorithms creation and simulation of the tournament between the algorithms. The offered activity is elaborated based on the applying the gamification elements into the learning process. Basing on the core gamifiaction principles, there were thought over and arranged an activity involving the students into the creation of gamified products. In our case, the gamified product which the students had to develop in the process of learning of algorithmization and programming was the software platform which enables a computer simulation of the tournament between the different game algorithms which realize winning strategies. The peculiarities and the stages of the said activity are covered in details along with the description of the final software product. Analyzing the described functionality of the computer simulator of the algorithms tournaments based on the gamification ideas, we can emphasize its significant didactic facilities in the context of its using for IT-specialists training. In particular, the developed gamified product was probed in the process of other students' mastering algorithmization and programming as well as of the schoolchildren training during summer IT schools. The prospects of the research are outlined in the lines of using the obtained results for holding the empirical research for the verification of offered activity impact on the results of IT-specialists training. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

abstract={—Computational thinking skill is one of the essential abilities to be learned and perfected by students of this century. Studies have shown that in the teaching and learning of programming courses, discussion and problem-solving techniques have been widely used. However, studies based on the suitability of such teaching techniques for the development of the computational thinking skills of students are, however, lacking. In this context, this research was conducted to define the teaching techniques used by university lecturers when teaching a computer programming subject and to explore how the techniques can influence the development of the computational thinking skills of students. This research was based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches involving a semi-structured interview and a survey method, respectively. The research sample consisted of eight (8) university lecturers recruited from several Malaysian public universities, who had been teaching computer science to undergraduates. The results showed that in teaching computer programming, a majority of the respondents used discussion and problem-solving methods, with each assisting students to gain computer programming skills and learn certain components of computational thinking. As such, it is recommended that teaching practitioners incorporate the discussion and problem-solving techniques in the teaching and learning of programming courses. The incorporation of such strategies will help students develop good computer programming and computational thinking skills encompassing all the fundamental elements. The results also revealed that the respondents had no experience in using the metacognitive technique. As such, it is also proposed that future research should focus on this technique to investigate any possible effects that it may have on the growth of the computer programming and computational thinking skills of undergraduates. © 2021 by the authors.},

abstract={In recent years, instructional design has become even more challenging for teaching staff members in higher education institutions. If instructional design causes student overload, it could lead to superficial learning and decreased student well-being. A strategy to avoid overload is reflecting upon the effectiveness of teaching practices in terms of time-on-task. This article presents a Work-In-Progress conducted to provide teachers with a dashboard to visualize student self-reports of time-on-task regarding subject activities. A questionnaire was applied to 15 instructors during a set trial period to evaluate the perceived usability and usefulness of the dashboard. Preliminary findings reveal that the dashboard helped instructors became aware about the number of hours spent outside of class time. Furthermore, data visualizations of time-on-task evidence enabled them to redesign subject activities. Currently, the dashboard has been adopted by 106 engineering instructors. Future work involves the development of a framework to incorporate user-based improvements. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={Recent research has shown a great interest in supporting self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies in online learning. However, there is hardly any study that has investigated how students’ self-regulation of behavior could be promoted in online environments for programming learning and assessment, despite the proliferation of automated programming evaluation systems. This study examined the ways our online Distributed Systems Laboratory (DSLab) tried to enhance students’ self-regulation of behavior in a real long-term online educational experience. Participants were a sample of 111 university students who performed a programming assignment using DSLab. A customized questionnaire was used to collect data from all students. Our results revealed that DSLab tool managed to enhance students’ self-regulation of behavior to a large extent. Moreover, our study explored the correlation between students’ cognitive, metacognitive and critical thinking strategy use and their self-regulation of behavior. Since more and more programming course teachers seek to increase students’ SRL in general or distributed programming settings, our study provides significant insights into the evolution of automated assessment tools for supporting the development of students' SRL and behavior. © 2021, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.},

abstract={Many strategies have been proposed to mitigate programming plagiarism and collusion. However, the effectiveness can vary across learning environments due to different cultural and/or geographical backgrounds. A few specific studies have been conducted to provide a better picture about the matter in particular countries, but none of them focus on a developing country. This paper proposes a country-specific study for Indonesia, a developing country. Specifically, it summarizes student perceptions of programming plagiarism and collusion on 345 students from 16 universities. This paper also presents a list of strategies for mitigating programming plagiarism and collusion in six universities. Finally, it highlights remaining issues and recommends some practical solutions. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={This research paper examined theories, pedagogics, and contents explored by studies focusing on promoting computational thinking (CT) in higher education institutions (HEIs). CT has become a fundamental approach to building problem-solving skills, which requires a thought process. The field of CT is generally still maturing, and the use of CT as an approach to introduce freshmen to introductory programming courses in HEIs has been gaining scholars' interest in the recent past. To appreciate the strategies explored to promote teaching and learning of CT in HEIs; evaluate scholarly discussions, contributions, and potential impact of studies in this field, there is a need to ground the theoretical constructs that build the foundation for the field. A literature review methodology was adopted in this study. The data collected from the Web of Science, the Scopus, ACM, and ProQuest databases were analyzed to provide answers to the research questions. The findings from this study suggest that constructionism and constructivism are the prevailing learning theories explored by scholars in this field to deploy CT in HEI. Additionally, the study revealed that activity-based learning, problem-based learning, automatic assessment-based learning, and self-regulated or self-reflective learning are the prominent pedagogies used by educators. These findings provided a strong foundation for research in this growing field. Besides, the findings also create an opportunity for positioning CT in HEI's educational curriculum regarding how CT should be taught in that context. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The learning of programming is a complex process that may lead to high failure and dropout rates. Pair Programming is a software development technique that involves two individuals working side-by-side using the same computer. It has proven to be helpful in the process of programming learning. This paper analyses pair programming’s acceptance and assessment in novice programming university courses considering participants’ gender, previous programming experience and programming enjoyment. The participants were 80 students from three different cohorts enrolled in the IT undergraduate program at a Mexican State University. We designed and administered a questionnaire to collect data after the pair programming exercises were performed. For data analysis, we used SPSS 24, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis and Jonckheere-Terpstra statistical techniques. Descriptive and comparative results showed a significant increasing monotonic trend in the acceptance of Pair Programming as students’ preference towards programming increased (standardized statistic = 3.20, p = 0.00, Kendall’s b = 0.30, p = 0.001). There were no other statistically significant results. We found Pair Programming helpful and easy-to-implement in university courses. Students, on the other hand, positively accepted and assessed this learning approach. We recommend Pair Programming adoption in university courses as part of a broader strategy to engage students in the effective learning of programming. © 2021},

abstract={Active learning techniques surpassed traditional teacher-centric approaches owing to their benefits of better learning from the stakeholders. The selection of a specific learning strategy varies from one course to another for productive results. Many students face difficulties in understanding programming subjects especially when it comes to applying it practically for application developments, since the curriculum permits only a certain number of specific programs to be implemented and some courses will have only theoretical subjects without a practical component. Thus, it becomes a need of the hour to make students productive in order to be confident in applying concepts learnt to the application development. The proposed method of applying a combination of project based learning involving collaborative learning will prove to be an effective platform for the students to enhance their design & development skills. This experimentation has been applied to a total of about 420 engineering students and the average performance in the university examinations as well as their demonstration/oral presentation, viva answering skills are considered as metrics for measurement. Apart from this, students’ ability to face challenges is gauged through their ability to excel in placement drives for selection to various companies. This approach has resulted in a significant improvement in students’ performance in the university examinations with upto 54% of the students securing higher grades. Apart from this, it has been estimated that there is an improvement in placement rate of upto 10 - 15% along with increase in no. of offerings for the individual students. © 2021, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology.

abstract={Campus partnerships are an increasingly common and dynamic entity on college campuses. To successfully achieve institutional goals, campus partners must collaborate and create communities of practice. Open educational resources (OER) is a rapidly growing area in higher education due to the increasing costs of attending college and increased student debt. By providing access to OER, colleges are supporting student success, increasing retention of students, and, most importantly, contributing to reducing students’ higher education debt. OER initiatives often fall under the purview of the academic library. While the library is an excellent place to start an affordable learning initiative, identifying pertinent campus partners and forming communities of practice will improve awareness of OER and increase OER adoption. This study utilized a survey to identify levels of current awareness and adoption of OER among faculty at a master’s comprehensive four-year public university in Pennsylvania. The goal was to provide a benchmark for assessing future progress. It also provided structure and a programming plan for a newly developed collaboration between the library, distance education, and Information Services & Technology. Survey results assisted the partnership in identifying ways to collaborate and implement strategies to increase awareness and adoption of OER on campus. © 2021, Johns Hopkins University Press.

abstract={We experimented with the viability of using Lego Mindstorms as an alternative approach to supplement the learning of Basic Programming among novice university students. The study captured reactions and responses from ten undergraduates who had no background in Programming and were facing difficulties coping with an introductory course in Programming. Four Lego Mindstorms units were deployed to examine the participants' problem-solving and computational thinking skills. Findings indicate a high positive response (t=3.88 and p =0.004 for Problem Solving; t=-4.13 and p=0.003 for Computational thinking) to the use of Mindstorms as a strategy to encourage higher-order thinking, a critical skill in learning Programming. Participants reported clarity in understanding computational thinking concepts and claimed to be better able to articulate problem-solving tasks when prompted using Mindstorms. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Pair programming is an approach where two programmers work to solve one programming problem sitting shoulder to shoulder on a computer. Several studies indicating numerous benefits of using pair programming as a teaching strategy exist. However, only a few of them take into consideration the mechanism followed for pair formation. With an aim to study the impact of pair programming on undergraduate students, we try to make the pairs compatible with a genetic algorithm-based approach. Using a genetic algorithm, the system ensures that every pair in the class gets a particular combination of skills and personality traits. We also developed a desktop application to assign programming exercises to students dynamically. To assess the efficacy of pair programming in introductory programming course, a formal pair programming experiment was run at Netaji Subhas University of Technology. The pair programming experiment involved a total 171 undergraduate students from a computer engineering course. At the end of the program, we assessed the programming abilities of every student. We also analyzed the impact of a genetic algorithm-based pairing mechanism. On the basis of assessments, it is observed that pair programming is a successful pedagogical tool for facilitating active learning of introductory programming courses. Responses to survey garnered from undergraduate students hint that the genetic algorithm approach leads to compatible pairs. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

abstract={Combine face-to-face classes with a gamified e-Learning platform, is a proposal in higher education that increases the commitment and motivation in the development of autonomous tasks. The present research shows the results of the application in the subject Programming I (P-I) of the Faculty of Engineering, Physical Sciences and Mathematics (FEPSM) of the Central University of Ecuador (CUE). For this, an explanatory study, with a quasi-experimental design with groups: Experimental (gamified methodology) and control (traditional methodology), is carried out. These results are discussed in seven semesters, during the years 2015 and 2019. In addition, surveys are applied to students who completed the gamification course to evaluate the gamification strategies applied. To determine if the proposal allows improving the academic performance of the students, differences between groups were evaluated using the t-Student test in the case of normality and the non-parametric U-Mann-Whitney test in the case of non-normality. The nine experimental groups who used the gamified methodology are compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test and the medium for k samples. It is concluded that the implementation of gamification strategies on a virtual learning platform not only influenced students' motivation in the development of autonomous tasks but also allowed better academic performance. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={This Work in Progress, Innovative Practice paper examines the implementation and preliminary results of a flipped classroom strategy in a computational modeling undergraduate course at a [nationality] midsize university. Previous work has discussed the potential of flipped classrooms to leverage active learning through the use of videos and other computer-based tools that encourage students to explore course content autonomously. This study explores how the tools and tactics used in the course, namely out-of-class readings and Jupyter notebooks, can be effective to engage students and foster learning. To that aim, the final study will compare the changes in perceptions and performance of two classes (Fall 2019 and Spring 2020) before and after students take the course. The perceptions part of the instrument focuses on students' self-efficacy and interest in programming. On the other hand, the performance part of the instrument asks students to explain the purpose of simple programs by examining the code. Preliminary results suggest that the flipped format implemented increases students' self-efficacy regarding programming tasks, particularly within students already interested in this computational modeling. These results align well with preliminary performance results, which suggest that the strategy implemented prompts more students to try solving the programming problems and provide explanations, yet not always complete or correct. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Asynchronous, online courses are being designed from face-to-face (F2F) versions to provide the flexibility to scale-up enrollment [3]. To support student success in large-enrollment online classes, it is important to design online courses with strategies that enhance student engagement, which impacts achievement due to the changes in the learning environment[1]. F2F course strategies that are known to engage students may not work for online formats, and engaging online students can be difficult as students often feel isolated and detached [2]. There are a limited number of studies that report on or compare course strategies for online students. Strategies that support student success in online course offerings are valuable for student engagement, especially for upper-level programming intensive courses in computer science (CS)[4]. We present an approach to redesigning the F2F version of a Web-based Application Design and Development course and developing its online offering. We incorporated 17 course strategies in both the F2F and online formats including, course structure/sequence, course book, online class discussion, study group discussion, and weekly activity. We conducted an IRB approved study to examine: How valuable do students find the course strategies to be for their engagement (dependent variable) in F2F and online formats (independent variables) of an upper-level on-campus undergraduate CS course? We utilized an experimental research design to conduct this study in a doctoral university with high research activity located in the south-eastern US during its Aug-Dec 2019 semester. There were 103 online students and 72 F2F students who were taught by the same instructor. To answer the above research question, we asked students in an end-of-semester survey to evaluate each of the 17 course strategies in terms of their engagement with the course and/or course topics using a 5-point Likert scale that ranged from "not valuable"to "very valuable". The mean and standard deviation (SD) value of five example course strategies are shown in Table ~\reftab:course-strategies for the students who completed the survey and consented to participate in the study. Independent t-tests were conducted to compare how the course strategies supported engagement in the F2F and online formats, and we found significant differences between course formats for some of the course strategies despite having no significant difference in terms of student learning. We found empirical evidence that students' perceived some course strategies, including course structure/sequence to be more valuable in the online format, while study group discussion to be more useful in the F2F format. Also, some strategies including weekly activity were useful in both the formats. Our results show how course strategies supporting student engagement can inform online, F2F, and hybrid courses design in CS, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to require online or hybrid instruction. Future work will consider analysis on student learning and engagement. Additionally, we will examine course strategies to create a stronger community in the online space, and to improve online engagement. © 2020 Owner/Author.},

abstract={Worldwide, many countries are implementing Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) instruction at the primary and secondary school level. This push for CS/CT instruction in younger ages increases the need for pedagogical practices, such as learning strategies, that are effective for a wide array of learners. However, research into strategies for young learners is relatively sparse, especially compared with strategies at the university level. This study aims to investigate a commonly used practice at the university level, diagramming, as a potential strategy for students in grades 4-8 (ages 10-15). Our hope is that diagramming can be added to a suite of strategies to support program comprehension in younger learners. © 2020 Owner/Author.},

abstract={Software is a vital resource for modern life. For software to be successful, programming skills are of the utmost importance. These skills are used both by programmers and also by systems analysts and designers during the phases of software development. Therefore, both technical and non-technical stakeholders within the software development process need to understand programming. Evidence from the researchers’ experience indicates that non-technical stakeholders perform poorly in programming courses. Given the lack of literature on the attitude factors influencing programming success by non-technical students, this study set out to determine the attitudinal factors influencing successful programming by non-technical (Commerce) and technical (Computer Science) students at a South African University. Using a descriptive survey design, a 50-question Likert scale survey was completed by 126 Commerce and Computer Science students in the Information Technology discipline. Both Commerce and Computer Science students demonstrated a positive attitude towards realising the usefulness of computer programming, however Computer Science students demonstrated a higher overall positive attitude. Furthermore, for Commerce students, performance was correlated with these factors: confidence in learning programming, usefulness of programming and effectance motivation in programming. Hence it is recommended that strategies be devised by lecturers and programming course designers to increase student confidence and effectance motivation in programming, which will result in better student performance. Introducing a problem-solving approach and pair-programming, developing targeted courses and an early use of visual programming environments have been suggested to improve the overall confidence of non-technical students. © 2020 Southern African Association for Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education (SAARMSTE).},

abstract={Teaching is always a challenging task, especially in the current fast-paced and changing world. Universities curricula and instructional practices should take into account growing and changing demands of both industry and students themselves. Given all these factors, a Lean Software Development course for third year BS has been developed and continues to evolve at Innopolis University, Russia. In the course, lean methods are used both for teaching lean software development skill, and for teaching Lean via other, not directly related to programming, collaborative tasks, i.e. writing a research paper. Besides, lean methodology is used by the course development team for course design. As a result, this approach helps not only to develop the theoretical and practical skills that students can apply in various spheres of life but also to engage the students and to maintain their attention throughout the course without any overload. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper describes how an Ontario school board's majority First Nation, Metís and Inuit (FNMI) student population influenced the direction and priorities of the board toward culturally responsive and well-being focused initiatives. Using culturally sustaining/revitalizing pedagogy (CSRP) as a conceptual framework, it explores the board's efforts to meet the socioemotional and identity needs of its FNMI students (and families) through investments in professional learning communities (PLCs) and targeted programming and technologies. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents findings from one case in a larger multi-year (2015–2017), multiple-case (10 school boards) study by a university research team that included the author. Thematic analysis was used to code interviews and focus groups conducted with over 40 administrators, educators and community partners in the board featured in this paper. Findings: The board's culturally responsive and well-being focused initiatives, while intended to support FNMI students' socioemotional success and sense of inclusiveness in schools, was inadequate at fostering and sustaining students' (and families') cultural survival and communal well-being. Practical implications: Findings offer practical ways that schools serving large populations of FNMI students might support students' identity development and self-regulation skills in schools while also serving as a cautionary example of strategies that do not sufficiently address student challenges that are the result of ongoing legacies of colonization. Originality/value: This study provides a distinctive example of a predominantly FNMI school board that, in recent years, has prioritized student well-being and identity development over achievement. It provides insight into the transformative possibilities and constraints of trying to support FNMI students' socioemotional healing and cultural sustenance in a colonized system. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={It is common to think of learning as the acquisition of knowledge by an individual learner. Starting a century ago, Lev Vygotsky developed a different perspective on learning, initiating a tradition of educational research whose momentum and influence continue to grow. One of Vygotsky's key principles is the general genetic law of cultural development that states that whatever skilled cognition that individuals carry out within their own minds is preceded by homologous activity carried out by a social group of which this individual was a part. In linking the individual and society through this law, learning is not simply a matter of the acquisition of domain knowledge. Rather, it is a cyclic process by which a social group, in its functioning through joint activity, leads to individuals taking into themselves (i.e., internalizing) the social forms of activity. In this article, our goal is to explicate Vygotsky's genetic law and demonstrate its utility for yielding novel insight into computing education. We provide an extended illustration of the use of Vygotsky's law in examining a teacher and students in a university setting write code together during a class session. What our analysis reveals is that the teacher and students together enact a sequential, rule-based, and dialogical process of problem decomposition and code writing far different from the plan and schema-based models for programming that have emerged from prior research focused on the individual student and their cognitive strategies and structures. We provide commentary on implications of the genetic law for both research and practice in computing education. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.},

abstract={Employers are implementing various strategies to improve construction students' interests in residential construction careers to address workforce shortages. In order to advance construction students' learning experiences and residential career interests, the National Housing Endowment, National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), and True Homes USA, awarded a $100,000 grant to a historically black college/university (HBCU). The goal is to strengthen industryuniversity collaborations between residential construction organizations and the HBCU through an NAHB - Residential Construction Certificate Program, which includes NAHB memberships, scholarships, educational programing, and networking opportunities. Key NAHB program components include: (1) Residential construction modules in construction courses; (2) Travel and participation in NAHB International Builders Show (NAHB-IBS); (3) NAHB student organization; (4) Recruitment; (5) Scholarships; (6) Residential construction employment; (7) Field trips; (8) Professional development sessions; (9) NAHB student competition team for national NAHB four-year universities competition; (10) Residential construction certificates; and (11) Program evaluation and reporting. Drawing from foundational principles in professional career identity development, the purpose of this research was to gain insights into the residential construction learning experiences of HBCU-NAHB program participants. This limited case study approach involves the authors' experiences, NAHB program data analysis, and the administration of two self-reporting surveys with open-ended questions to gain insights into HBCU students' learning experiences as they participated in various components of this NAHB program. Thematic data analysis involves coding, categorization, and descriptive statistics. Also, the best practices, challenges, and lessons learned from the NAHB program are described. Results indicated that students' had gained residential construction knowledge and career interests. Positive experiences included increased understanding of the technical and managerial aspects of residential construction, real-life industrial experiences, professional development, development of soft skills, improved sense of belonging, and lowered financial burden through scholarships and internships. The few negative experiences included long travel times, new group discomfort, and feelings of inadequacy during NAHB competition team preparation. Seventy-five percent (75%) of students were interested in residential careers because of their desire to flip homes, prior residential construction experiences, NAHB activities, and passion to provide people with quality housing. Twenty-five percent (25%) of students were disinterested in residential careers because of prior commercial construction experience, higher salaries in commercial construction, and uncomfortable weather conditions at residential sites. Key challenges included difficulty in student selections and schedule conflicts. The proposed best practices model for industry-university collaboration had four components: (1) Initiation; (2) Establishment; (3) Engagement; and (4) Evaluation. The NAHB program has had positive impacts on construction students' learning experiences and residential construction career interests, as students feel better prepared for residential construction careers. This program described may be replicated at other universities, particularly at HBCUs, for improved residential construction learning and career interests. In the long term, this would increase the quantity and quality of residential construction professionals for 21st century built environments. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019},

abstract={A cyberlearning tool was developed to facilitate teaching and learning of software engineering courses. The tool, SEP-CyLE (Software Engineering and Programming Cyberlearning Environment), was developed by a publicly funded research university and is currently being used by at least seven other universities across the United States of America. The National Science Foundation (NSF) provided funding for the development and implementation of the tool. Since its initial development the scope of the tool has been expanded for use in other university level computer science courses. The three learning engagement strategies (LESs) that are an integral part of the tool are (i) collaboration, (ii) gamification, and (iii) social interaction. This paper focuses on the gamification strategy that was implemented in multiple sections of an introductory computer programming course at a university that was one of the locations for the multi-site project funded by the NSF. A study was conducted to determine students' perceptions of the cyberlearning tool and how it was implemented. Data for the study were obtained through interview and focus group sessions. The data were transcribed to extract the major ideas expressed by the students during the interview and focus group sessions. The findings are presented and discussed. The usefulness of the tool and the motivational aspects of the gamification strategy are explored as well. The paper provides suggestions from students for improving the tool and recommendations on how SEP-CyLE should be implemented in classrooms. The main contributions of this work are as follows: 1. The cyberlearning environment or tool that was developed with funding from the NSF was considered to be useful and user friendly by students who used the tool. 2. Gamification was considered by students to be motivating. 3. Students suggested that the tool should be used as an integral part of the course rather than as an add-on. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019.},

abstract={Making rational decisions for sequential decision problems in complex environments has been challenging researchers in various fields for decades. Such problems consist of state transition dynamics, stochastic uncertainties, long-term utilities, and other factors that assemble high barriers including the curse of dimensionality. Recently, the state-of-the-art algorithms in reinforcement learning studies have been developed, providing a strong potential to efficiently break the barriers and make it possible to deal with complex and practical decision problems with decent performance. We propose a formulation of a velocity varying one-on-one quadrotor robot game problem in the three-dimensional space and an approximate dynamic programming approach using a projected policy iteration method for learning the utilities of game states and improving motion policies. In addition, a simulation-based iterative scheme is employed to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed decision strategy can generate effective and efficient motion policies that can contend with the opponent quadrotor and gather advantaged status during the game. Flight experiments, which are conducted in the Networked Autonomous Vehicles (NAV) Lab at the Concordia University, have further validated the performance of the proposed decision strategy in the real-time environment. © 2019, Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This Research Full Paper explores automatic identification of ineffective learning questions in the context of large-scale computer science classes. The immediate and accurate identification of ineffective learning questions opens the door to possible automated facilitation on a large scale, such as alerting learners to revise questions and providing adaptive question revision suggestions. To achieve this, 983 questions were collected from a question answer platform implemented by an introductory programming course over three semesters in a large research university in the Southeastern United States. Questions were firstly manually classified into three hierarchical categories: 1) learning-irrelevant questions, 2) effective learning-relevant questions, 3) ineffective learning-relevant questions. The inter-rater reliability of the manual classification (Cohen's Kappa) was.88. Four different machine learning algorithms were then used to automatically classify the questions, including Naive Bayes Multinomial, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Boosted Decision Tree. Both flat and single path strategies were explored, and the most effective algorithms under both strategies were identified and discussed. This study contributes to the automatic determination of learning question quality in computer science, and provides evidence for the feasibility of automated facilitation of online question answer in large scale computer science classes. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Many countries and governments have laid down a national strategy for digitalization in schools with the intent to strengthen both pupils' and teachers’ digital competences. Computational Thinking (CT) can be regarded as a central ingredient of teaching and learning in the XXI century and should be part of these competences. The Swedish government has recently launched a national strategy for digitalization in schools stating that CT and programming should be integrated in many school subjects. Thus, one particular challenge that needs to be addressed is the one related to teachers' competencies and skills related to programming. Since 2016, The National Agency of Education has been working together with several Swedish universities on developing academic courses in the field of CT and programming for in-service teachers. One challenge we are exploring in this paper is the one related to teachers' perceptions and competencies related to programming. As part of our on-going efforts in the course “Introduction to Programming for Elementary Teachers” offered to in-service teachers we have analyzed data we collected representing teachers´ perceptions on CT and programming before the start of the course. We applied sentiment mining and word counting on 127 texts generated by the teachers. We examine their perceptions and cluster them accordingly in order to understand how teachers perceived different aspects related to CT education. By doing so, we lay down the foundations on how to tailor competence development efforts in this field so that they fit teachers´ need. We expect these efforts will lead to the development of a model enabling to identify teachers´ current perceptions in order to plan future actions that can increase their Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge. © 2019, The Education University of Hong Kong.

abstract={In recent years, there has been more of an emphasis on student success in colleges and universities. This paper is a comparison of student success, specifically course completion, in an introductory programming course. Three sections of the course were offered in two consecutive semesters. The same instructor taught each section each term. One section of the course was taught completely online; the other two sections were hybrid courses: a blend of online and classroom instruction. To help improve student success, some new strategies were added to the course in the second semester. Statistics show that course completion improved in the second semester, particularly in the online course section. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={We discuss teaching and learning situations that surfaced when computer programming and mathematics were brought together in a course where students write computer code to explore mathematics problems. Combining programming and mathematics creates a rich ecosystem which, on top of traditional mathematics activities (writing solutions, proofs, etc.), offers simulation and experimentation, invites discussions about structure, requires logic and testing strategies, and handles mathematics objects with an added feeling of reality. Focusing on novice and inexperienced programmers, we look for answers to the practice-oriented question, “How do students reason through their difficulties when using programming to explore a mathematics problem?” Following literature review and methodology, we build the programming model, which we use to study students' experiences as they approach a mathematical problem by writing computer code. Our research is based on analyzing students' in-class work and class notes, author's observations of students working on their computers, and his interactions with students in class and elsewhere. In the four case studies that we present we touch upon students' difficulties in working with complex conditional statements and recurrence relations. As well, we discuss cases where resolving a programming issue demands posing and answering mathematical questions. © 2018, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={New technologies as Fast Time Simulation (FTS) have great potential for teaching and learning in the maritime training environment and for use on board of ships. New concepts for training application of these innovative technologies have been developed at Maritime Simulation Centre Warnemunde MSCW/ISSIMS Institute in research projects. The innovation is to simulate the ships motion with complex dynamic models in fast time and to display the ships track immediately for the intended or actual rudder or engine manoeuvre, steered by a smart interface. These simulations allow for new type of manoeuvring design and optimisation of not only the next manoeuvring segment ahead but also for the following or even for series of manoeuvring segments. One obvious basic advantage in relation to conventional ship-handling training and navigators' preparation of harbour approaches is the easy creation, visualization and comparability of different manoeuvring strategies. The FTS software system consists of various modules for (a) Manoeuvring Design & Planning, (b) Monitoring & Conning based on Multiple Dynamic Prediction, (c) Trial & Training and (d) Replay and Assessment. Specifically the Planning module is the missing link in Voyage planning because it allows to develop the concept of specifically the manoeuvres in the unsteady motion segment after entering the moles up to the final berthing manoeuvre-and even to try out alternatives and limits of environmental effects. For practical application the new FTS-features were interfaced to the new Full-Mission and Desktop ship handling simulator Systems, configured by MarineSoft/benntec, based on Rheinmetall RME bridge simulator software ANS 6000. During recent research activities it became obvious that the new FTS technology has great potential for teaching and learning in the maritime education, both for lecturing and for simulator training in briefing and debriefing sessions of exercises, to make ship handling exercises more efficient and valuable for all parties. Experiences have been made how this new technology can be used to improve the simulator training in the Advanced Ship Handling Training course at the World Maritime University, Malmoe/Sweden [12], at the Maritime Simulation Centre of AIDA Cruises at Rostock/Germany and at the CSMART Centre for Simulator Maritime Training of Carnival Corporation at Almere/NL. In addition to ship handling training, the combination of ANS and FTS can be used in port risk assessments and in harbour and waterway design studies. Samples of application for briefing/debriefing and introduction lectures for simulator exercises specifically for typical cruises ships with Twin-Screw and-Rudder systems will be shown in the paper and at the conference. The potential of this technology for advanced maritime education and training will be discussed. © The Authors.},

abstract={In recent years, the educational issues have attracted more and more researchers' and teachers' attention. On the other hand, the development of data mining technology, provides a new method to extract the useful information from the complex educational data. In order to increase the chance of students to be awarded in discipline competition, it is better to select the proper students to take part in the proper discipline competition. Therefore, in this study, we collect the information of 164 undergraduate students as a case study. All students majored in Software Engineering in Zhejiang University of Finance and Economics. The Apriori algorithm with group strategy is used to find the relationship between the students' courses scores and competition awards. According to the results of association rule mining, we find that the students with higher scores of C# Development, Object-Oriented, Internet Web Design, Data Structure(C#), and Basic Programming will have a higher probability to be awarded in the competition. © 2018, Kassel University Press GmbH.},

abstract={Numerous studies have shown the effectiveness of collaborative active-learning pedagogies compared to traditional lectures across STEM fields. However, incorporating active learning in large classes presents unique challenges in stimulating student engagement and developing quality activities. A growing trend at universities is to create collaborative learning spaces (CLSs) that are purposefully designed and equipped to facilitate active learning. While some research has identified some effective learning strategies for CLS environments based on learning psychology, the success of individual activities is neither defined nor measured. This gap in knowledge is often met with a trial and error approach over numerous semesters. Activity adjustments are made solely based on the instructors' partial perceptions, whereas activity effectiveness is neither directly evaluated nor correlated to student performance. We present a novel measurement instrument called Fine-grained Evaluation of Active Learning (FEAL) for large CLS-based classes. FEAL can be quickly administered by preceptors to record key measures of activity success such as student engagement, activity difficulty, activity time, and associated lecture time. Other relevant information such as the concepts covered by the activity and the activity type are also recorded to be later cross-analyzed. FEAL can be applied to code exam questions and to assess student performance for the same concepts. We applied FEAL to a large freshman-level computer programming course with an enrollment of 200 students over the course of one semester. We present an overview of FEAL, its administration process within the CLS, and a detailed account of our evaluation methodology. We also highlight key lessons learned on the engagement and success achieved by individual activities, and outline planned improvements to in-class activities based on the obtained results. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.},

abstract={For many years, several countries have been committed to the introduction of computer science and, more recently, computational thinking in primary and secondary schools. Nevertheless, students of the first year of university often encounter difficulties in dealing with introductory courses in computer science and, in particular, programming. One of the main issues is related to the difficulty of thinking about algorithmic solutions, a skill that should be acquired from secondary school. A good knowledge of difficulties and the discovery of efficient strategies to overcome them are vital tasks. In this work, we discuss a first step in this direction. We have prepared a brief test focused on the algorithmic abilities and other processes potentially involved with it. The idea is to build a useful tool that can give assistance to the introduction of computational thinking skills in secondary school education. The test has been proposed to a small sample of secondary school students, aged 11 to 16 and its outcomes analyzed. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Teaching software development in environments that mimic industry practices is essential for teaching applicable real-word development skills. In addition, these delivery-based projects engage students in meaningful design work that encourages clear, sustainable code. The Software Factory has provided such projects and environment to students at Montana State University (MSU) since the 2014 academic year. This project aimed to explore the effectiveness of such instruction for high school students with limited programming experience. Students from Bozeman High School, Bozeman, Montana, were selected to work in a team with two MSU undergraduate students with the goal of creating an Android application over the course of a summer semester. In the process, these high school students were exposed to Java, sorting algorithms, version control, and software development practices in an industry setting. This experiential report describes the experiences of the team, the challenges and rewards of using this teaching method - the Software Factory - and how the program provided a real-world experience for high school students in the early stages of their computing education. In addition, after concluding two projects, the latter of which is described in this manuscript, the Software Factory staff plans to continue to reach out to high school students, and has been approached by four private high tech companies, and two startup efforts. The Software Factory complements the demand generation strategies program in the Computer Science Department by providing a unique approach to outreach. The goal of demand generation strategies is to promote and increase enrollment in computing-related career fields at higher education institutions in Montana. Although this is a work in progress, the outcomes of the Software Factory approach as it relates to K-12 students are demonstrable and have surpassed expectations. The high school students were excited about programming in the context of a real world setting, presented and were the subject of a Q&A session at a graduate level seminar, produced a working prototype of an Android application, and one of the participating students is now enrolled in computer science at Montana State University. The participating high school will select new students to participate in the summer of 2016. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.},

It enables educators to choose students to focus their supervision. The method considers the internal factors of students result in their learning behavior. The learning behavior is extracted from learning logs which are automatically taken from the e-learning sites to study programming. The internal factors of individual students are figured out through the decomposition of their learning behavior with the non-negative matrix factorization. For 48 students of C programming course of Ritsumeikan University, the method showed predicted active students who can solve difficulties by themselves. Consequently, the educators can focus their efforts on students needing cares in a timely fashion. © 2016 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.},

abstract={In data mining, association rules mining is one of the common and popular techniques used in various domain applications. The purpose of this study is to apply an enhanced association rules mining method, so called significant least pattern growth for capturing interesting rules from students suffering from exam, family, presentation and library anxiety datasets. The datasets were taken from a survey among engineering students in Universiti Malaysia Pahang. The results of this research will provide useful information for educators to make more accurate decisions concerning their students, and to adapt their teaching strategies accordingly. Moreover, it can also highlight the role of non-academic staff in supporting learning environments for students. The obtained findings can be very helpful in assisting students to handle their fear and anxiety, and, finally, increasing the quality of the learning processes at the university. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={The emergence of Web 2.0 is pervading higher education and has potentials to trigger enhancement in students’ learning. In this digital age, colleges and universities could take advantage of the new ways that students are communicating with one another by adopting Web 2.0 in learning through the lens of connectivism. This paper describes the utility of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis in validating the adoption of Web 2.0 through connectivism questionnaire which consisted of 62 items. This survey-based study explored 195 students’ use of Web 2.0 technologies and tools in learning programming. Five viable factors with 24 items were extracted from the principal component analysis procedure with normalised varimax rotation in which the factors were labeled as diversity, openness, autonomy, interactivity and self-regulated strategies which are consistent with the theory. 22 items were retained and rather substantiated for the construct validity of connectivism measurement model with slight modifications to enhance the integrity of the model. Interestingly, the five-factor model of connectivism suggested that the model was adequate for the second-order factor investigation. The foregoing psychometric properties via both factor analytical procedures somewhat corroborate the practicality of connectivism measurement model for further investigations. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.

abstract={Use of high-level scripting languages to solve big data problems has become a mainstream approach for sophisticated machine learning data analysis. Often data must be used in several steps of a computation to complete a full task. Composing default data transformation operators with the standard Hadoop MapReduce runtime is very convenient. However, the current strategy of using high-level languages to support iterative applications with Hadoop MapReduce relies on an external wrapper script in other languages such as Python and Groovy, which causes significant performance loss when restarting mappers and reducers between jobs. In this paper, we reduce the extra job startup overheads by integrating Apache Pig with the high-performance Hadoop plug-in Harp developed at Indiana University. This provides fast data caching and customized communication patterns among iterations for data analysis. The results show performance improvements of factors from 2 to 5. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={An evolutionary process that is currently taking place in the software industry is the shift from developing applications from scratch to discovering and assembling services published in the Internet. This has given birth to a new computing paradigm called service-oriented computing (SOC). We investigated whether simplifying and automating tasks inherent to SOC-based development, while exploiting systems engineering students' experience in earlier paradigms, namely object orientation, reduce the cognitive effort needed to learn SOC. The study involved 38 undergraduate students plus 7 postgraduate students from 4 universities, which attended a course about SOC development models and technologies. Then, they were asked to develop a real-life service-oriented application using two alternatives, namely existing SOC libraries and a software support of our own named EasySOC. EasySOC promotes using common object-oriented design patterns to structure service-oriented applications, facilitates service discovery, and hides many technological details from users. The students were surveyed about their perception on both alternatives using a Likert-based questionnaire. Results show that the students, who had no previous experience in service-oriented notions before the experiment, perceived that EasySOC allows focusing on essential aspects of the paradigm while concealing accidental aspects, and provides adequate support and guidance to bridge the gap. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Transforming the mental health system into a recovery oriented, integrated system of care requires a psychiatric work force that understands the relationship between recovery processes and community living. Fellowship programs in public and community psychiatry contribute to this transformation by educating psychiatrists about recovery, system dynamics, leadership, effective administration and community involvement. This paper describes a novel approach to fellowship programming that accomplishes these aims through an organizational strategy that emphasizes community engagement. After describing the administrative background for the program, we describe how the content curriculum and teaching process focus on the engagement of community members - both service users and service providers - as participating faculty. The faculty includes over 100 consumers, family members, advocacy group representatives, clinicians, and administrators. We present evaluation data obtained from 45 of the 100 community and university faculty who participated in the first 2 years' of the fellowship and conclude with a critique and recommendations for further progress in community engaged fellowship training. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={To enhance students' learning motivation and learning interest, scholars have attempted to incorporate game-based learning (GBL) into courses to improve conventional teaching which is mostly carried out using textbooks, presentations, or videos. However, one-tier tests were mainly adopted in previous GBL, meaning that it was difficult to identify whether students answered questions correctly by understanding knowledge or merely guessed the correct answer. Such tests also make it difficult to provide adequate feedback and guidance during the learning process. In order to solve this problem, a two-tier test-based digital gaming approach (TT-DGA) developed using RPG Maker was proposed in this study. It not only provided students with a more interesting way to learn art and view world-famous artworks in the game, but also introduced a two-tier test in the learning process to help students gradually construct professional art appreciation knowledge. To explore the effects of this approach, a total of 62 university students who took an elective art course were recruited in the current study. A quasi-experimental design was employed and the course was conducted physically during the Covid-19 pandemic. One class was the experimental group which adopted the TT-DGA for learning, while the other class was the control group which adopted the conventional gaming approach (C-DGA). The results showed that the TT-DGA could significantly enhance students’ learning achievement of art appreciation, learning motivation, learning attitudes, and flow experience. Based on the behavioral analysis, students in the experimental group were more active than those in the control group in terms of reading art history materials, watching videos, engaging in tests, and playing the game again. Finally, the interview results uncovered that the two-tier test could help students conduct self-inspection, confirm the accuracy of their understandings of knowledge, and correct misconceptions, and that DGBL made the art course more interesting. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In recent years, the inclusion of computational thinking in education has become very important. This is a response to the needs of the evolution of our society and the skills demanded in students to obtain practical and integrated training. For this reason, the educational inclusion of these types of practices, strategies, and skills has been the subject of study in recent years. However, it is equally important to prepare and analyse the initial training of future teachers in this area. This research paper presents an empirical experience in which the degree of development of skills associated with computational thinking in preservice primary teachers is examined. For this purpose, programming practices with Scratch were carried out with a total of 149 students of primary education university degrees as part of their training in mathematics education. An experiment was designed for a control group and an experimental group with initial and final measurements using a validated diagnostic instrument consisting of 30 questions associated with computational concepts and their application: a computational thinking test. The result of the experience is positive, as a more significant improvement was observed in the experimental group, which was also accompanied by the impressions, provided by participants, that point in a positive, useful, and practical direction in terms of the development of this type of educational practice being relevant enough to introduce to the teaching and learning process of mathematics. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={This study proposed combining problem-based learning (PBL) with different collaboration learning strategies in flipped classrooms to improve learners’ learning motivation and learning outcomes. The main idea was to design a teaching process based on the concept of flipped classrooms. The proposed method was adopted to design learning objectives, learning content, and group activities, thereby forming new teaching strategies for developing students’ independent learning, logical thinking, problem-solving skills, learning outcomes, and learning motivation. We used the C# programming language as the learning target and recruited 96 students from a first-year class of the Department of Information Management of the Southern Taiwan university of Science and Technology as participants. During the experiment, the participants were divided into an experimental group with heterogeneous subgroups and a control group with random subgroups, and pretest and posttest data obtained during the programming course were used to evaluate the learning effects of the proposed teaching strategies. In addition, a questionnaire was used to explore learning motivation through three aspects: flipped classroom, PBL, and collaborative learning. The results of this study indicated that the proposed teaching strategies improved the participants’ learning outcomes. The experimental group exhibited higher improvements in learning outcomes than did the control group. Significant results were obtained for all the items of the adopted questionnaire. Thus, the participants provided positive ratings to the flipped classroom model designed in this study. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Software reuse has potential for educational purposes since it uses decomposition and abstraction, two necessary skills to learn programming. Software reuse techniques require abstractions that are not obvious to students or even to professionals. Taking advantage of these techniques, students can learn computer programming in a productive and organized way. This paper proposes to use the Software Product Line (SPL) reuse technique as a strategy for learning to program industrial robots with the Arduino platform. First, the paper explains SPL construction and application with first-year university students. The SPL proposes abstractions close to the industrial robots domain with a simplified variability. The paper uses the case study method to show the feasibility of using the SPL approach in a learning environment. In this evaluation, students reused 38% to 43% of the total code needed to program the robot. It represents an improvement in the time it takes students to program industrial robotics solutions facilitating their learning. In addition, the paper unveils some limitations related to usability, specific knowledge, and some exploitable technologies. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={This paper investigates the simplification of programming for non-technical university students. Typical simplification strategies are outlined, and according to our findings CT courses for non-technical students typically address learners from different faculties, providing generic and basic knowledge, not specifically related to their major. In this study, we propose instead a hermeneutic approach to simplify programming, in which we aim at clarifying the problem-solving aspect of programming, addressing computational problems that are specific to their studies and leveraging on learners’ preunderstanding of the digital media they have experienced as users. The practical counterpart of our theoretical approach is a minimalistic Python multimedia library, called Medialib, that we designed to enable university students with a non-technical profile to create visual media and games with short and readable code. We discuss the use of Medialib in two empirical case studies: a collaboration with the university of Kyushu in Fukuoka, Japan, and a coding module for Media Studies students at the University of Southern Denmark. Furthermore, we use Notional Machines to attempt a comparison of the simplicity of learning tools for programming, and to ground our claim that Medialib is “simpler” for learners than other popular approaches. The main contribution is a hermeneutic approach to the simplification of programming for specific contexts that combines the hermeneutic spiral and notional machines. The approach is supported by a tool, the Medialib library; the two case studies provide examples of how the approach and tool can be deployed in beginners in CT courses. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany and Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V.},

abstract={Mechatronics is a hard interdisciplinary subject, which requires a tight synergy of mechanical and electrical knowledge. This paper presents a novel modular approach to teaching mechatronics subjects using the bond graph in LabVIEW. LabVIEW can provide an industrial environment that connects graphical and analytical aspects. The background of the mechatronics students is divided into two directions: mechanical and electrical. During the research, these two directions share a common part, which is the bond graph. The bond graph is a novel hybrid method to connect the mechanical and electrical parts. The bond graph is an efficient technology to teach mechatronics subjects, and it is easy to understand for the students. A modularity teaching method has been developed for undergraduate and master's students at the engineering faculty, University of Debrecen. For the undergraduates, the focus is on the fundamental models, with the goal dedicated to applied technology and linear system. For the master's stage, students will learn more complex controller systems because of the modular learning strategy that adds some modules to the basic models. A DC motor is modeled for the demonstration in the paper under the Lab View programming environment. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Aim/Purpose To gain insight into the opinions and reviews of Malaysian university students regarding e-learning systems, thereby improving the quality and services of these systems and resolving any problems, concerns, and issues that may exist within the institution. Background This exploratory study examines the students’ perceptions of e-learning in Ma-laysia based on Sentiment Analysis (SA) to gain a clear insight into their feelings about the quality of e-learning systems and related services in Malaysian univer-sities to determine whether these opinions are positive or negative. Methodology The data was collected from Twitter; the Full Archive Search API Premium v1.1 tire was chosen to access the tweets from November 1, 2019, to December 30, 2020. The R programming language library package “rtweet” was applied to ac-cess the search API and query the tweets. To classify students’ opinions, senti-ment analysis-based Machine Learning (ML) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) was utilized. Rapid Miner, a statistical and data mining tool, was used to determine the sentiment of tweets and the accuracy of the ML algorithm. After preparing the data, RapidMiner was used to pre-process and classify the final 1201 tweets based on sentiment, and National Research Council (NRC) word-emotion lexicon was used to detect the presence of eight emotions in the tweets. The confusion matrix is used to determine the classifier’s performance. Contribution This research provided evidence for the effective use of sentiment analysis as an indicator that may contribute to the development of educational systems, specifically, e-learning systems in Malaysian universities. Findings Based on the findings, the majority of students have a positive opinion about e-learning systems in Malaysian universities. Precisely, the results showed that 65% of sentiments were classified as positive and 35% as negative. Moreover, among the eight emotions, the majority of the tweets expressed a higher level of trust, anticipation, and joy. Recommendations for Practitioners The study findings could help classify the teachers’ strengths and weaknesses graphically based on the students’ positive and negative feedback. These find-ings would also help decision-makers and educationalists be more aware of stu-dents’ feelings (sentiments) and concerns. Thus, using social media sentiment analysis should be encouraged as a valuable source of information that may as-sist their educational decision-making, e-learning development, and perfor-mance evaluation. Recommendations for Researchers The findings may encourage other researchers to apply SA based ML approach and use Twitter as a data source to discover users’ opinions about certain issues in learning and teaching processes. Impact on Society Our study confirmed that social media data could provide valuable and support-ive information about educational systems and procedures in e-learning for ap-propriate decision-making regarding future development and strategies. Future Research Future work can experiment with other classification models and different ML classification algorithms as well as other feature extraction methods and com-pare the results to find the best accuracy that can improve the classification results © 2022, Journal of Information Technology Education: Research.All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Heterogeneous multicore processor systems, as one of the highlights of multicore processor systems, are widely loved by people for their high efficiency and low cost, and they have also become the most commonly used processor systems in embedded systems. In the process of research on heterogeneous multicore processor systems, system task scheduling is particularly important. A good task scheduling algorithm can give full play to system performance. In this paper, the intelligent approximation algorithm is applied to the task scheduling problem of heterogeneous multicore processor system, and the heterogeneous multicore processor system is obtained as a highlight in the multicore processor system. Relying on the characteristics of high efficiency and low cost, it is widely loved by people, and at the same time, it has become the most commonly used processor system in embedded systems. In the process of research on heterogeneous multicore processor systems, the system task scheduling problem is particularly important. A good task scheduling algorithm can give full play to system performance. Some commonly used heuristic task scheduling algorithms are insufficient in solving such problems. This paper combines the granularity-based wavefront parallel decoding algorithm and the fast fusion loop filter algorithm to apply pipeline parallel technology between pixels. Decoding reconstruction module and fast loop filter module realize the fusion of multilevel parallel decoding. Based on the multicore platform, a dynamic multiparallel scheduling algorithm is designed to realize two-way video real-time parallel high-speed decoding, which improves the core resource utilization rate and decoding execution efficiency of the multicore processing platform. This paper also designs an indicator collector, a read-write hit collector, and a cache block priority determiner to implement a dynamic generation strategy with low hardware overhead. Multimodal teaching has certain feasibility and effectiveness and can have a positive impact on the English reading motivation and English reading comprehension ability of university students. Multimodal teaching improves students' English reading comprehension ability, deepens students' understanding and memory of words, and broadens the scope of knowledge, which has a significant promoting effect. The research results show that multimodality can be applied to college English teaching, and it can achieve better results than traditional teaching methods. By comparing the test results before and after the test, there are obvious differences between the experimental class and the control class. Whether it is the paired sample T-test of the experimental class or the independent sample T-test of two teaching methods in two classes, it proves that the scores under the multimodal English teaching mode are higher than the traditional teaching mode. Multimodal classrooms provide students with many opportunities to participate in classroom activities and form a competitive learning atmosphere. This competitive learning atmosphere has become a driving force to promote student learning. Multimodal teaching methods help to cultivate students' independent and cooperative learning. In a multimodal classroom, many activities require cooperation and discussion among students. When they encounter difficulties, they can help each other, discuss with each other, and cooperate to complete tasks. Therefore, the multimodal teaching method will stimulate students' interest in learning, give full play to students' initiative, and improve students' English ability. © 2022 Yue Huang and Zheng Shu.},

abstract={Although there are different types of software resources—which in many cases favor a reduction in learning time—there are not too many options to develop a training simulator designed according to some particular real equipment. The case of the Engineering Equation Software is an effective tool that improves the learning of thermodynamics and the understanding of real thermodynamic cycles. In the present paper, an original programming procedure to improve the learning process of Marine Engineering students at the University of A Coruña (UDC) is shown. In particular, to test this learning procedure, an Operator Training Simulator is done by 117 students by the fusion of the contents of two subjects of the “Degree in Marine Technologies” of the UDC. The main advantage that this personalized simulator presents is confronting problems derived from equipment operation, thereby proving the necessary knowledge in operation based on the thermodynamic phenomena. The results showed that students who were trained with simulators showed a better understanding of the knowledge obtained. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

abstract={Nowadays, when the changes that appear in programming paradigms and in software process development methodologies are extremely frequent, teaching a Software Engineering related course has become a demanding task. To all these are added changes caused by the dynamics of the society and the traits of the current learners and how they learn. To cope with the challenges mentioned above, the paper proposes a complementary method for Project Based Learning in teaching two Software Engineering related courses, at undergraduate and master level at Babeş-Bolyai University. Its contribution is twofold: firstly, it frames a new pedagogical approach based on "Students Generating Questions"as a learning strategy, defined in a collaborative way. The approach is supported by an e-learning platform designed as smart learning environment. Secondly, it investigates through a quantitative and qualitative analysis, the students perceptions, their feedback and learning experiences on the use of applying this learning method. The results of the survey indicate that the proposed learning method helped students to better regulate their learning and to achieve their goals.

abstract={Engineering instructors often use physical manipulatives such as foam beams, rolling cylinders, and large representations of axis systems to demonstrate mechanics concepts and help students visualize systems. Additional benefits are possible when manipulatives are in the hands of individual students or small teams of students who can explore concepts at their own pace and focus on their specific points of confusion. Online learning modalities require new strategies to promote spatial visualization and kinesthetic learning. Potential solutions include creating videos of the activities, using CAD models to demonstrate the principles, programming computer simulations, and providing hands-on manipulatives to students for at-home use. This Work-in-Progress paper discusses our experiences with this last strategy in statics courses two western community colleges and a western four-year university where we supplied students with their own hands-on kits. We have previously reported on the successful implementation of a hands-on statics kit consisting of 3D printed components and standard hardware. The kit was originally designed for use by teams of students during class to engage with topics such as vectors, moments, and rigid body equilibrium. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and shift to online instruction, the first author developed a scaled down version of the kit for at-home use by individual students and modified the associated activity worksheets accordingly. For the community college courses, local students picked up their models at the campus bookstore. We also shipped some of the kits to students who were unable to come to campus, including some in other countries. Due to problems with printing and availability of materials, only 18 kits were available for the class of 34 students at the university implementation. Due to this circumstance, students were placed in teams and asked to work together virtually, one student showing the kit to the other student as they worked through the worksheet prompts. One community college instructor took this approach as well for a limited number of international students who did not receive their kits in a timely manner due to shipping problems. Two instructors assigned the hands-on kits as asynchronous learning activities in their respective online courses, with limited guidance on their use. The third used the kits primarily in synchronous online class meetings. We found that students' reaction to the models varied by pilot site and presume that implementation differences contributed to this variation. In all cases, student feedback was less positive than it has been for face-to-face courses that used the models from which the take home kit was adapted. Our main conclusion is that implementation matters. Doing hands-on learning in an online course requires some fundamental rethinking about how the learning is structured and scaffolded. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021},

abstract={There has been a worldwide surge in programming education initiatives for children and teenagers. In Brazil, this trend faces some challenges, namely inadequate infrastructure of most schools, notably public ones, that lack access to computers and tablets, and basic education curricular requirements not contemplating computer science concepts. This article reports on the five-year experience of an outreach project from a public university in Brazil. The project aims to promote computer science education and to teach programming to children and teenagers. Undergraduate engineering students who participate in the project as members engage in activities such as planning the courses and their schedules, creating partnerships with local schools and other educational projects, giving lectures, producing scientific research and educational materials, as well as promoting the project on social media. The courses use free online programming tools, Python, MIT App Inventor, and Arduino to cover fundamental concepts of programming and computational thinking. They vary approaches and tools according to the age range and available technological resources of the target audience. The use of unplugged activities means to assist in learning and to circumvent computer access problems. Furthermore, they serve for introducing basic programming concepts in classes and motivating students with dynamic activities. Over its five-year existence, the project has achieved its purpose, by reaching a total of 2639 students through 45 workshops and 94 courses. It has provided courses in eleven public schools, created two booklets and one app as free educational material, along with presented papers and posters in scientific conferences. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={To facilitate the teaching of robotics technology in higher education, a laboratory robot is needed. Using a laboratory robot, a teacher can discuss robot parts in more detail, both in electronics, mechanics, controllers, intelligence, and the principles of kinematic movement and robot dynamics. Unfortunately, a laboratory robot has a high price, a complex system, parts that are difficult to separate and software with a limited programming language. Many universities have to wait a long time to buy a laboratory robot. Even after buying it, it still gets complexity and language problems that are difficult to teach students. Therefore, there are several studies in the form of solving these problems. This study aims to create a simulator of a mobile robot. The GUI of the mobile robot, especially goal-seeking behavior, is designed. The robot maneuver uses differential drive wheeled mobile robot principles. The simulation tool uses the MATLAB programming language. Based on several simulation processes, it can be stated that the mobile robot simulation tools can work well. Some performance of control strategies can be analyzed using figures or numerical data resulted. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={This research paper presents a group project framework for a second-year programming course, which was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The framework offers well defined stages of the group project which allow students to work on their choice of a real-world problem, integrate their learnings from previous courses, and present a working solution. In the group project, students actively participate, reflect, and contribute to achieving the goals set in the learning objectives of the course. Our framework incorporates key features from Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory (1984) and principles of active learning from Barnes (1989) to achieve active and experiential learning through active supervision. The use of group projects as a teaching pedagogy is widely adopted in many universities. Students work together, develop a plan, and demonstrate their abilities in building on existing knowledge acquired from previous courses, and apply them appropriately for problem solving. Prior to the pandemic, it was the norm for students to work on their group projects together by meeting physically on campus. Key benefits of working together physically are having the support of one another and the ease of communication. With the onset of the pandemic, safe distancing measures, and restrictions put in place have made it challenging for students to work on group projects together. During the pandemic, many courses were forced to move online with limited face-to-face learning opportunities on campus. This posed great challenges to the faculty in terms of effective supervision of students and their project progress. To mitigate the challenges, we devised a flexible strategy that makes use of both technology-based and non-technological means for monitoring students' group project milestones. The faculty receives continuous updates from students as they work towards each milestone. These milestones serve as important checkpoints for students. Continuous checks at different milestones help the faculty adopt appropriate intervention measures as issues arise. The group project learning framework consists of three main stages, namely Group Formation, Scoping of the Project, and Group Solutioning. The framework is overlaid with Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory concepts to describe the learnings, milestones, and deliverables of each stage. Each of these stages adopts Barnes's principles of active learning to enable active participation, reflection, and contribution by students. We evaluated the success of this framework through a comprehensive student survey analysis. The survey asked specific questions to students on all stages of the group project and the overarching component of teamwork and working online. We also present our findings and lessons learned for improvements of the framework. We believe that our framework will be valuable to educators in computing programs that wish to adopt effective supervision measures for group projects. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Collaborative learning has grown more popular as a form of instruction in recent decades, with a significant number of studies demonstrating its benefits from many perspectives of theory and methodology. However, it has also been demonstrated that effective collaborative learning does not occur spontaneously without orchestrating collaborative learning groups according to the provision of favourable group criteria. Researchers have investigated different foundations and strategies to form such groups. However, the group criteria semantic information, which is essential for classifying groups, has not been explored. To capture the group criteria semantic information, we propose a novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach, namely using pre-trained word embedding. Through our approach, we could automatically form homogeneous and heterogeneous collaborative learning groups based on student’s knowledge levels expressed in assessments. Experiments utilising a dataset from a university programming course are used to assess the performance of the proposed approach. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The knowledge society demands new ways to develop the learning - teaching process, where Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) plays a major role with the use of educational technology as a didactic tool for the development of skills. The University of Informatics Sciences offers a degree in Informatics Sciences Engineering, which has Operations Research subject within the Applied Mathematics discipline. This program is in charge of developing in the students the skill of modelling problems of linear programming, necessary for a professional of this area. Through the review of semester reports, pedagogical observations, interviews and surveys applied to students and teachers; several insufficiencies were evidenced in the learning teaching process of this subject; that indicates a low level of skill development of modeling linear programming problems. For this reason, this research objective is to elaborate a didactic strategy that makes use of the ICT for contributing to the development skills to model problems from Operations Research course in students of Informatics Sciences Engineering. As part of the strategy, a set of actions were defined to be executed by students and teachers in each of the four stages developed: diagnosis, planning, execution and evaluation. In this stage, a group of indicators was defined to measure the level of the development of the skill, according to a three levels scale. A collection of exercises was also made to model linear programming problems to work in classes, according to the current socioeconomic context. Finally, the results of the validation of the strategy are shown, through a pre-experiment, and the application of Iadov’s satisfaction test. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This quantitative research aims at analyzing the impact of the Web Application for the Educational Process on Logarithm (AEL) through data science and machine learning (linear regression). The sample is composed of 29 students who studied the Basic Mathematics course in a Mexican university during the 2015 school year. The AEL presents the mathematical procedure on the use of the logarithm to find the time (number of years) during the application for a bank loan. The TPACK model allows the organization of the AEL through technological knowledge (PHP programming language), pedagogical knowledge (simulation strategy) and disciplinary knowledge (use of the logarithm in the field of financial mathematics). The results of machine learning with 50%, 60% and 70% training indicate that the AEL positively influences the assimilation of knowledge about the logarithm, development of mathematical skills and understanding of the theoretical concepts of the logarithm in the field of financial mathematics. Likewise, data science identifies three predictive models on the use of the AEL in the teaching-learning process. Finally, technology is transforming the interaction between the school content and students during the 21st century. © 2020 Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Teaching computational thinking for business students at the University level has been challenging because business students normally have little and/or heterogenic computer programming background. Also, there are very few literature that examines the alignment of appropriate teaching and learning theories/strategies with different levels of cognitive processes/learning outcomes for teaching business students computational thinking. This preliminary study is to address these gaps by proposing and exemplifying an alignment of six teaching and learning strategies with the six levels of the Bloom’s taxonomy of learning outcomes for teaching business students, with different computer programming background, Python programming at the University level. University lecturers could use these six proposed teaching and learning strategies as a guideline to design their course contents and materials for teaching business students Python programming at the University level. Further research direction was discussed. © 2020, The Education University of Hong Kong. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In Computer Science, and particularly in the context of Maker Education, students should try out new technologies (including coding) or craft techniques without fear of failure and in a playful way. Studies have shown that learning programming through tinkering appeals to boys more than girls. Taking that into consideration, tools and tasks can make a huge difference in an open learning and teaching environment. These observations are supported by the results of a pop-up-makerspace event for children and teenagers between the ages of 10 and 14. The “MAKER DAYS” for kids took place in the summer of 2019 at Graz University of Technology and attracted 132 children for 4 days. The main goal of the event was to enable authentic learning experiences and to try out new technologies. Participants could choose from a variety of activities, including digital fabrication with 3D-printing, soldering, programmed embroidery, coding, and robotics. Five workshop areas focused on coding skills. The “hAPPy-Lab” acted as a starting point to practise Computational Thinking as well as to learn the basics of coding by developing an app. For example, participants with minor or no coding skills, who wanted to create an embroidery design or use a microcontroller, were asked to visit the hAPPy-Lab first. The hAPPy-Lab implemented a carousel activity and the participants were supported by peer tutors. In this paper, we present the didactic and educational environment of the hAPPy-Lab and suggestions for a similar environment in school. Copyright © 2020 for this paper by its authors.

abstract={Object-oriented programming skill is important for the software professionals. It has become a mandatory course in information science and computer engineering departments of universities. However, it is hard for novice learners to understand the syntax and semantics of the language while learning object-oriented programming, and that makes them feel frustrated. The purpose of this study is to build an object-oriented programming assistant system that gives syntax error feedback based the variation theory. We established the syntax correction module on the basis of the Virtual Teaching Assistant (VTA). While compiling codes, the system will display syntax errors, if any, with feedbacks that are designed according to the variation theory in different levels (the generation, contrast, separation, and fusion levels) to help them correcting the errors. The experiment design of this study splits the participants, who are university freshmen, into two groups by the S-type method based on the result of a mid-term test. The learning performances and questionnaires were used for surveying, followed by in-depth interviews, to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed assistant system. The findings indicate that the learners in the experimental group achieved better learning outcomes than their counterparts in the control group. This can also prove that the strategy of using the variation theory in implementing feedback for object-oriented programming is effective. © Kassel University Press GmbH.},

abstract={Knowledge in Computer Science (CS) is essential, and companies have increased their demands for CS professionals. Despite this, many jobs remain vacant. Furthermore, computational thinking (CT) skills are required in all contexts of problem solving. A further serious problem arises from the gender disparity in technology related fields. Even if tech companies want to hire women in technology, the number of women who enterthese fields is remarkably low. In high schools with no technical focus, most teenagers acquire only low-level skills in CS. The consequences are misleading preconceptions about the fundamental ideas of CS and stereotype-based expectations. Consequently, many teenagers exclude computing from their career path. In this paper, two promising concepts to overcome these challenges are presented. In 2018, a voluntary gamified lecture “Design your own app”, held at the University of Graz for students of all degree programs, was introduced. The course attracted over 200 students and received positive evaluations. This led to the second concept. In January 2019, a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) with the title “Get FIT in Computer Science” was designed and launched in August 2019 on the platform iMooX.at with the goal to provide a basic introduction to different concepts of CS, including programming and the application of game design strategies. The MOOC was accompanied by an offline lecture, following the principles of flipped classroom and inverse blended learning. For evaluation purposes, we collected data at three stages: 1) during the MOOC, 2) during the offline lecture, and 3) two months after the lecture. The results showed that the MOOC framework was a promising approach to support and motivate at least a certain group of first-semester students, especially those who had no prior knowledge in CS. © ACPIL.},

abstract={Background: In universities, the course of Java programming is widely offered.It con-tains many contents and is practical. Therefore, learning Java programming is considered to be a diffi-cult and challenging task for beginners. That is to say, students must learn a lot of programming skills in order to effectively master the course. However, it is often reported that the result of teaching Java programming is poor, mainly reflected in the stereotyped teaching methods, lack of project development experience and so on. In order to investigate and solve these problems, many educational experts have conducted in-depth research about it. CDIO (Conceiving-Designing-Implementing-Operating) engineering education model is the latest achievement of engineering education reform in recent years. It is a life cycle from product development to product operation as the carrier, which enables students to learn engineering in an active, practical and comprehensive way. For the problems in Java programming course, the concept of CDIO engineering is introduced to solve them. Methods: Firstly, the research status of Java programming course and the application of CDIO model were analysed. Secondly, the current situation of learning was analysed by means of questionnaire sur-vey. At the same time, the main problems existing in the current teaching project were listed. Follow-ing this, the questionnaire method was used to analyse the current learning situation of Java programming course. The ideas of CDIO engineering education and iteration mode were applied to Java programming course. From various perspectives, this paper makes a detailed analysis of the development methods and strategies of the new teaching mode. Finally, the teaching model was applied to the existing teaching process. The teaching effect of the model was verified by data statistics. Results: The experimental results show that the new teaching mode encouraged students to master programming knowledge as well as problem-solving strategies. Students' interest in learning has been increased and their comprehensive ability has also been improved. Compared with traditional teaching methods, teachers tend to adopt CDIO teaching methods. The data statistics of teaching effect include six aspects: learning initiative, learning interest, knowledge-related ability, communication ability and practical ability, practical skills and final examination scores. The final exam results also showed that students with the new method performed better than those being taught with the older teaching method. Conclusion: A new teaching model based on graded iteration and CDIO Engineering education mode is proposed for the problems existing in the teaching process of Java programming course. This paper creatively combines CDIO engineering ideas with Java programming course, and intro-duces the idea of hierarchical iteration. According to this idea, the knowledge structure of the course is put forward, and the teaching method of CDIO is adopted to attract students to study Java pro-gramming. The basic characteristics of the teaching mode are that the project is taken as the main line, the teacher as the leading role, and the students as the main body, so as to cultivate the students' comprehensive engineering ability. By strengthening the classroom teaching and practice teaching, the new model improves the Java teaching process, and enhances the teaching effect. The teaching practice proves that the new teaching model can mobilize the enthusiasm of students and improve the students' practical ability. It is worthy of popularizing. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={A key challenge facing nowadays universities is the growing attrition rate of computer studies students, attributed to poor academic performance. While extensive research has been conducted on how to enhance students’ performance in computer programming, fewer research investigates other computer courses, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. This paper addresses this gap by describing experiments that revealed some of the factors that influence a student’s overall academic performance at university through explanatory modeling. Our results showed that students’ background in mathematics and their performance in the Introduction to Information Systems course were key in determining performance. Unexpectedly, prior computer skills or secondary school grades had less impact. The strategies identified for enhancing students’ performance include an emphasis on building students’ mathematics background, providing a stringent teaching approach to foundational computing courses, re-structuring of courses in the computer program, and linking courses across the curriculum. Thus, explanatory modeling creates an opportunity to adopt a proactive approach to enhancing the performance of computer studies students. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={This study examines a pricing approach that is applicable in the field of online ticket sales for game tickets. The mathematical principle of dynamic programing is combined with empirical data analysis to determine demand functions for university football game tickets. Based on the calculated demand functions, the application of DP strategies is found to generate more revenues than a fixed price strategy. The other important result is the capacity distribution of tickets according to the football game intensity. Prior studies have shown that it is sometimes more profitable or football clubs to allocate a share of tickets to a retailer and earn a commission based on the sales, rather than selling the entire capacity of tickets by itself. This paper finds that in a high intensity game, where the demand is generally high, it is optimal for the club to sell all tickets by itself. Whereas, for less popular games, where there is considerable fluctuation in demand, the capacity allocation problem for maximized revenues from ticket sales, becomes a harder optimization challenge for the club. According to DP optimization, when the demand for tickets is relatively low, it is optimal for the club to retain 20–40% of the tickets and the rest of the capacity should be sold to online retailers. In the real world, this pricing technique has been used by football clubs and thus the secondary market online retailers like Ticketmaster and Vivid Seats have become popular in the last decade. © 2019 by the author.

abstract={This Research to Practice Ful1 Paper presents a study regarding applying cyclic learning strategy with a special focus on object-oriented programming and states our findings, emphasizing both the advantages and disadvantages.The research considers as a use-case the teaching activity in the Faculty of Computer Science of Babeş-Bolyai University. The analysis takes into consideration several disciplines that compass a set of interconnected teaching objectives and aspects: (1) fundamental concepts and mechanisms (F) defined by object-orientated programming paradigm, (2) design principles, heuristics, and rules (D) that act as strategies implied in object-oriented design, and (3) functional and nonfunctional requirements related to software architecture (A).The study is directed by a statistical analysis of the grades obtained by the students at different courses that treat the (F, D, A) aspects, and also the results obtained at the Bachelor's final exam that evaluates the level of the acquired fundamental knowledge. Their evolution and correlation during a period of several years are analyzed, and together with an analysis of the degree of absorption of the students in the IT industry form the base of the study. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={'Physical literacy' (PL) education-that is, teaching foundational skills, attitudes, behaviors and knowledge about lifelong involvements in physical activities, is an important aspect for health promotion among children. Universities have been playing a critical role by teaching future PL professionals. Additionally, various universities have offered university-based PL programming for neighborhood children as a way of public health promotion service and community engagement. However, this additional role of universities and the ways of promoting the quality of this type of health promotion service programming have not been investigated in the current research literature. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify the practicable strategies to enhance the quality of university-based PL programming for children from the perspectives of community stakeholders. Overall, 24 community stakeholders who held professional positions that are related to PL education participated in a 90-min focus group interview. This grounded theory study identified that university-based PL programming for children should be (i) inclusive, (ii) collaborative, (iii) welcoming and (iv) responsive. Practical suggestions and recommendations were also provided. This study has provided empirical knowledge to prioritize aspects for the future actions in planning and implementing university-based PL programming for children and informed for further cross-cultural comparisons amongst the perspectives of participants, university service providers and community stakeholders. The knowledge acquired from this research will also be translated to university service providers who operate similar type of health promotion service programming to the public. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={This paper explains the design of a prototype desktop and augmented Virtual Reality (VR) framework as a medium to deliver instructional materials to the students in an introductory computer animation course. This framework was developed as part of a Teaching Innovation Grant to propose a cost-effective and innovative instructional frameworks to engage and stimulate students. Desktop-based virtual reality presents a 3-dimensional (3D) world using the display of a standard desktop computer available in most of the PC labs on campus. This is a required course at this university that has students not only from the primary department, but from other colleges/departments as well. Desktop VR has been chosen as a medium for this study due to the ease-of-access and affordability; this framework can be visualized and accessed with the available computers in PC labs available in university campuses. The proposed research is intended to serve as a low-cost framework that can be accessed by all students. The concepts of 'computer graphics, modeling & animation', instead of being presented using conventional methods such as notes or power point presentations, are presented in an interactive manner on a desktop display. This framework allows the users to interact with the objects on the display not only via the standard mouse and keyboard, but also using multiple forms of HCI such as Touchscreen, Touchpad, and 3D Mouse. Hence, the modules were developed from scratch for access via regular desktop PCs. Such a framework helps effective pedagogical strategies such as active learning (AL) and project-based learning (PBL), which are especially relevant to a highly lab-oriented course such as this course titled 'Introduction to Animation'. Finally, the framework has also been tested on a range of VR media to check its accessibility. On the whole, this proposed framework can be used to not only teach basic modeling and animation concepts such as spatial coordinates, coordinate systems, transformation, and parametric curves, but it is also used to teach basic graphics programming concepts. Hence, instead of a touchscreen, the modules have to be developed from scratch for access via regular desktop PCs. Such a framework helps effective pedagogical strategies such as active learning (AL) and project-based learning (PBL), which are especially relevant to a highly lab-oriented course such as this animation course. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019},

abstract={This paper exhibits the learner sited in the zone of proximal development as it aimed to display the performance efficacy in the two levels of the zone of proximal development: the actual development level, where a learner performs independently, and the level of potential development, where a learner performs with the assistance of a more skilled individual. Execution viability in this study mounts learner experiences through the use of learning scaffolds and determine efficacy performance using a pretest and posttest scheme and the mean scores of a controlled and experimental course learning activities. The study employed descriptive-quantitative design to ascertain efficacy in learners' feat. The experimental method of research was employed across researcher-identified tracking phases. It consisted of student participants taking Computer Programming course under the 1st year level of the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology program curriculum and were purposely selected based on qualifiers. Learning scaffold approaches included human computer interaction in reference to user experience and usability of a university acquired learning management system as it presents how learners employ the application and assessment prove its efficiency. The study revealed that the utilization of scaffolding strategies was operative amidst the tracking phases as the competency of a learner results reflect incremental percentage frequency distribution in the learner-user experiences and considerably significant differences in the mean scores of a pre-test and post-test, and in the mean scores of the controlled and experimental laboratory activities. Henceforth, the researcher recommended that learners in areas across and outside information technology courses and curriculum may protrude distinctive scaffolding strategies as they manifest. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The worldwide demand for software developers are increasing, however, students are facing problems to learn programming at universities. To make things worse, the failure and dropout rates are high, especially in introductory computer programming courses. To address this type of problem, new strategies have been proposed to engage students in programming courses. One strategy is to use game elements to learn programming. Game elements are important for the success or failure of an educational serious game. In the same way, the students' learning process may benefit from proper use of game elements. In this work, we aim to identify and evaluate which game elements contribute to the students' learning in programming education. We performed 19 user studies to investigate the impact on learning of game elements present in two serious games for learning programming. The study was carried out with students from introductory periods of the undergraduate program in Information Systems. Our results identify some game elements that have positive effect on learning programming. The students' feedback also indicates that game elements help them staying focused, engaged and that games are useful complementary resource for learning process. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In the next decade, China is expectedly becoming the most significant education destination for foreigners. Since information technology is a leading industry in China, its related major computer science would surely attract a considerable number of international students. Therefore, our university and teaching group are going to face this big challenge. Due to the scarcity of teaching resources in ordinary Chinese universities, we have to seek a way to fulfil the vast demand of educating these international students while especially most of them require lecturers provide courses in English. In this paper, we discuss the current problems of international education in China and whether the mixed English teaching can be one possible solution or not. Then we present our teaching reform strategies by showing an example of a module called Mobile Programming with Android. Through applying these strategies, we also list the numerical improvements of students results and skills. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={An attractive learning environment represents one of the key requirements for the students in order to accomplish their educational objectives. Not only the physical location and context influence their capacity to achieve knowledge and to use it creatively, but also the culture in which they learn. Switching from one learning environment to another proves to be a serious challenge for young students like those graduating the high-school and acceding to the university. The two learning environments expose different schedules, requirements, teaching methods, types of interaction (teacher - student and student - student), ways of life (for people who change their social environment), evaluation criteria and consequences of not passing the examinations. Furthermore, within the framework of an undergraduate environment, teaching and learning disciplines like “Computer Programming” or “Introduction to Operating Systems” become even more challenging due to the significant differences in prior knowledge achieved by the students. In order to overcome this issue, teaching strategies should consider active and differentiated learning, otherwise student’s motivation could decrease and, as a result, their personal and professional skills might not be developed to their full potential. This paper outlines some particular aspects involved in teaching first year students from the Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science - UPB, Systems Engineering section. In addition, the study tries to identify whether there exist strong and objective indicators (besides the direct feedback from the students and the intuition of the tenured professors) for supporting differentiated learning. To establish this, we continue and develop a previous study based on Data Mining analysis performed over various data related to “Computer Programming” course. This time, we investigate if students’ results are somehow correlated by extending the Data Warehouse with information regarding the “Introduction to Operating Systems” course. As suggested above, the students’ target group is the same, the courses are taught in the same semester and they belong to the same field, so we try to identify if previous background is of some importance and how does it affect current and future learning behaviour of the students.

abstract={Learning programming requires various skills and knowledge that novice programmers are expected to obtain in a limited time frame during introductory programming courses. Students are often introduced to programming for the first time at the university and overwhelmed with different programming languages and paradigms. Teachers are changing strategies and educational researchers are analyzing the data to suggest different paths. However, long-term studies in learning and teaching programming are not that common. In this research we present the analysis of using specially designed open source framework for teaching object-oriented programming during five years. © 2019 TEMPUS Publications.},

abstract={Research has shown that educational games are effective in motivating students to learn. To contribute to ongoing research in the area of educational games, we developed and evaluated a peer-quizzing game called “Tower of Questions” which supports collaborative learning through asking and answering questions. The game uses the mechanics and dynamics found in tower defense games, a sub-genre of strategy games usually played in a massive online gathering. Our game is played in a class by students who use pseudonyms. Players can create virtual towers by asking questions, and other students conquer the towers by answering the questions. Students receive points for asking and answering questions in the game. To evaluate the effect of the game on student engagement and learning, we recruited 37 first-year university students in an introductory programming class who played the game regularly during the entire term, asking questions related to topics they learned in their course. The results of the analysis of the students’ activities indicate a strong correlation between the number of towers created and towers conquered, i.e. that students who actively posted questions also actively answered the questions of others. Students familiar with tower defense games engaged more in attacking other students’ towers (answering questions) than in creating new towers (asking questions). The post-survey data collected from the students shows that 82.14% of them found the game useful as a learning tool. © The Authors, 2019. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Computing Education has become a widely popular research field at top universities with much attention aimed at improving and expanding K-12 computer science education. Though numerous efforts are being made by institutions, industries, and the community, many challenges still prevent widespread K-12 CS education. Our research aims to alleviate these challenges with a new adaptive learning system to teach introductory programming in a unique and interesting way. Adaptive learning strategies normally adapt based on a student's previous knowledge, pace, or learning style. Our research takes a new approach to adapt the content, practice problems, and examples based on a student's interests. Interest-based learning has been shown to improve intrinsic motivation, leading to better learning and achievements. This paper outlines how SAIL - a System for Adaptive Interest-based Learning - could impact introductory CS education and alleviate many of its challenges. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In the field of education, disabled people inclusion gains special importance for any country when intending to attain actual social integration. Universities must take on the social responsibility for embracing disabled students and creating strategies that facilitate their educational process and favour the completion of their professional studies in order to attain truly individual autonomy. Even though university education is increasingly taking actions to guarantee equal opportunities as regards contents acquisition (ensuring attendance, participation, and success for all students), most degree programs of Information Systems Engineering do not include teaching strategies for visually impaired students. In this context, this work presents a collaborative work experience that was carried out in the Regional Faculty of Universidad Tecnológica Nacional in the province of Santa Fe, Argentina. This experience included taking active steps to provide a process for teaching programming contents that is appropriate for a visually impaired student starting the Information Systems Engineering Degree Program. More specifically, teaching strategies are presented in detail along with the tools that were developed in the programming area of Algoritmos y Estructuras de Datos course so as to adjust the available tools and material to that particular student's needs. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Didactic and pedagogical tools must evolve to face the new challenges that currently arise in this society of technology and knowledge. Among the new strategies are those that allow motivating students, making them able to perform activities in an entertaining way, feeling pleasure in doing them. for this reason, academic sphere must take concepts of games that inherently have the characteristic of catching their users. This doesn't entails implementing serious games in the subjects but on the contrary requires adding attractive to daily tasks. It is there where gamification, that is, adding playful elements to non-ludic activities, takes on a leading role. This work presents a gamified web platform for the practice of programming exercises, accessible from the web, where students gets an immediate feedback of their activities, also allowing to guide them in the resolution of exercises. This platform is offered to students as an optional tool, being gamification a strong incentive for its use. In this article incorporated elements of gamification and results obtained when implementing and using the tool are detailed, by means of statistics of use and opinions of the students obtained by surveys. These results show the wide participation and acceptance of the proposal. © 2018 Red Universitaria de Campus Virtuales.},

abstract={Along with the imperatives of Chinese education strategy and the practical requirements of our university (Beijing Institute of Technology, BIT)'s Double-First Class development blueprint, the cultivation of innovative talents becomes even more important. Since more than a decade of professional accumulation and talent training, school of computer science & technology has explored and gradually practiced an Integration Cultivation Mechanism for Innovative Talents in CS Discipline, namely ICM4IT. This paper introduces ICM4IT from the five aspects in details. That is, idea (Outcomes-Based Education, OBE), mechanism (Bachelor-Master- PhD penetration cultivation), mode (Multi-layer/mode/platform internationalization), practice (MOOC/SPOC-based online & offline teaching), support (research & education coordination). Education data shows that ICM4IT in CS-discipline at BIT has achieved remarkable achievements. CS ranking enters A-Class according to results of Discipline Evaluation in National Colleges and Universities announced on Dec 28, 2017. Furthermore, authors also share the experiences of above five parts during the implementation processes, as well as their thinking of solving emerging issues under the New Engineering Discipline. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={For more effective teaching and learning in undergraduate engineering education, there is a strong need for faculty professional development to instruction from instructor-centered, information-transmission teaching by lecture to more student-centered, conceptual-change learning by active learning through student engagement. The National Science Foundation IUSE (Improving Undergraduate STEM Education) program has funded a large-scale faculty development program at a large southwestern university called Just-in-Time-Teaching with Two Way Formative Feedback for Multiple Disciplinary (JTFD) Programs. The project scales to seven engineering disciplines with 84 faculty using a train-the-trainer model to engage faculty in year-long apprenticeships with a semester of eight biweekly workshops followed by a semester of six biweekly mentor-supported classroom innovation implementation. Prior project research has shown that evidence-based practices such as student engagement, contextualization of content, and two-way formative feedback can improve student attitudes, achievement and persistence. Research also shows that changing faculty teaching beliefs toward evidence-based strategies and practices can be difficult, but the transition can be eased when disciplinary communities of practice support faculty while they are changing their beliefs and practices. The personal interactions that occur within and between the disciplinary communities of practice are being characterized in JTFD with social network analysis (SNA) and will be correlated to shifts, across time, in the beliefs and practice of the faculty toward student-centered instruction. Prior project SNA research has shown faculty who are socially better connected to one another also teach with more student-centered classroom practices, as found from classroom observations. This was assessed by a tool called Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP) which has 25 items related to evidence based practice and is used by trained observers to assess classroom practice. Faculty beliefs and classroom practice are being assessed in JTFD with surveys, open ended questions and classroom observations. Faculty motivation is being assessed with a new survey using expectancy-value theory. The impact of faculty changes in classroom practice results have been collected during the spring 2016 term from four pairs of disciplinary leader trainers who completed the eight workshops. One result showed that the effect of the eight workshops on faculty's student-centered classroom practice, as measured by RTOP, was an improvement between 34% and 65%. Another result showed that, for two faculty, compared to the same class for a prior semester, significant gains in the student grade ratio (the ratio of A's plus B's to C's plus D's plus E's plus W's). Thus, the cohort of eight faculty trained during the Spring 2016 semester shifted their practice significantly from teacher-centered instruction to student-centered learning as shown by the classroom observation RTOP results. Because of the limited number of participants other measures of change in faculty beliefs and motivation were positive, but did not show statistical significance. Future cohorts with larger numbers of participants can reveal correlations between faculty beliefs, motivation and classroom practice. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.},

funding_text 1={Research has shown that instruction through student engagement is more effective than traditional knowledge transmission through lecture1,2. Today, however, most instructors teach as they were taught, by information transmission through lecture. As such, the challenge then becomes how to promote a shift in instruction from faculty-centered teaching to student-centered learning. In order to facilitate such a shift, creating materials for adaptation to student engagement teaching is not sufficient because there needs to be a shift in faculty beliefs about instruction. This shift needs to help move instructors from viewing themselves as disseminators of knowledge and concepts to facilitators who help students learn the desired knowledge and concepts through student engagement. As such, a means to promote this shift has been the creation of a faculty development program. Such a program has been funded by the National Science Foundation IUSE (Improving Undergraduate STEM Education) program for large-scale faculty development program at a large southwestern university called Just-in-Time-Teaching with Two Way Formative Feedback for Multiple Disciplinary (JTFD) Programs. The project scales a previous, smaller single disciplinary development program, Just-in-Time Teaching with Frequent Formative Feedback (JTF)3, to seven engineering disciplines with 84 faculty. The seven disciplines include aerospace (AE), biomedical (BME), chemical (CHE), civil, (CEE) materials (MSE), and mechanical engineering (ME), as well as construction (CON).

abstract={The graduation rate in engineering can be correlated to several factors, including race and gender. Nationally, the populations with the highest engineering graduation rates are majority males, with Asian males at 66.5% and Caucasian males at 59.7%. The goal of diversity and inclusion program practitioners is to establish parity in graduation rates for all populations. There are several interventions that are proven to increase the retention and graduation of underrepresented students in engineering. Some of these include math intensive summer bridging, tutoring, cohort building where students establish a learning community. Singly these are somewhat effective, but when multiple interventions are applied over multiple years, the effect is additive and there is a significant increase in the likelihood of graduation. Outside of traditional applications, there other interventions that are shown to be effective on student retention, but they are not typically applied to underrepresented students. One of these is international scholarship, or study abroad experiences. The research question addressed by this project is the following: While long term applications of traditional retention programming for underrepresented students yield graduation rates at parity or exceeding that of majority males, could the graduation rate be even higher with the addition of a scholarly international experience, an intervention not typically applied to underrepresented populations? In this study, traditional interventions were applied to 10 students at Pennsylvania State University (all underrepresented in engineering by race or gender) over a four year period. In addition, an international or study abroad experience was added. Interventions were applied addressing four known variables that increase retention: financial support, math and academic preparation, the learning community/cohort building, and international education. Three objectives or expected outcomes of this project were: 1. Increased retention and graduation rates of participating students in STEM fields. 2. Improved programs and strategies for sustaining diversity in STEM fields. 3. Improved access to engineering educational opportunities. The quantitative measure of success for the NSF Pathways project is determined by the retention and graduation rate of the students in STEM fields at the end of five years. The current four-year retention rate for these students in 2017 was at 100%. The graduation rate of these ten students who completed all interventions is also expected to be at 100% in a STEM field, with 90% in engineering. Qualitative data through focus groups and essays indicated the importance of building a strong learning community, and the added impact of international scholarly collaboration. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.},

abstract={Learning to program has been classified as problematic learning with high drop-out rates and low motivation at university level. Like the learning of a natural language the learning of syntax and basic techniques in a programming language is easier and more natural if started at a younger age. This study is based on an evaluation of a pilot project for students in a Primary school where computational thinking and programming concepts have been introduced as play-based learning. Students have learnt concepts such as 'Bubble sort' by playing the algorithm without any computer. Later the learnt concepts and algorithms have been implemented with Scratch and the Python programming language as main tools. The aim of the study is to describe and discuss a model for implementing computational thinking and programming for fifth grade students by play-based learning. As the overall research strategy the case study approach was used to evaluate this pilot project. Data has been collected in a combination of observations, interviews and group discussions during a 15 session pilot course and three workshops on teacher training. Findings have been analysed thematically and presented using the SWOT framework to identify and discuss strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats in the östersund model. Learning outcomes of the pilot were promising but with individual variations in the student group. The idea of introducing programming and computational thinking as early as in primary school seems like a good idea, but the recommendation is to keep sessions play-based and with enjoyment as the key feature to engage primary school students. Conducted sessions in the pilot are worth replicating and so are the teacher training workshops. However, the challenge that remains is to create a sustainable and scalable implementation of the described model including primary school teachers' professional development. © The Authors, 2017.},

abstract={Control engineering is a cornerstone of most undergraduate engineering programs in colleges and universities around the world. The analysis and synthesis of automatic controllers, in particular, the PID controller, is a central focus of these courses and modules. However, due to its highly abstract nature, students usually find the content challenging and difficult to comprehend. This is aggravated by the employment of traditional lecture/recitation deductive teaching formats as means of delivery of the content. Here, an inductive-based week long design activity strategically held in the middle of the semester was conceived to introduce and motivate the notion of feedback control. During the course of the week, students in teams design, analyze and synthesize automatic controllers to enable a standardized differential wheeled robotic platform to traverse a line circuit autonomously. The strategy to achieve this capability is intentionally left to be open-ended, and students have the design freedom to select and position sensors needed to sense the track, as well as implement and troubleshoot the programming required to enable autonomous control. The activity culminates with a pulsating head-To-head single elimination tournament to decide the overall champion. Copyright © 2017 ASME.},

abstract={This paper describes an introductory engineering course utilizing active learning strategies and standards-based grading. This first-year course for engineering and technology students at a community college emphasizes working in teams to complete hands-on activities using EXCEL and structured programming with MATLAB. Initial assignments involve using EXCEL to display and analyze data from Ohm's Law and the speed of sound in air. The next assignment requires distance measuring with ultrasound and designing an ultrasonic range-finder. In the remainder of the assignments over the final three-quarters of the semester, MATLAB is used as a structured programming language to first control the movement of a stepper-motor rotor and then to identify different translucent materials from their visible light spectra as measured by a spectrometer. A final project combines the steppermotor rotor with spectroscopy to automatically identify different oils by their spectra produced with a tungsten lamp. Oral communication expertise is a very empowering skill-set to possess and being able to work well in a group and to deliver a presentation are highly prized job skills. To further reinforce the learned concepts and to incorporate another valuable skill-set, students are required to deliver over the course of the semester three presentations of their projects. Standards-based evaluation is used to assess each student's submissions. Standards for each week's submissions are published at the beginning of the semester and reemphasized as needed. As the course has a goal of facilitating learning, and encouraging the mastery of new skills rather than penalizing mistakes, resubmission of assignments that have not reached the required standard is allowed and encouraged. During the first four years of this course, Supplementary Instruction (SI) with SI Leaders was gradually introduced and is now incorporated into all sections of the course including adjunct instructor offerings. To document student success, data on student achievement in the course has been collected for twenty-two sections of the course over a span of four and one-half years. Data on course completion rates for this course will be presented and compared to course completion rates for other engineering courses at the community college which do not have SI and to the course completion rates for all courses at the community college. Longitudinal data on student persistence in engineering at the community college and on engineering students transferring to the university will also be presented. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.},

abstract={Leaning on the derived results conducted by Central Mindanao University Phil-LiDAR 2.B.11 Image Processing Component, the paper attempts to provides the application of the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) derived products in arriving quality Landcover classification considering the theoretical approach of data analysis principles to minimize the common problems in image classification. These are misclassification of objects and the non-distinguishable interpretation of pixelated features that results to confusion of class objects due to their closely-related spectral resemblance, unbalance saturation of RGB information is a challenged at the same time. Only low density LiDAR point cloud data is exploited in the research denotes as 2 pts/m2 of accuracy which bring forth essential derived information such as textures and matrices (number of returns, intensity textures, nDSM, etc.) in the intention of pursuing the conditions for selection characteristic. A novel approach that takes gain of the idea of object-based image analysis and the principle of allometric relation of two or more observables which are aggregated for each acquisition of datasets for establishing a proportionality function for data-partioning. In separating two or more data sets in distinct regions in a feature space of distributions, non-trivial computations for fitting distribution were employed to formulate the ideal hyperplane. Achieving the distribution computations, allometric relations were evaluated and match with the necessary rotation, scaling and transformation techniques to find applicable border conditions. Thus, a customized hybrid feature was developed and embedded in every object class feature to be used as classifier with employed hierarchical clustering strategy for cross-examining and filtering features. This features are boost using machine learning algorithms as trainable sets of information for a more competent feature detection. The product classification in this investigation was compared to a classification based on conventional object-oriented approach promoting straight-forward functionalities of the software eCognition. A compelling rise of efficiency in the overall accuracy (74.4% to 93.4%) and kappa index of agreement (70.5% to 91.7%) is noticeable based on the initial process. Nevertheless, having low-dense LiDAR dataset could be enough in generating exponential increase of performance in accuracy.},

abstract={This paper shows the assessment of teaching strategies used to develop linguistic competence in seven preschool classrooms following the methodology of Project Approach (PA). The experience involves 172 persons who belong to the childhood network RIECU (School-Centre for Teachers-University Network). The study was based on a qualitative approach and is carried out through a multiple case study. Various instruments are used to gather information: document analysis from the center and classroom programming, students' productions and activities, and group interview with teachers. The most relevant findings relate to: (1) teaching strategies that promote the development of linguistic competence are used, enhancing the students' communicative and active approach; (2) the methodology of Project Approach promotes a climate of dialogue and interaction in the classroom, an approach to global learning and research that facilitates the development of linguistic competence; (3) difficulties are appreciated by the teachers to make a personal and systematic evaluation of communicative competence in the classroom. The teachers expressed some difficulties when defining evaluation criteria and indicators in accordance with the methodology of Project Approach.},

abstract={The SUCCEEd program at California State University-Los Angles (Cal State LA) was designed within an integrated curriculum context to overcome the low success rate with respect to graduation and professional licensing, a common problem in engineering programs at minority serving institutions. The curriculum design has been driven by outcomes established to help Engineering majors acquire a strong foundation in core competencies; i.e., in: (1) analysis, (2) applications, (3) design and modeling, (4) communication, and (5) professionalism. The curriculum has also been designed to provide cohesiveness between the different courses in a given term so that students can focus on common topics from the perspective of each of the five competency-areas and see the interconnectedness of the material they are learning in all five classes. Although, the integrated curriculum approach was developed in the late-80s, it has not been widely adopted due to various obstacles at the individual, departmental, and institutional levels. Many of these obstacles are common to strategies that require major transformation in an engineering program. The manuscript reports on the programmatic and administrative challenges encountered at Cal State LA, and the strategies used to overcome them during the implementation of the integrated curriculum pilot program. The pilot study focused on integrating/contextualizing nine quarter units of lower division engineering courses (i.e.: statics, programming, matrix algebra, and computer-aided design). The paper concludes by reporting on preliminary assessment data. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2015.},

abstract={Programming is one of the courses offered in computer education in the Universities and Colleges of Education in Nigeria. Various studies carried out show that students perform poorly in programming courses. Based on this fact, the researcher investigated the attitudes of computer education students towards programming courses. The study also explored effective ways of improving the teaching and learning of programming courses in computer education. The population for the study was comprised of 532 computer education students and 67 lecturers/instructors in both Colleges of Education and Universities in Enugu State, Nigeria. A sample size of 367 was used for the study, using a simple random sampling technique to select 300 computer education students, while the entire 67 lecturers/instructors were studied. The study used three research instruments for data collection. The first instrument was the Programming Attitudes Questionnaire (PAQ) designed to analyze students' attitudes toward programming courses. The second instrument was the Perceived Level of Difficulty of Programming Languages Questionnaire (PLDPLQ) designed to evaluate the students' perceived level of difficulty of programming languages taught in Nigerian higher institutions. The reliability of the instruments was determined using the Cronbach alpha formula to test for the internal consistency of the items, and reliability coefficients of 0.91 and 0.87 were obtained respectively for PAQ and PLDPLQ. The data collected were analyzed using mean scores and t-test statistics. The third instrument, structured interview, was used to identify the factors responsible for poor performance of students in programming courses as well as the strategies for enhancing the teaching and learning of programming courses in Nigerian higher institutions. The findings of the study revealed that students' attitudes toward programming as a course in Nigerian higher education was found to be positive. However, factors such as lack of practical during programming classes, the use of traditional teaching methods, insufficient instructional materials are among other barriers responsible for poor performance of students in programming courses. It was recommended that computer education programmes should be well-funded by the government; programming lecturers should emphasize more on hands-on activities during programming classes; competent/qualified lecturers should be employed, trained and retrained on new trends in computer programming, among others. © Common Ground, Emmanuel ChukwunweikeNwangwu.},

abstract={In the search of teaching strategies more consistent with the current needs of the industry and with the new university pedagogical model, an action research project was carried in the programming courses of the study program of Systems Engineering at the Universidad Nacional of Costa Rica (UNA). The project gradually introduced the principles of autonomy, collaborative learning and shared assessment. This paper reports the experience gained during the three years of the project in terms of a specific proposal for implementing the three principles in the area of programming. Aspects to be considered for an initiative of this kind to be successful are also presented. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The education and development of maritime leaders is integral to the mission of all maritime universities. With the increasing complexity of ship systems and the modern maritime environment, it is vital that maritime professionals be educated to the highest standards of teamwork and leadership, rather than focusing exclusively on their training as entry-level mates, engineers and shoreside professionals. While all maritime universities have elements of leadership in their student development, few have fully developed leadership programs within their academic coursework. This paper proposes a set of leadership approaches and techniques that can be employed in the classroom environment and argues that many leadership techniques and strategies can easily be embedded in existing major-specific coursework, and not just courses specifically dedicated to leadership. The techniques and approaches addressed were developed in two courses in the Global Studies and Maritime Affairs major. The key unit of analysis was student project teams, specifically, "leaderless" teams. While the expected salutary effects of the techniques and approaches used were not initially realized, they did demonstrate significant remedial benefits. The findings suggest that adequate development of the leadership capacities and skills discussed cannot be achieved in a single course. A multi-stage arc of leadership development, spanning curricular and co-curricular programming is indicated. © 2014 Australian Maritime College, an institute of the University of Tasmania.},

abstract={A course well experienced will leave students with good programming habits, the ability to learn on their own, and a favorable impression of programming. At present, many institutions, even economic and management universities, have set up Java programming language as a compulsory course aiming to improve programming capacity and enhance their logical thinking skills. However, there are many differences in Java program language teaching methods and contents between economics and management (EM) major’s students and computer science and information major’s students for the sake of their knowledge background. This paper discusses some of the peculiarities of the Java programming language that make it difficult to learn and some suggestions to overcome them for EM students. Aiming to problems such as not clearly teaching objects, too professional teaching contents, focusing on theory but ignoring practice, and too single form of assessment, we proposed such strategies: understanding the importance of curriculum; arranging content reasonably; adding case teaching and improving the teaching experiments, in order to enhance the quality of teaching effect in Shandong University of Financial and Economics (SDUFE) based on many years of teaching experience. Specifically, as well as some of the teaching paradigms and programming tools we have employed. From the student’s feedbacks and scores in the end of seminar, we know the effectiveness and validity of teaching reforms. In addition, learning interest and high score rate have greatly improved in the past five years. © 2014 WIT Press.},

abstract={Distance Education is a kind of teaching in which a variety of teaching activities and the communication between students are achieved through peculiarly prepared contents and environments at a certain station in the cases when there is no possibility to conduct in-class activities. One of the most significant constraints of distance education conducted by several universities is the lack of qualified content and the limitations in the presentation of the content. Herein there is a need for reference models that will show how to make material design, constitute an efficient theoretical base for presentation of the course content. Therefore, in this study for material design in Distance Education, Elaboration Theory was employed, and a sample course design was accomplished. With its seven basic components (an Elaborative Sequence, Learning Prerequisite Sequences, Summarizers, Synthesizers, Analogies, Cognitive Strategy Activators, Learner Control) Elaboration Theory guides the teaching designers about how the teaching content and its presentations should be. In this study, a material design including four subjects was conducted for an introductory programming course in the scope of guiding principles of ET, and at every stage of this design, four experts' views were received in order to ensure its validity. The suggested style of material design is hoped to eliminate at a visible level the insufficiencies in favor of synchronous distance learning practices.},

abstract={Purpose: Implementing process management methodology through Lean Management and Design Thinking provides a new way to manage surgical blocks, maximize efficiency and adapt to the high variability of demand. This article presents our experience of implementing a set of improvement actions within the surgical process in the context of Lean Healthcare Processes. The project involved a total of 900 healthcare professionals over a 3-year period (2017-2019) and has impacted over 38,000 surgical patients each year at the Vall d’Hebron University Hospital in Barcelona, Spain. The purpose of this article is to present a set of improvement projects within the surgical process and show the indicators that monitor its evolution. These projects have been implemented successfully in a hospital with high surgical complexity and indicate how health care professionals and process engineers can work together as a team to improve healthcare resources. Design/methodology/approach: To evaluate the effectiveness of the actions presented, we propose a series of standardized indicators showing how our findings increase the efficiency of the surgical process. We also indicate Lean projects that can reduce patient waiting times and increase capacity. Below is a management model for the surgical process that considers industrial production criteria such as resource planning, optimizing the use of operating rooms and professionals’ time and generating the best surgery combinations. Findings: Projects that have increased efficiency in the surgical block the most have been standardized and converted into a model of action. This is designed to adapt to any level of complexity within the hospital process. The set of improvement projects has been divided into 6 stages: Programming, Material logistics process, pre-surgical stage, intra-surgical stage, post-surgical stage and transversal projects; each affecting a different area of the general hospital (not only the surgical unit). Furthermore, a visual flow chart was designed using the results of the project. Findings from the study have led to a 15% increase in surgical capacity without the need for new resources. The average hospital stay also dropped from 7.2 days to 4.1 days. The flow vision in the care process improves the experience of both patients and health care professionals, who see their participation as part of the whole health care process. Research limitations/implications: the projects were mainly developed at the Vall d’Hebron University Hospital. Although several of these projects have been carried out in other hospitals in Spain by the same team of process engineers, results may be biased when the team provides support within its own process department, compared to when it supports the local team in another hospital temporarily. Another important limitation is that it takes several months to implement and consolidate the improvement projects and demonstrate improved indicators in a sustainable way over time. This matrix of projects is more than a specific action, a cultural change with the entire surgical department. Originality/value: This study sets out a proposed practical example of applying surgery management tools in the surgical process. Our proposal can offer hospital managers and surgical coordinators an orderly, streamlined project guide for overall surgical performance indicators. The main results from developing the model include the degree of satisfaction shown by healthcare professionals and the determined commitment from the center’s management team to promote process management using Lean methodology. This commitment continued despite the challenges of shifting the organizational structure towards process management, which is a complex task requiring a period of adaptation and learning. Healthcare management has always prioritized increasing surgical patient safety and satisfaction. Patient flows are increased and resources used more efficiency by shifting the focus to the patient and the processes gone through during their hospital stay. This improvement project provides us with the best example of Lean methodology implementation if reinvested in bettering healthcare. This in turn increases the value perceived by patients, which is the ultimate purpose of the process. © 2023, OmniaScience. All rights reserved.},

The educational proposal presented in this research made use of the flipped classroom methodology and the Discord platform as an agile means of communication. The results are very encouraging because it allowed students to participate in their own learning in an active and self-directed way so that they self-regulate their own learning path individually and in groups; based on flipped classroom and successfully deployed on the Discord platform. © 2023 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: The present study analyses the design of programming literacy in the sixth grade of Primary Education, starting from the use of simple activities with visual block-based programming, through Scratch, and progressively linking difficulty to the use of the Unity engine, and the C# language, with simple activities identical to those created in Scratch. Objectives: This research aims to evaluate future teachers' abilities and attitudes regarding programming and its educational possibilities. We intend to evaluate the viability of a teaching proposal that combines a visual block-based programming environment and a more advanced one, based on C#. Method: In the settings of two public Spanish universities, we analyse the possibilities in the training of future teachers who are studying for a degree in Primary Education Teaching and a degree in Pedagogy. Based on a test and three scales, descriptive data and statistical inference are detailed through a quasi-experimental design with a Student's t-test in the first dimension, and a Wilcoxon test in the second dimension. Results: The participants improved their performance and attitudes towards programming with the intervention of the study in the use of coding. Conclusions: It can be concluded that coding is essential in teacher training, and that a greater presence of programming training in higher education is essential. The benefits are visible in the pedagogical approach of coding related to creativity, innovation, motivation, an active approach and interest, highlighting the fact that the implementation of visual block-based programming by blocks and engines is feasible in Elementary Education. The training proposal—provided by appropriate progression, selection, and sequencing of content—fosters basic and practical teacher training, and this can be defined as an apt training solution. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Featured Application: The artifact developed in this article is applicable to AGV and production planning optimization problems that align with the principles of the job-shop scheduling problem (JSSP) and the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSSP). Artificial intelligence is considered to be a significant technology for driving the future evolution of smart manufacturing environments. At the same time, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) play an essential role in manufacturing systems due to their potential to improve internal logistics by increasing production flexibility. Thereby, the productivity of the entire system relies on the quality of the schedule, which can achieve production cost savings by minimizing delays and the total makespan. However, traditional scheduling algorithms often have difficulties in adapting to changing environment conditions, and the performance of a selected algorithm depends on the individual scheduling problem. Therefore, this paper aimed to analyze the scheduling problem classes of AGVs by applying design science research to develop an algorithm selection approach. The designed artifact addressed a catalogue of characteristics that used several machine learning algorithms to find the optimal solution strategy for the intended scheduling problem. The contribution of this paper is the creation of an algorithm selection method that automatically selects a scheduling algorithm, depending on the problem class and the algorithm space. In this way, production efficiency can be increased by dynamically adapting the AGV schedules. A computational study with benchmark literature instances unveiled the successful implementation of constraint programming solvers for solving JSSP and FJSSP scheduling problems and machine learning algorithms for predicting the most promising solver. The performance of the solvers strongly depended on the given problem class and the problem instance. Consequently, the overall production performance increased by selecting the algorithms per instance. A field experiment in the learning factory at Reutlingen University enabled the validation of the approach within a running production scenario. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={Based on a current Research to Practice Partnership (RPP) between a southeastern public university and a state virtual public school in the United States, ten high school teachers from a virtual school who teach Computer Science (CS) online participated in a summer workshop to collaborate through a participatory action research project regarding design, facilitation, and evaluation strategies to be included in effective professional development. The questions were posed through an online collaborative Jamboard during the summer workshop. The teacher posts were qualitatively analyzed to identify common themes. Recommendations for professional development on design included CS content, how to teach CS, and CS tools and activities. For facilitation, they recommended resources for supplemental instruction and feedback tools for providing feedback in various modalities and a tool repository. For assessment, they recommended content knowledge assessments, including lab assignments, single and pair programming, and coding assessments. Overall recommendations for a professional development course to teach CS online were also offered. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Nowadays, when the changes that appear in programming paradigms and in software process development methodologies are extremely frequent, teaching Computer Science throughout all levels of study has become a demanding task. To all these are added changes caused by the dynamics of the society and the traits of the current learners and how they learn. A new era of education has just begun. To cope with the challenges mentioned above, teachers from three levels of study had been invited to share their experience in teaching sorting algorithms, through questionnaires, in order to achieve learning efficiency for students. Thus, the paper proposes a framework for a unitary approach of teaching sorting algorithms. Its contribution is twofold: firstly, it frames a pedagogical approach defined as a conceptual framework in teaching sorting algorithms by mining and investigating contents and aspects taught at three curriculum levels, following the Revised Bloom's Taxonomy. Secondly, a software tool is proposed - AlSort - based on gamification and storytelling as a learning strategy of sorting algorithms. The tool is implemented for the gymnasium and high school level and it is under development for the university. It covers the first three levels from Bloom's Taxonomy. © 2022 ACM.},

abstract={This Work in Progress Paper presents techniques adapted to teach first-year engineering courses post-pandemic. Challenges faced by students and faculty will also be presented in this paper along with some guidance and best practices. In March 2020, COVID-19 was announced as a pandemic that began impacting higher education during the Spring semester. Many land-grant universities were not fully equipped with the tools to offer the best learning experience to students due to lock-down and the inability to access the laboratories and teaching equipment. This global pandemic had caused the universities to change their operations and impelled instructors to switch to online instruction halfway into the semester. Many universities began exploring options and investing their resources to devise teaching pedagogies that best fit the needs of their students. Although universities had been utilizing some learning management systems such as Blackboard, D2L, Canvas, etc., an unanticipated need for online instruction impelled a mandated use of these learning management systems for full content delivery. Although engineering courses could easily be revamped to distance learning platforms, there were some challenges due to the nature of the coursework and assessment of outcomes. Adhering to the social distancing guidelines and university mask mandates along with the availability of vaccination have made it possible to return to in-person teaching and learning. The purpose of this paper is to: a) present some of the challenges faced by the first-year engineering students during the transition to and from distance learning approaches, b) share some of the results from the assessment of student attitudes during this transition, and c) share some of the best practices adopted by the instructors during these uncertain times. The first-year engineering curriculum usually involves fundamental concepts and provides an opportunity for students to explore several engineering disciplines. In a normal learning environment, engineering courses tend to be challenging due to higher expectations for problem-solving, mathematics, and scientific concepts, and adding external factors such as the pandemic adds more complications. Since the pandemic began in early 2020, students and instructors have been under constant pressure to satisfy the basic requirements of attaining student learning objectives. In this process of attaining the objectives, several challenges had been encountered and overcome in different ways. The focus of this research work is to study the first-year engineering course and present the challenges associated with the delivery of the course content, teaching engineering concepts and applications in a remote setting, and communication between instructors and students during the lock-down period. This paper also presents some of the teaching strategies that have been investigated by the instructors to assist students during difficult times while balancing student expectations. This work in progress study was initiated in Spring 2020 at a small regional campus of The Ohio State University. Challenges arising due to the transition to and from distance learning modalities were observed in the first-year engineering courses, Fundamentals of Engineering I and Fundamentals of Engineering II. These courses are two-credit hours each and introduce engineering problem-solving, data analysis, project-based learning, computer programming, 3-D Modeling and simulation, project management, and teamwork. Teaching strategies adopted by the instructors including restructuring the course, revisioning the assessment of course goals, and utilizing alternative approaches to assess student performance will be discussed in this paper. The findings of this paper will provide an opportunity for educators to learn from the unique experience and develop strategies to address the continuously changing teaching and learning environments that have evolved as a result of the pandemic. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.},

abstract={A first-year experience is critical for the long-term academic growth of a student. The literature is full of works that argue how important is the first-year experience. At Whitacre College of Engineering (WCE), we adopted the importance of having excellent and skilled-based experience in engineering students' first year. This paper provides a review of an engineering education practice, including teaching approaches and institutional strategies to support student success during their first college year. Undergraduate students in Whitacre College of Engineering (WCE) at Texas Tech University follow a common core curriculum in their first and second semesters of study. The First common First Year (FCY) curriculum was implemented in Fall2020 and formed to introduce certain basic skills to engineering students; and acquaint students with the interaction of skills, techniques, logic, and creativity in engineering problem formulation and solving. The FCY curriculum includes classical foundational studies in calculus, chemistry, physics, English, and new studies in computational thinking (programming/data science), Bioinspired engineering design class, and Ethics/humanities science. Since the first-year experience is critical in the long-term academic growth of a student, a plan was designed to integrate and advance what students are learning from the first common year to their sophomore, junior, and senior year with more emphasis, given to programming/data science, Bio-inspired engineering design class, and ethics & humanities. To effectively integrate these courses into the upper-level courses, a group of faculty members from different engineering departments, called disciples, were designated. The main duties of these disciples are: 1. providing relevant examples from each engineering major related to computational thinking, bio-inspired design, ethics, and humanities to the faculty members teaching the common first year (FCY). 2. monitoring the advancement and integration of First common year (FCY) newly added courses through sophomore (second year), junior (third year), and senior years (fourth year). 3. Evaluating the impact of the newly added courses on the attainment of ABET student outcomes 1-7. An example of how the FYC content is carried out and integrated into the petroleum engineering curriculum is presented in this paper. Furthermore, the paper shows how ABET student outcomes were mapped to these courses. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022},

abstract={Creating effective professional development is critical to support high school teachers who teach computer science (CS) online. The context of this study is based on a current Research to Practice Partnership (RPP) between the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in the United States and North Carolina Virtual Public School (NCVPS). Ten high school teachers from the NCVPS who teach CS online participated in a summer workshop and recommended design, facilitation, and evaluation strategies to be included in effective professional development (PD). The summer workshop was conducted synchronously via Zoom. It provided the opportunity to discuss teacher perceptions related to the research questions "What design, facilitation, and assessment strategies are helpful to include in an AP Computer Science Advanced course?"and "What recommendations do you have for designing an online professional development course for high school teachers to teach computer science online?"The questions were posed through an online collaborative Jamboard, and the affinity diagram method was used for data collection and document analysis was conducted. The teacher posts were qualitatively analyzed to identify common themes. Findings for professional development on content design included CS content, how to teach CS, and CS tools and activities. For assessment, they recommended content knowledge assessments, including lab assignments, single and pair programming, and coding assessments. They recommended tools for supplemental instruction, integration of discussion boards for interaction, and tools and strategies to provide feedback for professional development. © 2022 Owner/Author.},

funding_text 1={There is a need for more research to examine online teacher professional development specific to teaching computer science online. The research team recruited ten online computer science teachers from NCVPS to participate in the summer workshop in which they individually posted their responses on the Jamboards which are digital interactive whiteboards. As part of the design of the online PD, the lead teachers recommended including content-related resources, especially for teachers who may not have a strong CS background. In addition, they recommended including resources for teaching CS, including examples of how to teach complex CS concepts, and an outline to guide each week. They also recommended including general teaching resources such as tools to assist with learning activities and collaborative tools to share with each other.During the facilitation of the PD, the lead teachers recommended including resources for supplemental instruction and feedback tools. This included tools for providing feedback in various modalities and a tool repository. When asked about assessment strategies for online PD, the lead teachers recommended focusing on content knowledge assessments - including lab assignments, single and pair programming, and coding assessments. They also recommended providing guidance for creating new programming assessments that were not already online, which students can locate, creating formative assessments through the discussion boards, and using 3-2-1 to get feedback on the course. The findings of this study have implications for teachers, administrators, and designers. Teachers who are currently teaching CS courses in an online setting or for those who wish to teach CS online in the future can benefit from the topics in the PD discussed in this study. Through ongoing, high-quality professional development, CS teachers will continue to strengthen their teaching practice and support the various learners within their online class environments. Administrators can benefit from the findings such that they can offer PD for the teachers on these topics if they teach CS online. Designers who design PD, as well as online CS courses, can benefit from the findings and integrate them into the workshops and courses they design. Finally, students benefit if their teachers are able to attend PD aligned to these topics that make them successful.

abstract={Broadening participation in computer science (CS) for primary/elementary students is a growing movement, spurred by computing workforce demands and the need for younger students to develop skills in problem solving and critical/computational thinking. However, offering computer science instruction at this level is directly related to the availability of teachers prepared to teach the subject. Unfortunately, there are relatively few primary/elementary school teachers who have received formal training in computer science, and they often self-report a lack of CS subject matter expertise. Teacher development is a key factor to address these issues, and this paper describes professional development strategies and empirical impacts of a summer institute that included two graduate courses and a series of Saturday workshops during the subsequent academic year. Key elements included teaching a high-level programing language (Python and JavaScript), integrating CS content and pedagogy instruction, and involving both experienced K-12 CS teachers and University faculty as instructors. Empirical results showed that this carefully structured PD that incorporated evidence-based elements of sufficient duration, teacher active learning and collaboration, modeling, practice, and feedback can successfully impact teacher outcomes. Results showed significant gains in teacher CS knowledge (both pedagogy and content), self-efficacy, and perception of CS value. Moderating results - examining possible differential effects depending on teacher gender, years of teaching CS, and geographic locale - showed that the PD was successful with experienced and less experienced teachers, with teachers from both rural and urban locales, and with both males and females. © 2022 ACM.},

abstract={University-level introductory programming courses (e.g., CS1) offer a structured and formal approach for learning programming where instructors design their own curriculum and materials to help students learn difficult concepts. But, there are a myriad of free resources increasingly available online for learning programming that university students can easily access at their fingertips. In this paper, we investigate to what extent students in CS1 make use of resources curated by their instructor vs. online resources that they locate on their own. We conducted surveys and interviews in two consecutive CS1-equivalent classes at a large North-American university and explored how students made selections and assessed the relevance and utility of web-based resources. We observed that students had a strong desire for quick answers and looked for 'exact' matches for their queries in forums rather than consulting videos or other resources that provide higher level explanations more suitable for novices. However, given that these students had a limited vocabulary related to CS1 topics, they struggled in locating the desired information and relied on shallow trial-and-error processes without a clear strategy or self-reflection. Interestingly, despite the lack of perceived success, students still considered their pursuit of online resources as more convenient and less costly than asking for help. Our main contribution is in presenting insights about CS1 students' motivations and behaviours in using web-based resources on their own. We reflect on these findings by drawing upon theories from learning sciences and information sciences. © 2022 ACM.},

abstract={This paper describes the development from scratch of a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control course, which was designed for 5th year Process Engineering master's students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). After taking the course, students are able to program their own nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) in MATLAB, and have gained a good understanding of the most important issues related to the implementation of this type of controller in chemical and biochemical processes. The course follows problem-based learning principles. It is heavily focused on “doing”, where coding assignments are a large part of the course load. The student learning is assessed by an unconventional combination of formative feedback (one-to-one session, where we discuss their assignments and the solution strategies of the students) as well as summative feedback (systematic grading of their assignments and final exam). The student perception of the course, which was assessed by a feedback questionnaire, shows that the course adds value to them by not only helping them write more interesting Master's projects but also by improving their skill set for the job market. © 2022 The Authors.},

abstract={In modern society, digital technology is becoming increasingly important and, at the same time, is experiencing a growing interest in the research landscape. Without digital technology, active participation in professional or private life is no longer imaginable. The European Union also takes this fact into account by establishing digital competence as one of the key competencies for lifelong learning (European Commission 2006, 2018). The development of digital competence and the use of digital technologies in the teaching-learning process also poses major challenges for teacher educators and future teachers, as teachers are expected to contribute to better teaching quality through the use of ICT while serving as role models for the next generations. On the one hand, teachers must have their own digital competence, and on the other hand, they should design lessons in such a way that learners also develop the necessary digital competence. Based on the relevant literature, it can be seen that the concept of digital competence has changed with the development of digital technologies. Ferrari defines digital competence as the set of knowledge, skills, attitudes, abilities, strategies, and values that enable effective, efficient, appropriate, creative, autonomous, flexible, ethical, and reflective action in the context of work, leisure, and learning (2012, 3). According to JISC (2014, o. S.) „ [d]igital competence [...] includes the knowledge and skills required to use information and communication technology and digital media.” Vuorikari (o. D., o. S.) describes „digital competence as an overarching competence (that) also helps us to master other competencies, such as communication, language skills, or basic knowledge in mathematics and science.” At the EU level, two definitions have been put forward by the European Commission. First in 2005 as computer competence and then in 2018 expanded as digital competence. „Digital competence encompasses the safe, critical and responsible use and handling of digital technologies for education, training, work and social participation. It includes information and data competence, communication and collaboration, digital content creation (including programming), security (including digital wellbeing and cybersecurity skills), and problem solving.” (European Commission, 2018, 4). From the various definitions of digital competence, it is clear that digital is not a stand-alone competence that can be developed in a specific way, but a cross-cutting or transversal competence that makes linear development difficult or even impossible. In the field of teacher education and teacher training, much attention is paid to digital competence and its development. For example, Ortmann-Welp (2021) provides an overview of the changing roles and required competence development of teachers, Krempkow (2021), Çebi and Reisoğlu (2020) investigated how digitally competent students are in the first place, Gudmundsdottir and Hatlevik (2018) investigated teachers' digital competence at the beginning of their teaching career, Rubach and Lazarides' (2019) study leads to a self-assessment scale of student teachers' digital competence, Lázaro-Cantabrana et. al (2019) focused on the knowledge component, Eichhorn and Tillmann (2018) focus on the necessary digital competence of university teachers and Frischherz on digital competence in the field of science (2018), Becker et al. (2020) present an orientation framework for the development of digital competence of universities of applied sciences, just to name a few. Most studies are either based on self-assessment by participants or are designed as smaller case studies. There are numerous attempts to define digital competence within the framework of a competence model. The two best known models are the TPACK and SAMR models. Mishra and Koehler's 2006 TPACK (Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge Framework) model, which is an extension of Shulman's (1986) concept, describes different types of knowledge that teachers need to successfully integrate technologies into the classroom. The model emphasises the interrelationships among the pedagogical, technological, and content knowledge that teachers must balance to create a technology-enhanced and successful learning environment (Mishra and Koehler 1025). The TPACK model consists of seven knowledge domains, with TPACK knowledge representing the intersection of all domains. Puentedura's 2006 SAMR model, modified in 2013, has a stage-like structure and includes four stages (replacement, enhancement, modification, and reassignment) that show teachers how to transform analogue learning materials into digital learning tasks. The model provides teachers with a way to analyse, systematically develop, and reflect on their own use of digital tools. Another research aspect of digital competence development is the attempt to capture, model and systematise the digital competence of individuals. The most well-known reference framework across Europe is called DigCompEdu or Digital Competence Framework for Educators (Redecker 2017). The design of this framework was adopted for our university course. The DigCompEdu competency framework aims to capture the competencies that a digital professional teacher needs in everyday life for meaningful use of digital media and targets teachers at all levels of education with the intention of supporting them in developing and assessing their own digital competence. The framework is based on a model that defines three overarching areas of competence: Teachers' Professional Competencies, Teachers' Pedagogical and Didactic Competencies, and Learners' Competencies, which are in turn divided into six subordinate areas. In the compulsory internship at elementary and secondary schools, future teachers are expected not only to have professional and didactic competencies, but also strong digital competence in planning and delivering modern instruction in German as a foreign language. Although today's students are digital natives, it is not a given that they will also automatically have digital competence for teaching a subject. When planning the course, the goal was to acquire the basic competencies to prepare future teachers for digital challenges in the real world. An attempt was made to achieve the highest possible level according to DigCompEdu. The knowledge and competencies of the future teachers targeted by the course were also immediately tested in practise during the 2020/2021 academic year due to the Corona pandemic. The course ICT in Teaching German as a foreign language, which is evaluated with three credits, is designed for 45 contact hours, of which 15 hours are organised as lectures and 30 hours as exercises. Self-study accounts for 45 hours. In order to find out how effective the design of the course and the activities planned in the course were for developing digital competence for teaching and learning and how future teachers perceive their digital competence, the quantitative research method, namely a survey, was used to investigate this question. Following Tondeur et. al. (2017) and DigCompEdu (Redecker 2017), an online questionnaire was created with 19 statements, asking respondents to express their agreement on a five-point Likert scale and also to rate their digital competence with DigCompEdu in teaching and learning. Twenty-two MA future teachers (18 women and 4 men) who completed all or part of the school internship online and took the ICT in Teaching German as a Foreign Language course in the 2020/2021 school year participated in the online survey. This represents 95% of the total cohort. The results in the area of teaching show that student teachers rate the development of their digital competence very highly in all aspects listed. The results in the area of learning show that after the course, the student teachers are able to support learners in their search for data and promote a critical approach to data. In the learning process, they are able to help learners organise and structure data and process data. In addition, the future teachers were asked to rate their digital competence in teaching and learning using the DigCompEdu grid (Redecker, 36). Of the 22 future teachers, 13 future teachers assessed themselves at the B1 level, five at the B2 level, three future teachers assumed they were already at the C1 level, and one person assessed themselves at the A2 level. Although a self-assessment tool has its limitations and does not indicate whether the self-assessments actually correspond to their digital knowledge, it can be inferred that the future teachers are quite confident about their own digital competence and do not feel let down by higher education. According to the survey, the course proved to be a successful dovetailing of theory and practise, enabling future teachers to acquire sufficient digital competence for beginners in both areas (learning and teaching). The self-assessment shows that they are able to plan and design lessons and integrate digital media into various learning processes. They can create collaborative learning opportunities and are able to promote self-directed learning. Future teachers will be able to communicate successfully using digital media. They are less digitally literate in the area of assessing learning outcomes. Although today's students belong to the generation of digital natives, they do not automatically have highly developed digital competence that they can easily apply in their professional lives, nor should it go unmentioned that digital competence varies widely among future teachers. For this reason, designing the course in the context of teacher training is more than necessary. © 2022 The Author(s) Published by Intellect Ltd. Article.},

abstract={Metacognitive reading strategies are believed to have a positive impact on students' reading and overall English competence. This study investigated the teaching and learning of these strategies in an average university in China. 111 students and their teacher were investigated via questionnaires and interviews after their first specialized English reading course. Descriptive and correlative statistical analyses were conducted via SPSS to reveal (a)the students' and (b)teacher's level of metacognitive reading strategies, (c)the frequency of using the strategies in class, and (d)the correlation between the three factors. It is found that the students' level of metacognitive reading strategies is at a medium level, while the teacher's level of the strategies and the frequency of teaching them are relatively high. However, the teacher's high level of certain metacognitive reading strategies does not ensure frequent application of them in teaching, and the frequent instruction of certain strategies does not guarantee a high level of the strategies acquired by students. Teachers are recommended to focus on teaching monitoring and adjustment strategies, as a relatively high correlation was found between students' level of these strategies and their frequency of teaching. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Learning analytics has developed into a powerful tool for discovering unforeseen patterns in educational data and forecasting students' academic success. In order to anticipate the final exam grades of students studying software engineering, this study suggests a learning analytics framework based on machine learning algorithms, using component grades as the source data. The dataset included the academic performance grades of 1475 students who enrolled in a private university for a year to take a Java Web Programming course. To estimate the students' final test grades, the Naive Bayes and Decision Tree algorithms' performances―which are among the machine learning algorithms were calculated and compared. A multitude of features, including the assignment, practical exam, two progress test, two workshop, and final exam, were used to make the predictions. Such data-driven research is crucial for developing a framework for learning analytics in higher education and for influencing decision-making. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={This Research Full Paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) investigating predictive programming skills and strategies to foster and measure such skills. Predictive skills are specific skills that precede a milestone or the development of other more structured skills, in this case, skills that precede programming skills. Introductory Programming Courses (CS1) feature students with a wide range of skill levels. This difference causes educators to get lost when formulating their practices to teach such a diverse group. There is no clear vision about what previous skills professors should foster before a student enters a CS1, much less which strategies to foster/measure such skills. Due to this limitation, we present/plan an RSL following the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham (2004) to achieve these goals. Our main results are a) Predictive programming skills are problem-solving, abstract thinking, mathematical reasoning, and cognitive flexibility; b) Different researchers use different approaches to teach programming skills based on different educational theories, teaching frameworks, or educational approaches; c) Several studies use the Classical Test Theory as a way to measure predictive programming skills. However, some universities have adopted other theories for this practice, such as Item Response Theory. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={First year engineering students lack of understanding of the field and skills required as engineers make it hard for them to grasp the efforts needed on their development to become future engineers. In the Chemical Engineering Programme in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), the Introduction to Engineering course was specifically designed to bridge the gap in students' learning and professional skills as well as understanding of engineering from their pre-university levels to prepare them for learning engineering in the university using Cooperative Problem Based Learning (CPBL). Among first year Chemical Engineering students in UTM, programming courses are particularly a pain to engineering students. Considering these issues regarding first year students, Introduction to Computer Programming (ICP) course was designed to be integrated with the CPBL problem for Introduction to Engineering (ITE) course. This paper aims to present the integration CPBL problem in both ITE and ICP courses and examine students' perception on the teaching practice. Students perceived that the integrated problem helped them see the application and usefulness of programming and motivated them to put effort in learning. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={With the development of technology and demand for online courses, there have been considerable quantities of online, blended, or flipped courses designed and provided. However, in the technology-enhanced learning environments, which are also full of social networking websites, shopping websites, and free online games, it is challenging to focus students’ attention and help them achieve satisfactory learning performance. In addition, the instruction of programming courses constantly challenges both teachers and students, particularly in online learning environments. To overcome and solve these problems and to facilitate students’ learning, the researchers in this study integrated two teaching approaches, using meta-cognitive learning strategy (MCLS) and team regulation (TR), to develop students’ regular learning habits and further contribute to their programming skills, academic motivation, and refusal self-efficacy of Internet use, in a cloud classroom. In this research, a quasi-experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of MCLS and TR adopting the experimental design of a 2 (MCLS vs. non-MCLS) × 2 (TR vs. non-TR) factorial pre-test/post-test. In this research, the participants consisted of four classes of university students from non-information or computer departments enrolled in programming design, a required course. The experimental groups comprised three of the classes, labelled as G1, G2, and G3. G1 concurrently received both the online MCLS and TR intervention, while G2 only received the online MCLS intervention, and G3 only received the online TR intervention. Serving as the control group, the fourth class (G4) received traditional teaching. This study investigated the effects of MCLS, TR, and their combination, on improving students’ programming skills, academic motivation, and refusal self-efficacy of Internet use in an online computing course. According to the results, students who received online TR significantly enhanced their programming design skills and their refusal self-efficacy of Internet use a cloud classroom. However, the expected effects of MCLS on developing students’ programming skills, academic motivation, and refusal self-efficacy of Internet use were not found in this study. The teaching strategy of integrating MCLS and TR in an online programming course in this study can serve as a reference for educators when conducting online, blended, or flipped courses during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Computer Science students need to acquire both theoretical and practical use of the knowledge that is covered by the subjects or courses of their degrees. However, sometimes they attend lectures about theoretical concepts that they cannot apply with real development tools that are part of the industry. Therefore, we believe that students have to start working as soon as possible in a similar way to the one they will use in their work once they have finished their studies, considering each course or each deliverable activity as a software development project. This paper describes the solutions adopted and applied to five Computer Science courses in two innovation teaching projects of the University of Almería. Furthermore, we present a series of support teaching tools for managing and creating GitHub projects as GitHub is the core technology for developing teaching-learning activities because of its widespread use. Each course manages its own strategy according to its specific characteristics (i.e., learning objectives, number of students, schedule or programming languages).

abstract={In response to the COVID-19 crisis and government strategies of quarantine, bans on gatherings, or even a complete lockdown, many schools and universities transferred from traditional face-to-face learning to online remote learning. This increased the need to develop web- or mobile-based applications to support e-learning requirements. Moreover, the need for providing academic institutions with platforms that manage e-lectures and e-exams during the pandemic or any other crises like wars and disasters.This paper provides a web-based learning system that controls course content in the University of Basrah in Iraq. The proposed e-learning system has several features, such as playing video lectures beside text lectures, providing online quizzes, and creating e-certificates. The system was developed according to the agile software development method with the Scrum technique and using HTML, CSS, PHP programming language, with MySQL for its database. In addition, the suggested e-learning system includes three authorized users: administrator, teacher, and students. Finally, an evaluation session was conducted to measure the usability and effectiveness of the system. The results showed that incorporating video lectures and e-quizzes into the e-learning system enhanced students' engagement and improved the interaction between students and teachers during the pandemic. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={While researches on programming MOOCs give importance to the pedagogical issues (assessment, using of integrated development environment, analysing performance or dropout in programming MOOCs), studies focus less on didactic issues. Thus, this study aims to understand the learning process within the MOOC of “Algorithms and Programming” delivered on the national platform “Morocco Digital University (MUN)” and presents a description of the learning strategies within programming MOOCs and difficulties encountered by participants drawn from in-depth interviews with 39 participants. The results revealed that to learn within the MOOC, the students used “cognitive strategies” in terms of elaboration strategies such as linking the content with prior programming knowledge and organization strategies such as the use of flowcharts to build step by step the algorithmic knowledge and “technical strategies” in terms of mobilization of videos and quizzes of the MOOC. The students have difficulties in decomposing problems, passing from the analysis phase to the algorithmic development phase and complex treatments composed of several conditions and loops. These results can provide MOOC instructors and researchers with insights into the study and design of programming MOOCs by taking into account the various learning strategies used by students and their experienced difficulties © 2022, International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning.All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={This presentation aims to report a pedagogical experience carried out in a course unit of a graduate programme in Computer Engineering at the University of Minho. The course unit, Numerical Methods and NonLinear Optimization (NMNO), integrates the first semester of the third year. The experience took place in 2021-2022 with 146 students, and it was supported by Centre IDEA-UMinho within the project 2Be-Learning. The classes were taught face-to-face (theoretical lectures and lab practice) and several strategies were implemented to support learning: ARS, padlet, videos, storytelling, and projects. Assessment was diversified and distributed over time to foster ongoing study and progress. It included two face-to-face written tests, four online multiple choice mini-tests (one per month, lasting about 10 minutes, based on extensive question banks), and one Matlab project. The focus of the presentation is on the impact of Matlab projects in the learning process. The projects were carried out by teams of 4 students. Each team could choose one of five proposed topics. The main challenge was to search for and select a real-world phenomenon where the chosen topic could be applied and solve a problem that should have an adequate level of complexity. The experience was evaluated on the basis of the quality of projects, students' grades and their perceptions collected in a survey at the end of the course unit. Results show that students developed their creativity through building bridges with other scientific areas and solving problems in innovative ways. Projects promoted their involvement in learning, autonomy, cooperation and the personal construction of knowledge, which are essential competences for lifelong learning. Overall, it can be considered that engaging with real-world phenomena creates conditions for students to connect course-based learning with authentic situations, analyse and solve problems from a multidisciplinary perspective, mediated by digital technologies, and become pro-active learners. © 2022 University of Minho.

funding_text 2={The first author started her journey of pedagogical inquiry in 2020-21, during the COVID-19 pandemics, by exploring a b-learning approach in a course unit of a master’s programme in Computer Engineering at the University of Minho, Numerical Methods and Nonlinear Optimization, which is placed in the first semester of the third year of the programme (Monteiro et al., 2021). Her project was supported by the Centre and the second and third authors acted as mentors. The goal was to enhance students’ motivation, interaction and participation in learning. Along with the exploration of digital resources, assessment became more diversified and distributed over time to foster ongoing study and progress. It included mini-tests and two Matlab projects carried out in teams with the main challenge of finding a real-world phenomenon for the application of a course concept, which implied connecting conceptual learning with reality and creating bridges with other areas of knowledge. The experience was evaluated on the basis of students’ assessment results and their perceptions collected in a survey. The new approach resulted in high levels of student engagement and satisfaction, promoting cooperation and the personal construction of knowledge, which are essential competences for lifelong learning. Nevertheless, is was concluded that the development of Matlab projects required further improvements, not only as regards support to students but also the evaluation of their impact on learning. Therefore, the project was continued in 2021-22 with a new group of students, and the purpose of the present paper is to report the improvements made and the impact of Matlab projects on learning. This project was also supported by the Centre and accompanied by the same colleagues as mentors.},

abstract={In today's world, almost every domain has certain and mandatory requirements to understand at least one of the programming languages which is defined as a way of interaction with a computer to resolve real world problems or more specifically for the implementation of algorithms. Language programming is a course with strong theory and practice. In view of the fact that C language beginners in colleges and universities generally report that it is difficult to learn well due to various reasons. Therefore, in this paper, we have discussed the development and teaching of interactive virtual animation of C language programs. The proposed approach relies on a typical recursive algorithm case to analyze the teaching strategy of virtual algorithm animation brought into the classroom, the application in the algorithm teaching of C language and the teaching strategy in improving students' understanding of abstract knowledge using computer C language program interactive virtual animation development and implementation of the teaching system is the research content. According to the basic flow of the interactive virtual algorithm of the C language program, a reasonable system structure design is carried out. © 2022 Lei Wan et al.},

abstract={The 3D game development process is significant in improving knowledge and skills, such as literacy of information technologies, computational, analytical, and algorithmic thinking, programming, and spatial abilities. Besides, the 3D game development is a difficult and complex learning process. Within this context, it was decided that teaching should be restructured to support the metacognitive strategies’ use skills of students. SOLO taxonomy was used as a framework for restructuring the content of teaching. In the literature, SOLO is preferred as a solution for teaching contents, which is complex and challenging to learn. The aim of this study is to improve problem-solving skills (PSS), cognitive flexibility, meta-cognitive strategies use skills and spatial anxiety in teaching the 3D game development, supported with metacognitive strategies and restructured with SOLO. An embedded pattern is used in this study. This study showed that experimental intervention influences change in students’ PSS and metacognitive strategies use skills. It is necessary to include SOLO taxonomy in content planning to increase the learning performance. It is supposed that the study results will provide an insight for implementers to design and execute difficult and complex teaching in computer science education and will assist them in developing different perspectives. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Learning community programs have been widely implemented in higher education institutions, including many accredited medical schools in North America. Learning communities have been shown to create a sense of belonging, enhance teaching and learning, and promote an inclusive educational environment that reinforces collaboration, professionalism, and wellbeing. Based on their demonstrated success, a learning community program was included in the development of Khalifa University College of Medicine and Health Sciences (KU CMHS), the first medical school in the capital city of Abu Dhabi and the first to offer a postbaccalaureate, Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Named the Falcon Learning Communities (FLCs), the program adopted the core values of the Learning Communities Institute and integrated them into curricular, co-curricular, and extra-curricular programming. This paper presents an overview on the development of the FLC program, its implication for both students and faculty, preliminary feedback from teachers and learners, and considerations for future work. © 2022 Hernandez Jr et al.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to explore how Japanese university students enrolled in a computer programming course perceived the effectiveness of flipped learning. The study covers two school years, considering the impacts of students' transition from in-person (offline) learning in 2019, to remote (online) classes in 2020. The findings indicate that there was a significant 34% increase in the number of students who described the online course as challenging in 2020 when compared to 2019. The majority of students indicated a preference for direct consultation between their peers and the instructors, in-person as opposed to online. Students' opinions on the efficacy of pre-learning also varied widely from student to student according to their own preferences, interests, and objectives. The results may provide some useful insights for instructors developing their own flipped learning strategies in this rapidly evolving learning environment. © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={This study investigates the challenges and opportunities particularly in current transportation policies that may arise to change existing mobility systems with the help of intelligent autonomous vehicle (IAV) technologies. India is already one of the highest levels of population, so all this leading to a massive increase in road traffic which leads to serious issues such as permanent traffic jams increased air pollution at harmful levels, accidents, or even human losses. Hence, technology and transportation infrastructure providers are needed to provide safer, large scalable, better flexible, and low-cost effective solutions to all these problems. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the relevant literature and explores intelligent transportation systems (ITS) which is one of the best solutions, and this offers traffic monitoring, guidance, or alerting by communication capabilities in between vehicles to avoid any accidents in terms of safety elements (Litman in Autonomous vehicle implementation predictions implications for transport planning, 2018; Pino et al. in IEEE Access 6:17527–17532, 2018; Bagloee et al. in J Mod Transp 24(4):284–303, 2016; Aazam et al. in IEEE Commun Mag, 2018 (in press); Gong et al. in IEEE Trans Intell Transp Syst 19:390–401, 2017; Miettinen in Evolutionary algorithms in engineering and computer science: recent advances in genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, evolutionary programming, GE.

CoRR, 2018) [1–15]. So it is important to do the improvement in new vehicular automation methods. It must have its organizations, specialists, and foundations to the center for their safe and successive journey under enhancing street security and traveling comfort which is the prime need of nowadays (Lian et al. in Channel models a non-stationary 3-D wideband GBSM for HAP-MIMO communication systems, 1128; Du et al. in Resource allocation in vehicular networks based on dual-side cost minimization, 1079; Gonzalez-Martín et al. in Analytical models of the performance of C-V2X mode 4 vehicular communications, 1155; Wei et al. in IEEE Trans Veh Technol; Wang et al. in Optimizing content dissemination for real-time traffic management in large-scale internet of vehicle systems, 1093; Jo et al. in Image-to-image learning to predict traffic speeds by considering area-wide spatio-temporal dependencies; Vehicle automation IEEE 2019: collision avoidance intelligent vehicles system vehicle-to-everything; Du et al. in Design and assessment of an electric vehicle power train model based on real-world driving and charging cycles, 1178; Peng et al. in Connected vehicle series vehicular communications: a network layer perspective, 1064; Wei et al. in An integrated longitudinal and lateral vehicle following control system with radar and vehicle-to-vehicle communication, 1116) [16–25]. All over the world, currently automobile manufacturers are mainly focusing on developing, exhibiting, producing, and promoting new vehicle features with advance controlled strategies that could make possible the exchange of information with self-organized robotics and try to interfaces with new algorithms into the smart automobile world (Self-driving cars: the next revolution kpmg.com | cargroup.org CAR (car centre for automotive research); Hasan et al. in IEEE Access 6:20371–20389, 2018; Guerrero-ibanez et al. in IEEE Wirel Commun 22:122–128, 2015; Li et al. in IEEE Trans Veh Technol, 2017; Abdelhamid et al. in IEEE Trans Intell Transp Syst 99:1–14, 2017; Jo et al. in Image-to-image learning to predict traffic speeds by considering area-wide spatio-temporal dependencies, 1188; Tan and Hu in IEEE Trans Veh Technol; Garcia-Garcia et al. in Appl Soft Comput 70:41–65, 2018; Xiao et al. in Inf Sci 432:543–558, 2018; Favarò et al. in Presented at PSAM Topical 2017 on human reliability, quantitative human factors, and risk management, Munich, Germany, 7th–9th June 2017) [26–35]. The vision of this paper is to provide a multimodal transportation system that could overview all the recent research work in the field of interconnected transportation environment giving help to millions of vehicles that are facing traffic problems and safety issues. To this end, we propose smart automated connected vehicles with the help of intelligent transport systems (ITS) and can provide various application services to improve the safety, efficiency, reliability, and comfort of the driving system (Autonomous cars: past, present and future—a review of the developments in the last century, the present scenario and the expected future of autonomous vehicle technology, Jan 2015 with 15,903; Autonomous vehicles UF: automated guided vehicles autonomous cars autonomous driving autonomous trucks unmanned autonomous vehicle BT: autonomous systems intelligent vehicles RT: artificial intelligence mechatronics multi-agent systems vehicular automation NT: unmanned autonomous vehicles, by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), 2019; Int J Inf Commun Comput Technol, Jagan Institute of Management Studies, New Delhi Article, Jan 2016; Proceedings of 2014 RAECS UIET, Panjab University Chandigarh, 06–08 Mar 2014; Future Internet J, Published: 24 Jan 2019; Martin-Vega et al. in IEEE Trans Veh Technol 67:3069–3084, 2018; Bazzi et al. in IEEE Trans Wirel Commun 17:2402–2416, 2018; Noor-A-Rahim et al. in IEEE Access 6:23786–23799, 2018;Technical report, IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, USA, 2006; Bazzi et al. in IEEE Access 6:71685–71698, 2018) [36–45]. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The study proposed an inquiry-based integrated STEM activity to guide students in game design and investigated its impact on student's perceptions of learning science and computer programming. The participants were 49 university students who participated in Web game design programming course. The results showed that the activity reduced students' conception of test-to-learn, and enhanced their surface and deep learning motivation and deep strategy in learning science. Moreover, students perceived a higher computer programming self-efficacy in terms of logical thinking, algorithm, debug, and cooperation.

abstract={Artificial intelligence covers the knowledge of philosophy, mathematics, computer, control, neurology, economics and linguistics, and involves the Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data, edge computing, etc. Among them, the Internet of Things is an important application scenario of agents, and the building of the Internet of Things scenario can fully promote the application of agents. The application of artificial intelligence in education mainly includes two aspects: (1) teaching artificial intelligence by offering courses such as robotics, programming and machine learning, or by using logic thinking related to artificial intelligence to solve problems; (2) leading the systematic reform of education, such as intelligent perception, intelligent educational evaluation, intelligent recommendation of digital educational resources, and personalized learning. The application of artificial intelligence technology in MICE teaching is realized by introducing seven key technologies such as machine learning, knowledge map, natural language processing, humancomputer interaction, computer vision, biometric identification and AR/VR in teaching activities. Moreover, the introduction of artificial intelligence into the field of education can promote the development and supply of intelligent systems and tools, such as intelligent learning systems, virtual and real learning environments, intelligent education assistants, and the construction of an intelligent education environment. At present, artificial intelligence education products are rapidly entering schools and classrooms, which provides support for teachers to use artificial intelligence technology to achieve teaching innovation. In this paper, artificial intelligence technology is used as a means to put forward the application strategy of artificial intelligence in the new finance and economics education by studying the new finance and economics MICE major of Hebei University of Economics and Business. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={The programming language Python is simple and easy to learn and is used for students with no prior background in programming. Several colleges and universities teach Python to students who are learning a programming language for the first time. In this paper, we present a curricular model for introducing, through active learning strategies, data analytics concepts and applications into an introductory computer science course for non-majors. We have designed the course to use a variety of hands-on laboratory projects that use the Python programming language and associated tools. While introducing students to an important research area, we believe the use of these projects improves students' learning experiences, enables them to apply and relate fundamental computational thinking concepts of algorithmic reasoning, data representation, and computational efficiency to data analytics problems. Assessment results show that introducing data analytics concepts and applications through active learning strategies enhanced students' computing capability to solve problems. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Specialized literature shows evidence that students in introductory courses fail to develop basic programming skills, a circumstance that may contribute, to some extent, to the high early dropout rates in computing degree programs. Efforts to improve the introductory teaching of programming appear unsuccessful. It has been suggested that, in practice, teachers are guided by their opinions and personal theories, leaving aside proven teaching strategies. This paper presents a phenomenographic study, which offers a description of what computer science teachers believe they should teach in introductory programming courses. The study was carried out through a survey and interviews with teachers belonging to universities in a populous metropolitan city. Teachers' beliefs about their students, the discipline of programming, and the knowledge to be taught, were identified and organized. The object to be taught was constructed as a collective conception providing the essence of what teachers think they should teach. The components of the object to be taught, as expressed by the interviewed teachers, were contrasted against the curricula of computing degree programs. This triggered the outline of recommendations for educational management in terms of curricula design, content management, teacher training, and teaching practice. Due to the rigorous method followed in this study, its replication in different regions and with larger samples is easily feasible and highly recommended. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) embarked on a study to identify where their engineering students were struggling over three years ago in an effort to address student success, persistence, and retention. In this study, the committee identified that students were ill-equipped in engineering problem solving methodology and basic engineering computer programming. To address these concerns, a new course named Engineering Problem Solving was created utilizing the Student Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies (SCALE-Up) method. This class has aided in improving student retention and persistence in engineering. However, to further enhance this effect, Supplemental Instruction (SI) was added to the existing just-in-time tutoring model already being utilized in the class. This addition was made in an attempt to increase student success within the course, especially addressing the mathematically underprepared and underrepresented minority groups within UTA's diverse engineering student body. SI provides a more structured studying environment in which students are led by a peer group mentor, known as an SI leader, in solving problems, receiving tips on good study habits, and other student success strategies. This is in contrast to the just-in-time tutoring sessions that are more “drop-in” in format, getting answers to specific questions the students have. This paper will assess the effects that these two different methods have on success rates in the course, defined as receiving an A, B, or C. Further, this paper will explore first semester engineering retention data in order to assess the effects that these learning resources listed above have made on the already effective engineering retention rates shown in the class as a whole. Finally, this paper will explore the effect these methods have on particular student groups shown to struggle more in the class than their counterparts, including underprepared students, and underrepresented minorities. This paper will show all students benefit from these resources as evidenced by increased first semester engineering retention and class success rates. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021},

abstract={Computing has become a foundational subject across the engineering disciplines with many first-year engineering curricula either including a course on computing or integrating computing within a broader introductory course. However, there is significant evidence that students have difficulty both learning and applying the computing concepts traditionally covered. Many different theories have been proposed for why students find computing concepts so difficult to understand. Some theories ascribe the difficulty in learning computing concepts to the abstract nature of the concepts and the lack of prior experience on which to build understanding. Other theories relate the difficulty to students incorrectly applying natural language structure to computing structures. It is this latter idea that is of interest in this paper. Learning multiple natural languages has often been associated with increased mathematical and scientific aptitude. Research also suggests that learning a new computing language may be similar to learning a natural language. However, little research has been done exploring the relationship between natural language acquisition and computing language acquisition, with even less on whether strategies employed for learning a natural language transfer to learning a computing language, particularly in an engineering setting. This full research paper aims to explore the first idea of whether a relationship exists between learning a second natural language and learning a computing language. All first-year students in the College of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Cincinnati are exposed to computing concepts through a common first-year engineering curriculum. To explore if a relationship exists between learning a second natural language and learning a computing language, student performance in the first-year engineering courses was evaluated based on previous or concurrent experience with second natural languages acquisition and controlled for by prior experience with computing languages. For purposes of this study, experience with a second natural language was defined as having successfully taken at least one university-level foreign language course (e.g., Spanish, French, German, Italian) either with AP credit (from high school) or in the first year of college. Experience with a computing language was defined as having taken at least one university-level computing course either in high school or in the first year of college. Non-parametric tests were conducted to investigate whether there were significant differences between students who had experience with a second natural language and those who didn't. Statistical analysis showed answers to the research question was inconclusive. Future work will involve further investigation into the reasons behind inconclusive results. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021},

abstract={Historically, Wyoming has depended on coal and petroleum as the foundation of the state's tax base. With revenue from these sources in decline, Wyoming lawmakers began the process of transforming the state's economy, with a focus on encouraging the growth of high-tech industries. As a first step, in 2019, the Wyoming State Legislature passed a bill mandating computer science at all levels of K-12 public education to encourage universal computer literacy. Based on this legislation, the Wyoming Department of Education wrote computer science standards, which were accepted in February 2020. While the Wyoming State School Board is currently working to approve those standards, Wyoming's higher education system (the University of Wyoming and seven community colleges) has begun implementing K-12 Computer Science Endorsement programs in accordance with the Wyoming Professional Teaching Standards Board. In the summer of 2020, Northwest College (NWC), a two-year college located in rural Wyoming, launched its program to a cohort of K-12 teachers. The endorsement program includes courses in structured programming, application development, cyber citizenship, and robotics. The first cohort will graduate in May 2021 and will be certified to teach computer science in Wyoming's public schools. This paper outlines the process for curriculum development, problem solving, and instructional strategies employed by those NWC faculty teaching the cohort. The experiences of the teachers enrolled in the first cohort will be a topic of future study. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021},

abstract={The integration of teaching and scientific research is the core and foundation of modern university education. Under the current performance evaluation mechanism of university quantitative evaluation, the university's "paying much more attention on researching other than teaching"education ideology is deeply ingrained. The teaching and scientific research shows obvious disadvantages such as segmentation, utilitarian, hollow, and superficial. This article attempts to start from the analysis of the mechanism of academic ability on teaching ability, and proposes a triple effect model of feedback, linkage and diffusion among them. It proposes the strategies to promote the teachers' teaching ability and integrated development of teaching and research on the basis of the core concept of "academic teaching". © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={Internationalization is a competing higher education strategy as compared to transnational education. The purpose of this exploratory pragmatic study was to examine if student learning was effective within information communication technology graduate courses at an accredited sub-Saharan Africa-based university. The central research question examined in this study was if student learning was effective, given that the domestic population likely possessed a much different learning style culture as compared to where the courses were designed. The unit of analysis was the causal factor relationship of demographic and pedagogy factors on student learning in several ICT programming language courses within the unique context of an accredited sub-Saharan university deploying a transnational educational strategy based on an American style college. Descriptive statistics, reliability analysis, correlation, optimal scaling multiple correspondence analyses, linear or nonlinear graphing, and multiple regression techniques were used to test the hypotheses. The results of this study indicated that student learning was effective, but vocational motivation did not significantly impact grade. Learning impact was higher when students disregarded the learning objectives, which the researchers were able to explain theoretically. Conversely, learning impact was higher for many students who avoided tutoring, which the researchers also investigated. © 2021 IST-Africa Institute and Authors.},

abstract={In higher educational institutes, the work in the ideology and politics of students is part and parcel of school management, education in ideology and politics is the main way to carry out this work. The effect of education in ideology and politics has been improved by optimization of courses, reform in teaching and other approaches conducted by majority of colleges and universities. However, they give more efforts in teaching process, ignoring the improvement in evaluation and the construction of assessment system. The evaluation was made only by subjective comments of teachers and in forms of final term examination without forming complete system, which leads to the evaluation on political and ideological education was not scientific and comprehensive. Consequently, adverse effect has been caused on the lasting improvement of education effect. For the purpose to convert this situation, higher educational institutions are required to combine the principles of purpose, dynamics and interactivity of evaluation system for education in ideology and politics, and the strategies were proactively explored and perfect methods to develop the assessment system in combination with actual educational characteristics. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.

abstract={At present, many students in the Electronic Engineering program are looking to be partakers of their learning through models or experiments that they can quickly review in digital media. That is why we seek to implement spaces associated with the teaching of career courses through technology and heuristic simulation software; which allows the teacher to incorporate didactic strategies aimed at continuously motivating the student and offering a trend that is detached from traditional education and that allows, through these programs, the student to explore and experiment in the development and analysis of electrical devices and circuits. For this reason, this article seeks to present the experience of incorporating more remarkably, the use of Proteus Suite Design software in university education for students of Electronic Engineering at the University of Sciences and Humanities (Lima, Peru). These methods generate greater student motivation with the course and related subjects, which allows consolidating collaborative development spaces through the implementation of the experience and generating greater enthusiasm and involvement in the learning process during class sessions, achieving greater interaction and an opportunity for interaction between the student and the specific subject of the course, focusing on the knowledge of electricity as a fundamental basis for understanding electronic circuits. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={We will also derive practical solutions using predictive analytics. And this would include application making predictions with real world example from University of Faculty of Chariaa of Fez. As soon as student enrolled to the university, they will certainly encounter many difficulties and problems which discourage their motivation towards their courses and which pushes them to leave their university. The aim of our article is to manage an investigation of the issue of dropping out their studies. This investigation actively integrates the benefits ofmachine learning. Hence, we will concentrate on two fundamental strategies which are KNN, which depends on the idea of likeness among data; and the famous strategy SVM, which can break the issues of classification. Thanks to predictive analytics, we can come up concrete solutions to decrease this issue. Therefore, our case study was specifically limited to University of Chariaa-Fez, Morocco. © 2021 University of Baghdad-College of Science. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This article improves the traditional closed-loop teaching mode with outcome based education (OBE) idea. First, the outcome which is the core of OBE is refined in two dimensions, and a formalized learning outcome model is established; then, the exercise library is revised to support the learning outcome model. On this basis, an exact model is designed for OBE based closed-loop teaching mode, which adopts a four-level test and teacher-student two-level feedback operating mechanism. And the specific strategies of OBE based plan, OBE based test, OBE based evaluation, and feedback instruction ensure the closed-loop mode and OBE idea. OBE based closed-loop teaching mode combining two excellent modes is beneficial to the university course. Our research takes object-oriented programming course as the object, supports stable operation of the mode and also provides a foundation for informatization construction of the mode. © 2021 IEEE},

abstract={A general new methodology is proposed as a framework to extract critical information from within organizations regarding their internal value flow and the role of their stakeholders. Deep Learning techniques are used in order to efficiently classify and evaluate how this value flow can be optimized within an organization. Our development had started by presenting results of these optimizations to complex public-private scenarios such as space exploration. We now generalize this method to any public-private scenarios, and we present results of a case study: an application of this methodology to our University, a public technical higher education institution with complex connections to other public and private organizations. Artificial Intelligence is currently being applied nowadays in a variety of business models with considerable success. We propose a new software architecture based on the stakeholder analysis of a space endeavour, which can be applied to a variety of organizations.We first propose that the value chain vector should be considered in order to identify which stakeholders are most relevant. We state that from a strategic point of view, the identification and analysis of stakeholders adding value to the process should be the core of the design process. We optimize value loops, defined as value chains that return to the starting stakeholder. Some metrics can be defined and characterized within the model: individuals, companies, Gross Domestic Product created, public awareness, capital flow, etc. A Deep Learning Network is integrated in the software, with an easy user- friendly interface. Compared to our previous work, the deep learning core network is faster and allows for more accuracy of the different scenarios, providing the possibility of comparing different strategies with a fast classiffcation in therms of optimal characterization. Regarding our new case study of application, we show the methodology of how the relevant data was entered in the system, by using open data webs and APIs from official sources of our University. The results obtained show that strong links between private and public organizations are the best way to improve quality transfer of knowledge to our students and our society. An optimal path of value flow was found, thus providing recommendations to the governing board of the institution. In conclusion, our system can make critical recommendations to improve the efficiency of organizations in complex public-private scenarios. Specifically, this was the first deep learning core network including stakeholders' diversity, specifically applied to a spaceflight endeavour and to higher education. © 2021 International Astronautical Federation, IAF.

abstract={To improve the learning of Mathematical Programming, two active methodologies have been combined: Learning through service and Learning based on problems; methodologies that are the framework for the development of mathematical problem-solving competence in university students. The experience consisted of solving a real business problem, identified by the students. A quasi-experimental methodological design was used with groups of students who worked cooperatively. Three phases are distinguished in the educational intervention: planning, execution and evaluation. The results show that the students perceive the experience favorably and that they consider that it has contributed to relate theory to practice, to the development of their communication skills and to solve and decide in real situations. It is concluded that the combination of the two proposed methodologies combined with cooperative learning techniques is adequate for the development of competencies and the comprehensive training of students. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The teaching of computer programming has been a constant challenge for teachers at the university level, either due to the complexity at the taxonomic level that it represents or the abilities of each student about the generation of algorithmic solutions. Adaptive learning has demonstrated over time the ability to improve effective learning indicators in students, working directly with stimuli, changes in strategies, or content delivered. The platforms that have implemented adaptability are diverse and at different educational levels. This study presents the effect of reinforcing Java programming for university students through an adaptive learning platform. The results, through the experimental study, demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating adaptivity to a software tool. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={In the development of this research, styles and learning style models that can be used for students who learn according to their personal characteristics are described. The possibility of incorporating Neurolinguistics Programming (PNI) and neuroscience in the pedagogical mediation and construction of evaluations instruments for students of the Computer Engineering Career of the Distance State University (UNED), is proposed. The university traditionally uses technological tools such as Moodle's, Learning Management System (LMS) and its different applications, which requires students to develop different skills than those who attend face- to-face classes only or with some virtual components. The objective of this research is to propose the formulation of educational strategies that incorporate neuroscience and neurolinguistics programming in the construction of learning in students of the Computer Engineering Career of the UNED. Furthermore, it was found that learning styles and models are not present in any of the courses of the TIC and Engineering Area, which is why it is proposed on this paper, to carry out a test in a group of students to detail how they learn. Students learn in three different ways: auditory, visual or kinesthetic. Offering alternatives in pedagogical mediation according to the way students learn, in a group where the PNI is applied and then analyze with another group in which standard and regular strategies were applied will help to conclude if the PNI improve in some way the interaction between professors and students and the approval percentage of the course. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={In the context of disciplinary reconfiguration of computer science in primary schools, this study focuses on the professional development of preservice teachers and on their representations in the field of computational thinking, particularly programming. Coming from three universities of teacher education (two French and a Swiss one), 135 sessions produced by 283 students were analyzed through the prism of teachers' professional knowledge of teaching strategies, curricula knowledge and computational thinking content knowledge. When looking at teaching strategies, our results show that the progression of activities and the choice of teaching methods are not completely thought through. The analysis of computational thinking content knowledge shows confusion between condition and event and between program representation and data representation. These findings are discussed in terms of didactics and professional development issues. © 2021 Institut National de Recherche Pedagogique. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This article describes the pedagogical strategies planned within the Computer and Systems Engineering program attached to the Faculty of Engineering of the University - before the COVID-19 pandemic, to attract the attention of new students and improve the retention of active students. In attracting new students, promotional activity is created based on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) initiatives, which target schools through academic events and competitions. In retention, we redesigned digital classrooms from the personalized construction of didactic materials used in the fundamental courses of computer science in engineering programs. In the short term, it would be a collateral benefit for the continuity of operations in the time of the pandemic. With these measures, the program reduced inter-monthly dropouts by 7% and increased the number of students by 77% in a five-year window. © 2021 Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions.

abstract={With the increasing hybrid blend of face-to-face and remote study in the higher education, finding strategies to keep students motivated when working from home is pertinent. This paper describes gamification in online learning environments, from the viewpoint of individuals undertaking programming education. In this empirical study, both qualitative and quantitative research methods are employed to investigate the hypothesis that gamified motivational methods would increase students’ motivation when learning programming remotely at a higher education level. This hypothesis was formed following an observed motivational drop regarding studies during the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with an observed consistency of engagement in the video games industry. An initial questionnaire with 90 respondents from multiple backgrounds explores game design elements as a concept and investigates the current or historical motivation of individuals working from home. Conclusions were drawn that participants’ motivation working from home were mixed, and that formative feedback and game design elements were perceived to be motivating to a learner, and these results were used to inform the design of two learner-centred virtual learning environments. These virtual learning environments were designed to facilitate programming tasks online in two settings: one being a traditional academic setting with staged communication with a virtual tutor, and the second being a gamified setting, completing missions and gaining rewards in line with a storyline. These programming environments were then used in a practical, yet remote, experiment with 25 participants who were current university students, graduates or recent education-leavers. These experiments gained statistically significant results, showing that the gamified system and specific gamified elements were found to be considerably motivating to the learner. This work therefore makes the following contribution: that gamified elements such as badges, rewards and missions do increase students’ motivation when engaging with virtual learning environments for programming. This work is relevant for programming and computing educators, digital education researchers and gamification researchers. © the authors, 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={The lack of workforce in IT is a global phenomenon. According to Informatics Europe, the lower numbers of females studying IT at universities are evident in all Europe (in Master studies, the leader is Estonia with 38%, while in Bachelor studies the level is even lower-the top country is Romania with 30%). Awareness and training programs are offered for increasingly younger people (examples include the Hour of Code, or the ProgeTiiger in Estonia) and they bring in many young talents, but they tend to be predominantly male. IT-related competitions (including robotics, programming, and cybersecu-rity) pull in much more young men than women (as seen at e.g. World/EuroSkills, Robotex, European Cyber Security Challenge, and various olympiads). How and when girls should be reached to introduce IT careers is a big question with no clear answer so far. It has been suggested that the most crucial career choices are made either in late basic school or secondary school-but is it true? We have carried out four surveys in Estonia during the 2020/2021 academic year, three of which involved students-the CyberCracker survey for Grades 4-6, and the combined CyberPin (Grades 1-6) / CyberDrill (Grades 7-12, also involving a separate study for teachers). The total number of participants exceeded 22000, showing the difference of interests by gender already from Grades 3-4. The actual IT skills and problem-solving capabilities start to differ at Grades 5-6, and by the 7th, girls have fallen about 20% behind boys. Moreover, in readiness to study IT in one’s leisure time and seeing one’s future in IT, boys are ahead for 35-40%. In the article, we will study the results and propose solutions for schools to avoid girls being left behind in IT. We also suggest some national activities that should already start in primary school. For the discussion, we will look at whether, how much, and how is it ethical to influence the career choices of young people at an early age-at the same time recognizing that if this is not done, the proportions will grow worse still, as the dominant mentality still seems to uniformly direct boys towards robotics and girls towards dancing. © the authors, 2021.

abstract={In order to improve the teaching effect of programming courses, this article applies network topology to the construction of programming course teaching platform system and constructs a teaching framework combined with intelligent teaching mode. In addition, this article takes the opportunistic social network composed of mobile smart terminal devices as the application background and briefly introduces the concept, characteristics, and application scenarios of the opportunistic social network. In addition, the typical message forwarding algorithm currently studied in this paper is analyzed. Taking into account the social attributes and forwarding willingness of nodes, in order to increase the message transmission rate and reduce message transmission delay and network overhead, two message transmission strategies are proposed to improve the operating effect of the programming course teaching platform.

abstract={Prior studies have highlighted the importance of adopting problem-based learning methods in online technical courses and engaging learners in problem-based learning tasks. However, it is difficult to design and apply problem-based learning courses in collaborations between universities and industry. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to introduce the IC-PBL (Industry-Coupled Problem-Based Learning) method, which aims to help learners actively solve real business problems that are then evaluated by firms. This paper reports the best practice of an exploratory case study of an online IC-PBL course conducted with a global-leading home appliance company (LG Electronics) in Korea. The procedure of IC-PBL proceeds as follows. First, the corporate leader and mentors present the specific problem facing the company and provide the class with relevant internal and external data. In this case, the problem was the development of a new smart home service employing a design-thinking approach and using data analytics. In the class, learners gained relevant knowledge in creative thinking, the design-thinking process, and some technical skills such as web-crawling, python programming, and text mining. Integrating IC-PBL into the technical online course with a design-thinking approach made the course more collaborative, creative, and efficient. Moreover, with the participation of mentors from the company, learners were able to actively determine what to learn and how to apply it to business problems by maintaining a close relationship with the mentors. This study suggests key strategies for the application of IC-PBL in blended technical courses and concludes with a discussion of how design-thinking approaches could be applied to PBL courses. © The authors, 2021.},

abstract={Several academic institutes provide students, as the first programming course, with an understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. This requires the teacher to face several obstacles due to the necessity to explain various and deep concepts such as type, data abstraction, encapsulation and different forms of polymorphism such as overloading, coercion, sub-typing, and parameterization. This paper proposes and evaluates a teaching strategy based on a flipped classroom approach for one selected topic in a second-year programming university course, Programming II, held at the University of Bari and focused on the OOP paradigm. This approach lets the students learn and train on their own before coming to class. Here, they will apply the knowledge during face-to-face lessons to elaborate, reflect and compare on what has been learned. We provided a preliminary evaluation of the approach through a quasi-experiment aiming at comparing two groups of students: one instructed by a flipped classroom approach and the other one by the traditional approach. Results show that the flipped group understands better concepts and produces better source code than the traditional group. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The specific learning difficulties (SpLD) are evolutionary disorders whose origins go back to biological and genetic alterations. Dyslexia is one of these disorders that occur when children learn to read. Due to the growing increase of dyslexic students in the university area, it is imperative and urgent to redevelop teaching materials that can respond to their specific academic needs. On the one hand, knowing the characteristics of dyslexic students enable the mitigation of the harmful effects of this difficulty. On the other, it leads to the improvement of the quality of the university life of dyslexic students thanks to the educational responses specifically adapted for them. With this in mind, our proposal aims to implement appropriate strategies for the acquisition of Business English vocabulary, a challenge for dyslexic students due to the intrinsic features of this type of English for specific purposes (ESP). This proposal is aimed not only at providing adequate professional training, but also at improving their meaningful learning process. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={At present, big data laboratories have been successively created in the major of economics and management in applied technology colleges, and many courses on big data have also been created in colleges. In response to the call of the times, it is necessary to actively cultivate all-round applied technical talents, pay more attention to and enhance the students’ ability to design computer programs. It is necessary to open a Python language course and design a Python language teaching strategy suitable for management students as soon as possible. Although the programming courses are more complicated, the students majoring in economics and management majors have the ability to accept new things quickly, have strong learning abilities, and can master and apply well. Combining its own teaching practice, it proposes an improved method of Python teaching. This article focuses on the study of the teaching strategy of Python in the economics and management majors of applied technology colleges. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

abstract={This paper presents a methodology to transpose a physical game into digital and an application to a case study. The case study applied the methodology to teaching and learning for a Data Structures course. The data structures studied involved concepts of stacks, queues, and linked lists.One of the main goals of this research is to confirm that digitalization helps working-class students to learn even having less time to study and experiment. We chose two different private university courses in computer science and computer engineering to take part in this research. The students developed a digital version of a traditional card game. The research bolsters the idea of first understanding the actual game concepts by analyzing and manipulating a physical card game. Using these concepts, students apply their results to examine the data structures perceived in the card game. Later, students develop the same card game using a conventional algorithm. Afterward, the development takes place in the virtual environment, using the Java programming language - we inherited the choice for Java from top hierarchies. We developed the method for transposing the physical game to a digital version before applying this case study. Using this method, students could work and understand each of the data structures concepts. In the end, each student extrapolated its applicability, trying to solve society's problems. As a bonus, students also researched strategies for logical reasoning and critical thinking. Both are necessary for card game resolution and personal and professional development. The results presented show that the students who learned data structures developing this method were able to apply the concepts in the course's evaluations, in their work, in their homes, in their daily lives, and their personal lives. Some students' self-motivation led them to change their social position such that they found themselves improving their quality of life and those around them. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={This review article explores a possible contribution of research on analogical reasoning to the problem of transfer in programming -in the transition between the learning of concepts in middle school and their application at university. The ease with which students construct programs in multimedia environments carries the disadvantage of translating these concepts into “real” text-based languages, probably because not enough work has been done on the problem level. According to research in teaching programming, students tend to have greater difficulty at higher levels of abstraction (understanding the problem) than at lower levels (such as coding). Comparing problems through analogical reasoning is a strategy from cognitive psychology extended to various disciplines. We suggest that its application in programming teaching could contribute to solving the problem of the difficulty of abstraction at the problem level and facilitate the transfer. © 2020 Universidad Autonoma de Bucaramanga.},

abstract={Microprocessor Systems Design is a core course in our curricula of both Computer Engineering and Systems (CES) program and Electrical Engineering (EE) program. It is offered to seniors in the autumn quarter and requires prerequisite on Computer Architecture which covers subjects including instruction set design, and assembly programming. As a continuation of a 200 level core course-Introduction to Logic Design, and a 300 level core course-Digital Systems Design with FPGA using Verilog, also functioning as a bridge to Senior Project, our 400 level Microprocessor Systems Design course focuses on introducing hardware and software design techniques for microprocessor-based systems. Back to a decade ago, when first designing this course, several processor families were considered and compared. We finally chose Microchip's 8-bit microcontroller PIC18F4520 as the study topic; correspondingly, the tools included Microchip PICDEM2 Plus board, MPLAB IDE as well as the MPLAB ICD2 evaluation kit. With the advancement of techniques, and to meet students' needs, we redesigned the course and switched to Texas Instrument's Tiva C series Microcontroller TM4C1294NCPDT-an IoT enabled High performance 32-bit ARM® Cortex®-M4F based MCU. Labs and course project were designed based on the Connected LaunchPad EK-TM4C1294XL; students got programming experience with both Keil µVision IDE and Code Composer Studio (CCS) IDE. To achieve teaching effectiveness, the main method we took is the project-centered pedagogy which has been endorsed at many universities world-wide. Each lab is regarded as a small project. After the concepts and basic principles are delivered and discussed during lectures, students need to find out all the necessary information by reading textbooks and digging into piles of technical documents, and generate the problem solution, which should also satisfy the project requirements. Taking into account ABET assessment criteria and changes of students group-CES students only in the first several years and a mixed class with both CES and EE students recently, we also adopted the strategy of cooperative learning. In addition to encouraging students to contribute to discussions on weekly small projects/labs, the final course project requires group work. Each group was formed by members with different background, e.g., one from CES program and another from EE program. Individual efforts were assessed based on group work evaluation to ensure fairness and equity. According to students' feedback, the cooperative learning method has successfully promoted students' learning and decision making; it also greatly enhanced students' racial tolerance and critical thinking capability. The contribution of this paper is that we provide a review to share our experience in teaching Microprocessor Systems Design in the past decade. Details to be presented include: (1) how we design our curriculum course sequence to ensure students get both the fundamentals and the hands-on exercise in one quarter; (2) how we help prepare students for their future career by teaching them state-of-the-art tools and techniques; (3) how we continuously improve our teaching methods by considering ABET assessment criteria, students' course evaluation/feedback, and changes in the students group caused by program's expansion. The effectiveness of our teaching is supported and verified by students' evaluations. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.},

abstract={The K12 InVenture Prize program has been creating the next generation of engineers and entrepreneurs through invention education since 2013. Its key components include teacher professional development, a semi-structured curriculum, an online platform for students to receive periodic feedback on their inventions, and a culminating state competition event at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). The program is actively trying to reach more rural areas by engaging urban and small-town hubs located within rural counties. A total of 35 schools, 55 teachers, and over 200 students from a new hub were involved in the program during the 2018-2019 school year. We found that the use of a regionally-centered, in-person event catalyzed participation in the region more than any previously attempted recruitment efforts, including offers of financial support and meetings with school leaders. Surveys were administered to a subset of participating teachers and students in the region, allowing for insights into how participants experienced the program in this setting. Outcomes assessed in the student survey include math interest, science interest, self-efficacy for schoolwork, and creative problem solving. Outcomes assessed in the teacher survey include perceived impact of the program on students, motivation for participating in the program, and self-efficacy for teaching engineering and entrepreneurship. Barriers and supports to the expansion of the program into this area, along with results from the student and teacher surveys, will be presented in this paper. Preliminary findings suggest similar positive experiences among students and teachers as those seen previously in settings located close to the hosting institution, suggesting that creation of hubs with local competitions may be a scalable strategy. This is an important early finding given the potential benefits of extending the rich, contextualized educational experiences engendered by K-12/university partnerships to K-12 institutions that have limited geographical access to major universities. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.},

abstract={The Introduction to Programming and Computation at Wayne State University (WSU), which is a required foundational course in MATLAB taken by six different engineering majors, was not perceived well by students, which affected engineering retention. At the onset of the course, many students were apprehensive about the material. From discussions with students, we learned that a number of students did not see connections between this course and courses in their major, or the usefulness of the material in their future careers. Beginning in Fall 2016 several pedagogical changes were incorporated into the course. The full study collected student data to see the effects each aspect had on different student groups. This work in progress paper will examine the student's perceptions of course structure and support based on their demographic information. Prior to this study, the course was taught in 70-100 person sections primarily in a lecture style. Topics in the course were only vaguely connected to their chosen disciple and thus students would struggle to find the benefit in the course. Many students had never programmed before and found the thought process completely foreign. As has been seen at other universities, this contributed to students' lack of engagement and dissatisfaction [1]. Females and minorities are chronically underrepresented in engineering [2] and industry is continually calling for additional engineers [3, 4]. Extensive research has been done on ways to increase student engagement and success in STEM fields [5-7]. The 2012 President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology report Engage to Excel lists these as strongly supported practices: small group discussion and peer instruction, testing, one-minute papers, clickers, problem-based learning, case studies, analytical challenges before lectures, group tests, problem sets in groups, concept mapping, writing with peer review, computer simulations and games, and combinations of active learning methods [8]. Studies have shown that female engineering students cite the availability of external support and group work as supporting their success [9]. We capitalized on that foundation by incorporating a wide range of active learning strategies into an entry-level class creating a more interactive environment to support all students' success. In addition to the classroom environment, student motivations and perceptions can affect outcomes for programming courses. Previous work has been done on several student factors. Initial motivation, goal orientation, and instrumentality were studied by Shell et al as contributing factors [10]. Bergin and Reilly reported on the role of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations and self-efficacy in learning programming [11]. Duckworth has reviewed the role of grit and self-control [12]. Data was collected in this study related to these topics, retention, and achievement of learning outcomes and is currently being analyzed for future papers. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.},

abstract={Term rewriting is a Turing complete model of computation. When taught to students of computer science, key properties of computation as well as techniques to analyze programs on an abstract level are conveyed. This paper gives a swift introduction to term rewriting and presents several automatic tools to analyze term rewrite systems which were developed by the Computational Logic Group at the University of Innsbruck. These include the termination tool TTT2, the confluence prover CSI, the completion tools mkbTT and KBCV, the complexity tool TcT, the strategy tool AutoStrat, as well as FORT, an implementation of the decision procedure for the first-order theory for a decidable class of rewrite systems. Besides its applications in research, this software pool has also proved invaluable for teaching, e.g., in multiple editions of the International Summer School on Rewriting. © S. Winkler and A.

abstract={e-Assessment is critical for the implementation of an effective e-learning approach. This paper reports the authors' reflection on e-assessment practices that were deployed in teaching a Java programming subject, and the academic performance of students at a South African University of Technology. The study presents a reflective analysis of students' performance records over three years and the e-assessment practices that were applied over this period. To do this, a research design that is based on data collection from the archive, data analysis, and analytical reflection on adopted e-assessment practices was employed. The study revealed that an effective formative assessment strategy is a major determinant of good performance by students when a programming language subject is being taught. The results of the study showed that significant improvement in the performance of the student cohort of Year 3, coincides with increased deliberate use of e-assessment for formative assessments. This suggests that e-assessment is a major enabler of an effective formative assessment strategy that is beneficial for students and lecturers. The study also highlighted the impact of other contextual factors such as experience and quality of the lecturer team, stability of the learning environment, personal motivation and aptitudes of the student cohort, as capable of influencing overall the performance of students in a taught programming subject. The lessons from the study are relevant to many developing-country contexts where teachers need to deal with students that have limited programming experience before taking their first programming subject at the university. © 2020 Academic Conferences Limited.

abstract={Computer games are nowadays very popular among various generations especially for children and youth. Being able to design, create and implement your own computer game is not only a big challenge, but also a high motivation to learn programming either they are high school or university students. The article describes the problem and the process of project-based teaching of programming at the university. The theme of the project is “the implementation of a didactic computer game of their choice.” The students can work on their projects individually, in pairs or even in groups. They can use any kind programming languages and frameworks which are suitable for implementation. Students can work in any higher-level programming language with a rich graphics library, or they can use a programming environment that supports game creation. It depends on the skill of the developer team members how to share the work on the project. They can individually address the different functional parts of the game, or work can be divided into separate layers. This way students can engage with problems they are the most competent with. E.g. one focuses on graphics design of the game, next one on the algorithms which checks compliance with the rules of the game, another member of the team developing winning strategies or looks at how the game can be stopped and resumed, how to raise the difficulty level of the game as power play value and how the achieved good performance. While working on the project students learn to work in a team and spontaneously and intuitively use the knowledge from the field of software engineering. It is their first experience in creating a software application together. © 2020, National Defence University - Carol I Printing House. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Collaborative learning activities have become a common practice in current university studies due to the implantation of the EHEA. But the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a radical and abrupt change in the teaching-learning model used in most universities, based on a face-to-face model. A rapid and unexpected adaptation to a new model of nonpresential teaching has been required, which has been able to be implemented, even in an improvised manner, thanks to the effort of teachers and students. Given this new scenario, our interest is mainly focused on discovering to what extent our students of the Computer Engineering Degree have approached the group programming tasks, which they must perform in a large number of subjects. For this purpose, we have carried out an experience aimed at finding the strategies and software tools they have used to address these tasks. The results of the study indicate that students have adopted a programming model based on work division or distributed peer programming, and very few have chosen to make use of synchronous distributed collaboration tools. © 2020 CEUR-WS.

abstract={This paper provides an overview of a team-based approach to learning physics in a second-level course for non-majors entitled Light, Sound, Action (LSA) taught at XX University. Designed using a workshop format, LSA provides students numerous opportunities to learn physics using a number of interactive engagement strategies. These interactive engagement strategies provide the backbone for the structure of the course. Using a carefully crafted set of collaborative activities, students in LSA engage in a wide range of experiences in a team setting. Within these collaborative activities are strategies aimed at enhancing communication and building community within the classroom. Perceptions about the team-based collaborative activities in LSA will be presented based on the responses to a short survey sent to students who have taken the course in the past three years. One emergent theme based on these results is that the community-building, team-based activities used in LSA can serve to transcend the classroom experience and carry over into other domains. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Our Research has shown that in universities there is no unified strategy to support intellectual processes related to creativity. Since 1998, Teresa Amabile stressed the link between the work environment and creativity. Her research meant “workplace creativity”. We wondered whether the principles of work underlined by the Amabile cannot apply to the organization called the University and if so, what are the particularities to be taken into account so that the university system becomes a kind of antechamber of preparation of graduates with these “finished” and “awakened” qualities for the entry into the creative environment offered by the organizations of the economic environment. For the curriculum, reformed in terms of the support of the creativity, are listed some design principles (the main ones) that are the catalyst for creativity. It’s about Fluency, Originality, Flexibility and Elaboration. The Analysis in the paper also assumed a parallel look of instructionism with profound learning. The Bottom line is that the instructionism practiced on a large scale today only accidentally leads to creativity. There are considerations regarding the binomial “part – whole” and the way his approach can annihilations or encourage creativity. It is brought as an argument for the reform of the Science of Complexity which gives us the ability to redesign the curriculum “learning by discovery” and “learning by direct implications in experimental projects”. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Collaborative learning has been gaining popularity as a teaching strategy that creates an active learning environment. Together with the use of e-tools it creates an instructional methodology which places more emphasis on the interaction of the students with each other and with their instructor through group activities. The use of interactive software (e-tools) to supplement the student’s in and out of class activities are intended to generate excitement and motivation by providing students with both heads-on and hands-on experiences. This paper will present an example of one such active learning model as described above that was used in a required three semester programming sequence of courses for Computer Science (CS) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) majors at our university. This paper will report that significant gains in student performance and retention rates were achieved when compared to classes using more traditional teaching methodologies. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The awareness of SRL is one of the key factors for successful learning and strongly relates to learning motivation, attitude, learning strategies, and learning performance. From behavioral perspective, seat location is an important factor that indicates effects on learning performance and a student's learning attitude. The seminal comparative evaluation was conducted in a C programming class for first-year university students, and the results indicated that these students gained significantly higher learning performance than non-system class students. However, no significant differences in the awareness of SRL were detected. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper reports some misconceptions that are frequently detected in students of introductory compiler construction courses. Compiler construction is a topic included in many university computer science programs. It deals with the design and implementation of programming and other computer languages. These misconceptions have been identified by the author when teaching the topic at the Complutense University of Madrid (Spain). The misconceptions are classified according to the different stages approached in compiler construction: lexical level, syntactic level, semantic level. At the lexical level the following misconceptions are documented: (i) incorrect identification of token types; (ii) transitions with more than one symbol in the state transition diagrams; and (iii) inadequate treatment of keywords. Misconceptions at the syntactic level include: (i) confusing non-determinism and ambiguity; (ii) considering ϵ (the empty string) as a terminal symbol; (iii) misinterpreting operator precedence; (iv) attempting to perform type checking at the syntactic level; and (v) grammar transformation errors. Finally, the following misconceptions are reported at the semantic level: (i) transformations that do not preserve semantics; (ii) difficulties in determining the abstract syntax trees of complex sentences; (iii) incorrect interpretation of how the symbol table works during the analysis of lexically-scoped languages; (iv) variable addressing errors; and (v) errors related to the translation of complex designators. Identifying these errors is very useful in developing instructional strategies to help students avoid them. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) embarked on a study to identify where their engineering students were struggling over three years ago in an effort to address student success, persistence, and retention. In this study, the committee identified that students were ill-equipped in engineering problem solving methodology and basic engineering computer programming. To address these concerns, a new course named Engineering Problem Solving was created utilizing the Student Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies (SCALE-Up) method. This class has aided in improving student retention and persistence in engineering. However, to further enhance this effect, Supplemental Instruction (SI) was added to the existing just-in-time tutoring model already being utilized in the class. This addition was made in an attempt to increase student success within the course, especially addressing the mathematically underprepared and underrepresented minority groups within UTA's diverse engineering student body. SI provides a more structured studying environment in which students are led by a peer group mentor, known as an SI leader, in solving problems, receiving tips on good study habits, and other student success strategies. This is in contrast to the just-in-time tutoring sessions that are more "drop-in" in format, getting answers to specific questions the students have. This paper will assess the effects that these two different methods have on success rates in the course, defined as receiving an A, B, or C. Further, this paper will explore first semester engineering retention data in order to assess the effects that these learning resources listed above have made on the already effective engineering retention rates shown in the class as a whole. Finally, this paper will explore the effect these methods have on particular student groups shown to struggle more in the class than their counterparts, including underprepared students, and underrepresented minorities. This paper will show all students benefit from these resources as evidenced by increased first semester engineering retention and class success rates. © 2019 FYEE Conference.},

In response, the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) performed a study and identified that students were ill-equipped to deal with the rigors of the engineering curriculum, particularly in the areas of problem solving, professional writing, and computer programming. Therefore, to address these areas, UTA has recently created a new first year engineering course that uses the Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies (SCALE-UP) method. This presentation will include an overview of not only student performance broken down by several student groups but also early surveys showing student perception of the effectiveness of this method. The results will show that these pedagogies are effective in aiding students to learn the principles of engineering. In addition, student surveys will show that students respond favorably to the teaching strategies and learning environment implemented in the course. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019},

abstract={The Software Engineering and Programming Cyber Learning Environment (SEP-CyLE) is a web-based platform to supplement standard course materials in CS1, CS2, software engineering, and software testing courses. In SEP-CyLE, students complete learning objects (LOs) and tutorials that cover topics which are not always discussed directly in lecture or in labs. SEP-CyLE also includes a series of learning and engagement strategies to encourage and instruct students. This experience report provides a brief background on the platform as well as information on how SEP-CyLE can be used by students and faculty. The paper continues by relaying specific successes and failures of using SEP-CyLE in CS1 courses at two separate research universities. The paper concludes with a discussion of the process for developing new learning objects for SEP-CyLE and their use in CS1 courses with an eye towards future modules and work to be done. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019},

abstract={One of our observations in this lessons learned paper is that there is underwhelming faculty development related to scholarship other than on how to submit and sometimes how to write proposals. This de facto service model misses everything outside of the proposal-writing process; which is the least important, but is often the most celebrated, rewarded, and supported phase. Inspired by national Centers for Teaching & Learning, and modeled after the emerging Communities of Transformation literature, we are piloting a Center for Transformative Research at Boise State University. The vision of our Center is to build and sustain an ASSERTive community - for Aligning Stakeholders and Structures to Enable Research Transformation (ASSERT). Faculty members from across campus were recruited to participate as fellows to explore what it means to be a scholar and how to move a bold and transformative idea forward. To minimize the energy to apply, the application process included an Instagram post, Twitter response, and/or haiku. Fifteen faculty were selected for the cohort of fellows. To ensure university-wide accountability, a memorandum of understanding was signed by each fellow, as well as their Provost, Vice President for Research & Economic Development, College or School Dean, and Department Chair. Once signed, each fellow was asked to complete a survey and participate in an individual structured interview with the PI and co-PI. These allowed us to determine the specific needs of each fellow, providing validation or perhaps challenging our a priori observations of risk inhibitors at Boise State that prevent germination of bold ideas. By studying the fellows, we were able to look at what may inhibit them from taking risks - personal attributes and beliefs, and structural and cultural issues within their academic units, the university, and in their academic fields. Based on the survey results and individual structured interviews, programming was developed and tailored to the needs of the fellows. An off-campus retreat was held. In addition to the off-campus retreat, on-campus workshops were custom-made for the fellows and included: (a) how to germinate transformative ideas by no longer seeing ideas as precious; (b) how to become an effective collaborator by adapting the Toolbox Project; (c) how to move ideas forward by drawing on the game “Chutes & Ladders” where the chutes represent common obstacles and the ladders are shortcuts; (d) how to manage time at work, and in life; and (e) how to classify, understand, and know when and how to implement intentional versus emergent research strategies. As a culminating activity, the faculty then pitched their ideas to university and community leadership. In conjunction with this pitch event, an advocate was assigned to each fellow to help connect their ideas to future resources. From our motivation to our faculty application to our custom learning community, lessons learned will be shared via a lightning talk. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019.},

abstract={In this research full paper, we present a study of a cohort of non-traditional students learning to program as part of an intercalated computer science year named Year in Computing at University of Kent, Canterbury in the UK. The study uses focus group interviews with students to explore their articulations and perceptions of learning to program. During the interviews, we used Bebras puzzles as a tool for students to reflect on their own experiences in learning to program. By observing the students working with the puzzle, some of the tacit information of problem-solving strategies became apparent. We see Bebras puzzles as a way to gain valuable insights that are not as easily available when relying on conventional self-reflection in a qualitative study. Another contribution grounded in this study is the proposal of a framework describing the students' developing mental models in the beginning of their studies. The results presented here are a first iteration in an ongoing endeavour of exploring students' development of mental models. We hope that these contributions will provide teachers and researchers with a new perspective for developing introductory programming curricula and to engage in further development of our framework. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The Academic Enhancement Program (AEP) aims to help students succeed in their post-secondary studies by incorporating learning strategies and academic reflection activities into core first-year Computing Science (CS). Initially offered in a single CS course at our institution, the AEP has since been run as a required component in several CS courses. It has also been adapted collaboratively in other universities, and is customizable to other disciplines with plans to expand into other departments. We have regularly evaluated AEP based on students', academic advisors' and instructors' perceptions to support the continual improvement of the program. The current study relied on both students' self-perception and course performance data in two sections of the same course, with the same instructor, contents, and exams, where only students in one section participated in the program. Employing linear regression, this study sought to determine what non-trivial factors account for student success, measured by final exam scores. We determined that 22% of the variance in student success measured by final exam scores can be accounted for by basis of admission, admission GPA, number of credits registered in, and a newly defined construct embodying student CS programming background experience. While our model did not include AEP as a predictive factor, we are encouraged that 77% of AEP participants said that they would continue to use study skills learned in AEP in future courses. Implications for further investigation of learning support programs are discussed. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

Through the live video and instant messages delivered by the network, the library can adapt various strategies for presenting the content in different forms (live videos, graphics, texts, video, and links). In this study, the integration of live broadcasting in English as a second language (ESL) learning is implemented in a library. Together with the implementation, reactions from the librarian, the teacher, the students, and library support staff were gathered. From their reactions, the participants were positive about the broadcast approach to learning ESL. However, challenges exist for keeping all students committed to attending the class. More interesting topics and the use of interactive activities in the class are suggested in future implementations. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={The purpose of this research is to integrate creative thinking strategies and skills into a project-based programming course for undergraduate students from information engineering and engineering and sciences departments. For creativity training, this study uses Mind map tool in the course to reinforce students’ divergent thinking ability, and for the projects, this study provides Arduino quadcopters and various sensors for students to program their controlled flights in order to enhance students’ programming and convergent thinking abilities. The course is taught to a group of 38 freshmen from an engineering and science department in a university in southern Taiwan. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods, including programming ability test, Abbreviated Torrance Test for Adults (ATTA), and expert’s participant observations, are used in this research for evaluating the course performance in a one-group pretest-posttest design. The results in students’ programming ability tests indicate that the programming ability of students is positively and significantly improved by the project-based course. From the after-course surveys and the expert’s participant observations, this study finds students, after hand-on projects, show strong learning interest and motivation. From the ATTA tests, this study can confirm the positive enhancement in students’ creativity after they participate in the creative project-based programming course, but there is no significant difference in the overall creativity performance between the ATTA pre- and post-tests. Suggestions are provided in this study to further strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of future instruction and investigation in relevant courses. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={We present a proposal for the application of gamification strategies to an introductory course in algorithms and programming, which is aimed at different university engineering programs. The purpose of the course is that students acquire skills in the development of algorithms and their implementation in a programming language to solve problems in various domains. The activities proposed for the course rely mainly on a platform which allows the presentation and evaluation of these activities. Performance in the field is low, with a rather high failure rate. Our purpose is to propose some gamification strategies in the classroom, based on mechanisms implemented both in the platform and in a mobile application that could serve as support for the course. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Among recent e-Learning Pedagogical Strategies, gaming and crisis-simulation games are increasingly used in recent years in university-learning and Blended-courses as an out-of-context effective tool for role-playing and education, especially in Law Schools and Business Schools. Gaming covers several sub-fields (war-games; Law School Mock-Trials; Tailor-made educational games in Business; playing commercials-off-the-shelf games; programming and code-learning; games to promote social inclusion of marginalized groups; Model U.N. and crisis-simulations) and are recently enhanced by the impact of using multi-modality and on-line education to apply several concurrent modes of presentation/communications, which are now being applied also in Political Sciences and Communications courses. In recent years, the much-touted future role of the Net-Generation of children and youth who grew-up with computer games should find a natural educational outlet in gaming, but this has been limited to the entertainment field, rather than university education, or in computer coding and programming, where gaming (both on-line and face-to-face) has only marginal effects, due to students' inability to grasp theoretical concepts, poor preparation or poor motivation. Thus, despite already existing methods of gamification in education, its promise as a didactic method in schools and universities is still at its beginnings. This paper analyzes as case-studies the emerging impact of gaming simulations in Political Sciences Blended-courses at Saint Leo University, USA and in Communications courses at the Pedagogical University of Kraków, Poland. © Copyright 2019 IADIS Press All rights reserved.},

abstract={According to Jeannette Wing computational thinking involves problem solving, system design and understanding of human behavior, making use of the fundamental concepts of informatics, thus, it means that boys and girls acquire skills to solve problems in different contexts through informatics and software programming in different devices. For the purpose of supporting the initiatives to strengthen the development of computational thinking, the Software engineering research and development group (IDIS) of the University of Cauca, in 2012 formalized the Childprogramming model to support the development of software oriented to children, based on strategies of collaborative learning, agile software development, and ludic learning. Since then, this model has been improved, such as, the Childprogramming-G model that looks for the improvement of the ludic learning, offering gamification strategies for the software development process carried out by children. This article presents an exploratory case study where the ChildProgramming-G version was applied, taking some dynamics and game mechanics combined with the previous sensitization of the importance of collaborative work in children's work teams. From this case study it was possible to obtain more information about the collaborative processes involved in the teaching-learning process of the software development carried out by children.

abstract={Implementation of the principles of sustainable development, ecologization of the economy, environmental modernization of production and reduction of anthropogenic impact on the environment largely depend on the provision of qualified, economically and environmentally competent, conscious management personnel. To train these professionals, it is necessary to introduce in the educational process innovative methods and information systems, primarily, in teaching disciplines of interdisciplinary environmental and economics profile (ecological management, environmental entrepreneurship, modern green business technologies, strategy of green development enterprise, ecological economy, ecological accounting etc.). The article explores the problem of improving the educational process for the training of qualified professionals - environmental managers - by introducing into the curriculum information technologies based on national and international experiences. It substantiates the urgency of the formation of practical skills of using informational technologies for students of the ecological-economic profile so that they are able to quickly navigate in the information space and develop solutions for relevant ecological and economic problems. The article defines competences necessary for professional realization of future environmental managers in the conditions of ever-increasing growth of information technologies. The article also identifies the structural elements of the most commonly used computer software programs (1C: Enterprise, SAP, М.е.doc) needed for the formation of professional skills of green business managers and suggests methods for their effective teaching A business simulator “Strategy of “green” business” used for training green managers is proposed. Business simulator have developed by Ukrainian-German Department of Environmental Management and Entrepreneurship of Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv together with the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ). The application of this business simulator involves acquiring theoretical knowledge and practical skills in valuation, accounting, analysis and audit of the environmental aspects of the enterprise, analysis of its environment, modeling the green operations and developing corporate strategy. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

abstract={Department of Data Science and Business Analytics established in January 2018 in the College of Innovation and Technology at Florida Polytechnic University. Two highly innovative undergraduate degree programs are offered: Bachelor of Science in Data Science and Bachelor of Science in Business Analytics. Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured. New computational and analytic approaches to a vast array of forms, scales, and sources of data are now critical to research, decision-making, and action. The rigorous curriculum in Data Science program focuses on the fundamentals of applied mathematics, computer science, probability, statistics, optimization, and machine learning while incorporating real-world examples. Business Analytics is analytics expertise with a business focus. It is a cutting-edge program especially designed to prepare students for top jobs in today's technology and data intensive business world. The curriculum provides extensive instruction in the disciplines of optimization, mathematical modeling, probabilistic and statistical analysis, simulation, computer programming, database, data and text mining, and cloud computing. The curriculum also includes classes in subject areas you would expect to find in a more traditional business program, such as economics, accounting, finance, operations management, supply chain management, entrepreneurship, business law, negotiation, project management, and strategy. The curricula of two programs are intertwined by first year common and several common courses and senior yearlong industry project. In this paper we highlight curriculum development along with learning objectives. © IEOM Society International.},

abstract={Marine communications established between ships, between ship and land-based marine stations or between ship and helicopter services require the use of controlled sentence-patterns developed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to avoid language ambiguities which may generate a safety risk during navigational moments at sea, when the ship is berthing in port or when the ship is leaving the berth. In the academic setting, training and learning of this fixed compendium of English sentences involves a special effort. On the one hand, a given student can hardly train on his/her own, and needs someone else to simulate the interactions that take place in the maritime context. On the other hand, when training with other students, different English language levels come together and particular learners' strategies and learning pace coalescence in the language classroom. To address these issues, in this work we have developed the SMCP-Training tool for practising Maritime English course communications. This tool was used in two language courses taught at the School of Marine, Nautical and Radioelectronics Engineering of the University of Cádiz (Spain). Both the results collected after the tests were conducted and the students' impressions offer positive evidence about the benefits of its use as a primary resource for learning in virtual educational spaces and as a reinforcement of what has been learned. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Research reports using global data show that the failure rates in introductory programming courses average about 32%. As learners from schools join the university and enrol for different courses, they find the sudden transformation quite challenging. This makes it more challenging for first year university students, especially in difficult courses such as Introduction to Programming. As trends change with advances in technology, the traditional ways of presenting information during teaching and learning interface may not address students' needs. Lecturers and university stakeholders however, do make efforts to address these challenges by proposing innovative teaching methods. One of the common approaches that has been used profitably in certain science and engineering programmes is Guided Inquiry Learning (GIL). It is a form of inductive collaborative learning approach; where students are challenged to accomplish the desired learning outcomes in the course. This research applied GIL to the year-long Development Software 1 (DEV1120) course, which deals with basic programming principles that apply to all computer programming languages. The purpose was to observe whether or not there were more gains through a GIL approach in students' academic achievement than through traditional teaching. The research was located in the pragmatic paradigm using action research design and a mixed method approach. The population consisted of all the 49 first-year students enrolled for the course at a South African university. The students who volunteered to be included in the experimental group were taught using the GIL strategies while the other group were taught using traditional method. Both groups were assessed using the same assessment tools simultaneously. Results from these assessments, together with focus-group interviews, provided the core data for this study. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were carried out on the data: statistical analysis for the former (chi-square and t-test) and thematic analysis for the latter. Results indicated significant gains in academic achievements for the experimental group over those in the control group. © 2018, The Education University of Hong Kong. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this paper, we present new partnering strategies to pair students for formative assessment in a programming course. These strategies, collaborative and cooperative learning, are two forms of active learning. Both forms have been widely tested in previous classroom experiments and show evidence of effectiveness. This study focused the application on how formative assessment (i.e. a weekly quiz) is administered, rather than on learning activities in general. A collaborative quiz is one based on the idea of paired programming, a technique that has become well-received in computer science. This type of quiz requires the pair of students to program together, using one computer to turn in one final solution. The second method, a cooperative quiz, allows students to collaborate as much or as little as they prefer. For a cooperative quiz, students must each use their own computer to write and submit their own solution, but any collaboration with their partner is allowed. To account for student preferences for active or independent learning, these strategies were also guided by how students are paired. To do this, the Felder-Silverman learning style inventory was used to categorize students along the model's active-reflective dimension as reflective, active, or "in-between" (neutral) learners. Students were partnered throughout the semester with a variety of partners with attention to mixing and matching their preferred learning styles to determine any effects of partnering. This study took place across three sections of a sophomore-level programming class in a midsize, public university in the western United States. The sample included approximately 100 primarily second-year mechanical engineering undergraduate students. The course is a required programming course using MATLAB. A weekly quiz was administered across each of the sections differently. This was done to test the relationship between strategy and assessment performance. Therefore, each week there was a section of students taking a collaborative, cooperative, and independent quiz. All sections were given the opportunity to take the same total number of each quiz type and all sections were taught by the same instructor. A standardized rubric was used to score student performance and compare across sections, across quiz styles, and across learning styles. The research question guiding this paper is: how does the quiz style and/or partner learning style preference affect student performance on formative assessment? Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to address this question. Statistical analysis was used to determine the average differences in quiz performance based on quiz style, mixed or matched learning style partnering, and the combination of the above. Several quiz sessions were videotaped, and this data was used to discern the interpersonal dynamics of different partnering conditions. This paper will focus on those results. The results from the statistical analysis demonstrates that working with a partner improved student performance over individual assessment. Video observations confirmed the statistical results, and provide more detail regarding the interpersonal dynamics of each type of student pairing. Additionally, we will present student narrative feedback. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.},

abstract={The focus of the research is the teaching module which incorporates manufacturing, planning mechanical designing, controlling system through microprocessor technology and maneuverability of the robot. Computer interactive and computer-assisted learning is strategies that emphasize the use of computers and learning aids (computer assisted learning) in teaching and learning activity. This research applied the 4-D model research and development. The model is suggested by Thiagarajan, et.al (1974). 4-D Model consists of four stages: Define Stage, Design Stage, Develop Stage, and Disseminate Stage. This research was conducted by applying the research design development with an objective to produce a tool of learning in the form of intelligent robot modules and kit based on Computer Interactive Learning and Computer Assisted Learning. From the data of the Indonesia Robot Contest during the period of 2009-2015, it can be seen that the modules that have been developed confirm the fourth stage of the research methods of development; disseminate method. The modules which have been developed for students guide students to produce Intelligent Robot Tool for Teaching Based on Computer Interactive Learning and Computer Assisted Learning. Results of students' responses also showed a positive feedback to relate to the module of robotics and computer-based interactive learning. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to use R Markdown as a teaching strategy to introduce reproducibility in a statistics course. A case study was proposed; in which it was required the articulation of skills and knowledge from four disciplines. It was found that R Markdown is a feasible option to implement in university classrooms due to its potential to reproduce research results in the teaching of statistics, though a representative proportion expressed reluctance to use it in other activities. It is advisable recommended to carry out experimental studies that include the use of a performance taxonomy, use of programming languagues in statistical analysis as a way to develop the critical thinking to the detriment of desiderative thinking and review alternative computational technologies. © 2018, Universidad Central de Venezuela.

abstract={CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is an ideal platform for learning parallel programming due to practicability low entry threshold limited financial cost and portability. Students of application-oriented universities are generally motivated to learn new skills like CUDA parallel programming. However, most of such students are facing a high entry barrier due to their comparatively weak theoretical knowledge bases. We design a teaching strategy of CUDA programming aiming at students in this category. Our strategy constitutes of two teaching methods. The first method leverages “concrete fading” theory of psychology. Under this method, students can intuitively and efficiently understand concepts of CUDA programming even if their theoretical knowledge bases are not sufficiently solid. The other method utilizes “self-determination” theory of psychology as well as gamification. We use this method to maintain the high concentration level of students. Effectiveness of our strategy is verified through comparative experiments. © Indian Pulp and Paper Technical Association. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Nowadays, many efforts have been made by various researchers and associations to study the factors to improve teaching and learning of initial subjects in programming area. However, there is a deficit in the algorithmic skills of new entry students at university level. This article focuses on the teaching process through the design of activities mediated by technology, therefore, it presents an instructional design strategy based on exercises to complete that according to the literature are feasible for novice students. The process is based on the model of Polya for the solution of problems, later the process of gamification of the proposed activity is carried out to generate the motivation and attract the student and finally the activities are structured based on the strategy of exercises solved at various levels of complexity. Subsequently, the prototype of the activities focused on the development of algorithmic skills is defined. Finally, the design proposal of the prototype is evaluated with usability tests applied to students of the Faculty of Computer Science. The results showed a satisfactory usability level, considering the comments of the evaluators, it is proposed to improve the interfaces for a future implementation in a Tutor System. © 2018 Red Universitaria de Campus Virtuales.

abstract={The design of a programming course in university is a complex activity. Usually, the professor uses several strategies and materials related with some particular topic in order to motivate its students. However, the teaching process must be adapted when the class includes blind students. In this scenario, the professor must be involved in the learning process of the student in order to find the best set of software tools available. This paper presents an experience in an algorithm course of the Facultad Regional Santa Fe - Universidad Tecnológica Nacional in which a blind student was enrolled. The set of strategies used and the materials developed to help the blind student are included as part of this work. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Programming is a major challenge faced by universities students at different levels. A significant learning outcome that emerged in recent years is working in teams, wherein two programmers can engage in pair programming to work on a single task as a group. This study examined the usability and effectiveness of using pair programming. We also evaluated the effects of pair programming on student results, time consumed, and number of errors, Big-O notation, and time complexity. The mixed method approach was applied by formulating a questionnaire and three different projects. We applied a novel strategy for creating pairs of students from different levels and courses in Tafila Technical University. Results indicated that pair programming is feasible and effective for educational purposes. Positive results were also obtained for programming learning, time, performance, and code quality.

abstract={The high rate of failures is a widespread problem in the teaching of programming in formal educational places. In the case of the Computer Systems Engineering and Industrial Engineering programs at the State University of Milagro, Ecuador, initiatives to encourage good performance of students have been promoted. The SCRATCH programming tool and the CARAMBA recommendation system are applied as alternatives to traditional teaching strategies. The reported research, which is based on the students' perception of the pre-university course, analyses the impact of using alternative tools such as SCRATCH in the teaching and learning process of programming. It is concluded that the application of SCRATCH + CARAMBA should be kept with pre-university students and also continue progressively with the other lower academic levels, it means in high schools and primary schools in the area. © 2017 Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions.

Discussion is an important activity in teaching. In this paper our main consideration is designing the discussion questions and group works so as to develop the students' critical thinking, cooperative and sharing spirits, and communication abilities in the cosmopolitan era. Typical questions that connect different chapters and help the students to understand the relationship between each sub-system in both field of view and aperture are given for discussion. We inspire the students to complete group works such as ray trace programming by cooperation and then make presentations. All of these create a circumstance for sharing thoughts and developing intelligence and knowledge. A poll shows that the students pay more attention to optical design than before and have made progress in conversation and cooperation. © 2017 ICO, IEEE, OSA, SPIE.},

abstract={It has been widely debated issue in the literature that learning programming requires students to have advanced thinking skills to be successful in programming. Having a negative attitude towards programming is considered as one of the important reasons which cause students to fail in programming. The relationship among students’ way of learning programming, their study approaches and their success in programming has not been explored in the literature in detail yet. In this regard, the purpose of the present study is to determine IT preservice teachers’ learning styles and their attitude of towards computer programming; and to investigate their relationship. It was determined that whereas IT preservice teachers’ year at the university exhibits significant difference with respect to their attitude towards programming; no significant relationship is found between their gender and types of their previous high school. However, it was observed that vocational high school graduates were more inclined toward programming compared to students graduated from other types of high schools. Additionally, it was found that most IT preservice teachers preferred deep studying approach the most effective way of comprehension of education materials since it uses the most effective learning strategy. Another positive correlation was determined between approaches of preservice teachers towards deep studying and their attitude towards programming. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.},

abstract={This evidence-based practice paper describes a living-learning community model for first- and second-year engineering students. Our residential community is designed to foster an educational experience that effectively supports and reinforces academic excellence in the classroom while infusing leadership practices into the physical and developmental spaces our students share. We do this by supporting academic foundations in engineering, promoting community responsibility, and teaching principles of leadership. Our programming model includes cohort-style engineering coursework, bi-weekly course reviews, and a collaborative service-learning project in which second-year students are project managers and first-year students are team members. The Engineering Leadership Community started as a retention strategy in 2009. Students who do not integrate socially and academically into their institution of higher learning are more likely to depart from college before earning a degree (1). In fact, student engagement can actually compensate for academic under preparedness, giving students the opportunity to connect to more academic support (2); (3); (4). By providing a physical environment for students in engineering majors to live, our program has historically allowed students to make academic and social connections early in their college career, which better supports their persistence. In recent years, students in the Engineering Leadership Community have taken multiple classes in the same sections together, including a one-credit academic success course and their introductory engineering lab. This method uses Tinto's learning community model, helping students to make connections between courses with their peers (1). The additional elements of service-learning and project-based learning have brought the residents of the Engineering Leadership Community into stronger leadership roles. Using (5) learning partnership model, we combine students' academic skills and interests in engineering with social justice and community service in order to produce what Baxter-Magolda calls "effective citizenship." In addition, the program design allows for a scaffolded educational experience, support students as freshmen and gradually challenging them to take on leadership responsibilities by the end of their second year. We use qualitative analysis to assess how students interact and make sense of different elements of this program. In order to live in the Engineering Leadership Community, students submit a statement of purpose and a resume. These documents, along with work submitted in the academic success class, are analyzed inductively and deductively in NVivo software in order to code and connect themes in students' attitudes and beliefs. At the end of the academic year, students participate in interviews to share about their participation in the Engineering Leadership Community. These data are used to continuously evaluate the program. Promising results have included continued academic success and retention, continued engagement in leadership activities within the college and the university, and a greater sense of peer-support and accountability. Students have also demonstrated more self-efficacy in project management and team leadership. What started as a program designed to retain students in the engineering discipline has turned into a multi-level developmental experience for first and second year students. The environment of both peer and administrative support has given students the opportunity to thrive in rigorous coursework, develop confidence in their planning, organization, and leadership skills, and connect their academic work to real-life applications of engineering. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.},

abstract={This paper shows the assessment of teaching strategies used to develop linguistic competence in seven preschool class-rooms following the methodology of Project Approach (PA). The experience involves 172 persons who belong to the childhood network RIECU (School-Centre for Teachers-University Network). The study was based on a qualitative approach and is carried out through a multiple case study. Various instruments are used to gather information: document analysis from the center and classroom programming, students' productions and activities, and group interview with teachers. The most relevant findings relate to: (1) teaching strategies that promote the development of linguistic competence are used, enhancing the students' communicative and active approach; (2) the methodology of Project Approach promotes a climate of dialogue and interaction in the classroom, an approach to global learning and research that facilitates the development of linguistic competence; (3) difficulties are apprecia-ted by the teachers to make a personal and systematic evaluation of communicative competence in the classroom. The teachers expressed some difficulties when defining evaluation criteria and indicators in accordance with the methodology of Project Approach. © 2016 Centro de Estudios de PromociÃ³n de la Lectura y Literatura Infantil, Universidad de Castilla-La Manc.

abstract={This critical ethnographic case study draws on Indigenous and minority students' process of learning English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in Mexico. The study specifically focuses on students who enrolled in a program called A wager with the Future. The aim of the study is to identify and understand contributing factors in these students' struggles with the process of learning English by focusing on factors that influence their investment in EFL. The research is framed by (critical) applied linguistics and post-colonial theories that favour the integration of an understanding of these students' socio historical context in their learning of English, and question (unequal) power relationships between languages and cultures in Mexico. The methodology was designed to ensure trustworthiness by adopting multiple data collection techniques, and to decolonize the research process by using participatory methods that featured researcher/participant co-analysis of the data. On a macro level, findings show that students enrolled in the program experience a relationship with English that is rooted in Mexico's colonial legacies (as expressed through discrimination in the EFL classroom), which has an impact on their subjectivities; specifically, they feel afraid and inferior in the EFL classroom. On a micro level, the programming adopted in the university's Language Department does not draw on diverse students' multi-competences in other languages. Nonetheless, some Indigenous students manage to invest in EFL by creating imagined communities, and appropriating English through the creation of autonomous pluralistic language learning strategies. © 2015 The Canadian Modern Language Review/La Revue canadienne des langues vivantes.},

abstract={During the last decade, additional teaching strategies have been developed by implementing Internet and Information Technology. One of the most challenging and attractive strategies is remote/online education applied to the traditional hands-on laboratories by two approaches: Remote and Virtual Laboratories (Ertugrul N., 2000, Ma J., Nickerson J.V., 2006, Z Aydogmus, O Aydogmus, 2009). New friendly development environments like graphical programming platforms, distributed and virtual systems became more attractive to promote advanced experiment based teaching. These environments facilitate the simulation of complex, expensive and dangerous equipment, the access to the conducted experiments for a large number of users regardless of their location and the improvement of quality of the experiments. In this paper, the authors describe an original way of using a remote laboratory, built on a Lab VIEW platform, in order to teach fluid power systems in power, automotive, and aerospace engineering in the University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest. © 2015 EUROSIS-ETI.},

abstract={The quality of teaching in university has a great influence on how students learn and develop. Nowadays, studies on teaching strategies are attracting more attention, but practical methods to improve teaching are not common. At the same time, most studies focus on how to improve teaching in theory. Teachers need specific and practical methods to help them improve their teaching. Classroom teaching is one of the more important aspects in higher education. Therefore, this article aims at providing specific implementation methods and recommendations for improving classroom teaching. The authors have introduced a method for improving classroom teaching using the pair teaching strategy. According to feedback from both teachers and students, the authors conclude that pair teaching can not only improve classroom teaching, but it can also increase students' learning interest, which improves teaching effectiveness. The significance of the study is that the authors provide valuable guidance for improving classroom teaching quality with the pair teaching strategy, and also demonstrate how to apply the pair teaching strategy in the C Programming Language at Beijing Institute of Graphic Communication (BIGC) as a case. © WIETE 2015.},

abstract={Computational Intelligence (CI) based model approaches, realized by Fuzzy Control models (FC) or models with Artificial Neural Networks (NN), are used as alternative concepts to classical approaches. In university education or further training there are on the one hand models needed which represent the technical system transparent and easy cognizable and on the other hand a programming tool is required that supports an easy development process. That includes a tool to verify the results and tuning the system with graphic functions under real time conditions, special as a debug system and a trace function. The experiences with the Fuzzy Control Design Tool (FHFCE-Tool) and four technical models will be presented. The methodical and didactical objective in the utilization of these teaching models is to develop solution strategies in CI applications, for example Fuzzy Controller, special to analyse different algorithms of inference or defuzzyfication and to verify and tune those systems efficiently. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={This paper describes Yourbook, a personalized blended web-based e-learning application being developed in the University of Malaya to assist students completing introductory programming course for undergraduate studies in computer science faculty. The name is inspired by the famous social website Facebook since students are very familiar with the user experience (UX) of this famous website. In our web-based solution we are using Representational State Transfer (REST) software architecture. We are building our services on the back-end using Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP), and frontend using open-source JavaScript library Yahoo! User Interface Library (YUI). We are introducing a new model to enhance the current adaptive e-learning systems by taking in consideration some learning theories which have been introduced many times in educational psychology. Yourbook is mainly considering help-seeking strategy which is identified as a very important strategy in self-regulated learning (SRL). Through the paper we are arguing why we have chosen this specific educational theorem to serve in adaptive systems, and how the system will be designed to achieve our goals in enhancing the educational process. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2014.},

abstract={The teaching of programming and algorithms consists in a big challenge, not only in universities but also in schools and training centers. Many proposals for stimulating this process were made in the last years. Previously to this work we proposed a semantic analyzer based on behaviors comparison between two programs, the model program and a student program. The programs compared are simple 2D games developed by JPlay framework. The JPlay was proposed and developed for teaching programming and consist on a framework that facilitates the teaching of programming. Thus, in order to compare the behaviors of two programs we developed a comparison algorithm between the classes of the model program and student program, resulting in similar pairs of classes. While in a previous work we proposed how to combine similar classes of two programs, in this paper we show how to analyze similar classes, based on a variable behavior strategy. These behaviors are identified based at an occurrence scope. Therefore, when behaviors differences are identified, our proposed system makes semantical suggestions about these behaviors differences found in the student program. The teacher adds and edits the suggestions using comments in the source code of the model. In this paper, we will also show some results of this comparison.
