Abstract = {Building connections between different data sets is a fundamental task
   in machine learning and related application community. With proper
   manifold alignment, the correspondences between data sets will assist us
   with comprehensive study of data processes and analyses. Despite the
   several progresses in semi-supervised and unsupervised scenarios, potent
   manifold alignment methods in generalized and realistic circumstances
   remain in absence. Besides, theretofore unsupervised algorithms seldom
   prove themselves mathematically. In this paper, we devise an efficient
   method to properly solve the unsupervised manifold alignment problem and
   denominate it as extending generalized unsupervised manifold alignment
   (EGUMA) method. More specifically, an explicit relaxed integer
   programming method is adopted to solve the unsupervised manifold
   alignment problem, which reconciles three factors covering the updated
   local structure matching, the the feature comparability and geometric
   preservation. An additional effort is retained on extending the Frank
   Wolfe algorithm to tacking our optimization problem. Besides our
   previous endeavors we adopt a new strategy for neighborhood discovery in
   the manifolds. The main advantages over previous methods accommodate (1)
   simultaneous alignment and discovery of manifolds; (2) complete
   unsupervised learning structure without any prerequisite correspondence;
   (3) more concise local geometry for the embedding space; (4) efficient
   alternative optimization; (5) strict mathematical analysis on the
   convergence and efficiency issues. Experiments on real-world
   applications verify the high accuracy and efficiency of our proposed
   method.},

Title = {An adaptive differential evolutionary algorithm incorporating multiple
   mutation strategies for the economic load dispatch problem},

Abstract = {As growing the demand for electrical energy, economic load dispatch
   (ELD) has become one of the most important and complex issues in the
   operation of power systems. Owing to the confined optimum convergence
   and the additional constraints, it does not proficient to crack such
   problems by the predictable optimization algorithms. In this paper, a
   self-adaptable differential evolution algorithm integrating with
   multiple mutation strategies (ADE-MMS) is proposed for the ELD problems.
   In order to improve the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the
   original differential evolution algorithm (DE), ADE-MMS has three
   extensions to DE. Firstly, four types of advanced vectors generated by
   the different methods are employed in the mutation strategies. Secondly,
   a self-adaptable selection mechanism for the multiple mutation
   strategies is implemented in the iterations. Thirdly, the main control
   parameters are updated according to the fitness value under the
   tolerance threshold. Additionally, an effective repair method is
   proposed to handle the equality constraints of the ELD problems. ADE-MMS
   not only improve the convergence speed of the original DE but also keep
   equilibrium state between the exploration and the exploration. A
   tolerance threshold for the main control parameters makes the original
   DE more adaptive. Moreover, the modified equality constraints handling
   method is benefit to meet the equality constraints and minimize the
   impact on the algorithm. The performances of four DE algorithms are
   tested on the ten ELD problems with diverse complexities. Experimental
   results and comparisons with other recently reported ELD algorithms
   confirm that ADE-MMS is capable of obtaining excellent and feasible
   solutions. It reveal that ADE-MMS has good potential to solvating the
   ELD problems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The aim of this learning exercise was to harness current interest in
   zombies in order to educate audiences about the epidemiology of
   infectious disease. Participants in the activity were provided with an
   outbreak scenario, which they then used as the basis of play-based
   activities. By considering the mode and speed of transmission, size of
   outbreak and prevention/control strategy, participant groups were able
   to define parameters of their outbreak scenario. These were then input
   to SimZombie, a computer simulation program developed by the authors,
   which visually demonstrated the spread of infection through a
   population. The resulting animations were then used as the basis of
   in-depth discussion which, in turn, enabled the consideration of
   principles of disease transmission and control strategies. The activity
   provided an opportunity to engage a range of audiences through a variety
   of different delivery mechanisms, including role play, workshops and
   informal drop-in. Learning was evidenced by participation and feedback.},

Title = {Adversarial Graph Regularized Deep Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for
   Data Representation},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {86445-86457},
Abstract = {This work proposes a novel unsupervised deep non-negative matrix
   factorization (NMF) model called AGDNMF by deep exploration of the
   structure of the original data. Compared with the existing NMF research
   results, the model explores the deep association of data and constructs
   accurate spatial structure from a new perspective. Specifically, for the
   purpose of effectively learning low-dimensional representations of data.
   This work constructs a deep NMF method to approximate the coding
   structure of the original data, which enables AGDNMF to learn the
   hierarchical mapping relationship between the categories of the original
   data, and learn the hidden association information of the data from
   low-to-high in the middle layer. Moreover, the model gives an
   adversarial graph regularization representation for the manifoldization
   of data structures to push away the spatial distances between different
   sample clusters. Finally, based on the mathematical model of the
   proposed algorithm, the optimization strategy and convergence proof are
   given. Extensive experiments and data analysis demonstrate that the
   proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised NMF methods.},

Title = {Auto-Weighted Incomplete Multi-View Clustering},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {138752-138762},
Abstract = {Nowadays, multi-view clustering has attracted more and more attention,
   which provides a way to partition multi-view data into their
   corresponding clusters. Previous studies assume that each data instance
   appears in all views. However, in real-world applications, it is common
   that each view may contain some missing data instances, resulting in
   incomplete multi-view data. To address the incomplete multi-view
   clustering problem, we will propose an auto-weighted incomplete
   multi-view clustering method in this paper, which learns a common
   representation of the instances and an affinity matrix of the learned
   representation simultaneously in a unified framework. Learning the
   affinity matrix of the representation guides to learn a more
   discriminative and compact consensus representation for clustering.
   Moreover, by considering the impact of the significance of different
   views, an adaptive weighting strategy is designed to measure the
   importance of each view. An efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to
   optimize the objective function. Experimental results on various
   real-world datasets show that the proposed method can improve the
   clustering performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods
   in most cases.},

Title = {School Personnel Experiences in Notifying Parents About Their Child's
   Risk for Suicide: Lessons Learned},

Abstract = {BACKGROUNDSchools across the nation are increasingly implementing
   suicide prevention programs that involve training school staff and
   connecting students and their families to appropriate services. However,
   little is known about how parents are engaged in such efforts.
   METHODSThis qualitative study examined school staff perspectives on
   parent involvement in the implementation of a district-wide suicide
   prevention program by analyzing focus group and interview data gathered
   on the program implementation processes. Participants included middle
   school teachers, administrators, and other school personnel.
   RESULTSStudy results revealed that in the immediate wake of a crisis or
   concern about suicide, school staff routinely contacted parents.
   However, substantial barriers prevent some students from receiving
   needed follow-up care (eg, lack of consistent follow-up, financial
   strain, parental stress, availability of appropriate services). Despite
   these challenges, school staff identified strategies that could better
   support parents before, during, and after the crisis. In particular,
   school-based services increased the success of mental health referrals.
   CONCLUSIONSOur study suggests that systematic postcrisis follow-up
   procedures are needed to improve the likelihood that students and
   families receive ongoing support. In particular, school-based services
   and home visits, training and outreach for parents, and formal training
   for school mental health staff on parent engagement may be beneficial in
   this context.},

Abstract = {Optimization plays an important role in many methods routinely used in
   statistics, machine learning and data science. Often, implementations of
   these methods rely on highly specialized optimization algorithms,
   designed to be only applicable within a specific application. However,
   in many instances recent advances, in particular in the field of convex
   optimization, make it possible to conveniently and straightforwardly use
   modern solvers instead with the advantage of enabling broader usage
   scenarios and thus promoting reusability. This paper introduces the R
   optimization infrastructure ROI which provides an extensible
   infrastructure to model linear, quadratic, conic and general nonlinear
   optimization problems in a consistent way. Furthermore, the
   infrastructure administers many different solvers, reformulations,
   problem collections and functions to read and write optimization
   problems in various formats.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this article was to examine the geographical
   spread of teaching personal and social responsibility (TPSR), the
   extensive range of new populations and cultures that TPSR has been
   implemented with, and to consider the resulting challenges of this
   growth. Method: Information was gathered from published articles,
   dissertations, professional articles, and program descriptions and
   systematically analyzed for program fidelity. Results: A total of 31
   countries were identified as having some level of TPSR presence, and
   there was a great deal of diversity in how, where, and to whom the
   programs are implemented. Discussion: The proliferation of TPSR will
   continue, and as this occurs, there will be increasing challenges in
   maintaining fidelity to the model. Conclusion: To meet this challenge,
   ongoing research, quality professional development, and the growth of
   communities of TPSR practice will be crucial.},

Title = {Northern Goshawk Optimization: A New Swarm-Based Algorithm for Solving
   Optimization Problems},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {162059-162080},
Abstract = {Optimization algorithms are one of the effective stochastic methods in
   solving optimization problems. In this paper, a new swarm-based
   algorithm called Northern Goshawk Optimization (NGO) algorithm is
   presented that simulates the behavior of northern goshawk during prey
   hunting. This hunting strategy includes two phases of prey
   identification and the tail and chase process. The various steps of the
   proposed NGO algorithm are described and then its mathematical modeling
   is presented for use in solving optimization problems. The ability of
   NGO to solve optimization problems is evaluated on sixty-eight different
   objective functions. To analyze the quality of the results, the proposed
   NGO algorithm is compared with eight well-known algorithms, particle
   swarm optimization, genetic algorithm, teaching-learning based
   optimization, gravitational search algorithm, grey wolf optimizer, whale
   optimization algorithm, tunicate swarm algorithm, and marine predators
   algorithm. In addition, for further analysis, the proposed algorithm is
   also employed to solve four engineering design problems. The results of
   simulations and experiments show that the proposed NGO algorithm, by
   creating a proper balance between exploration and exploitation, has an
   effective performance in solving optimization problems and is much more
   competitive than similar algorithms.},

Abstract = {Tag recommendation strategies that exploit term co-occurrence patterns
   with tags previously assigned to the target object have consistently
   produced state-of-the-art results. However, such techniques work only
   for objects with previously assigned tags. Here we focus on tag
   recommendation for objects with no tags, a variation of the well-known
   \textbackslash{}textit\{cold start\} problem. We start by evaluating
   state-of-the-art co-occurrence based methods in cold start. Our results
   show that the effectiveness of these methods suffers in this situation.
   Moreover, we show that employing various automatic filtering strategies
   to generate an initial tag set that enables the use of co-occurrence
   patterns produces only marginal improvements. We then propose a new
   approach that exploits both positive and negative user feedback to
   iteratively select input tags along with a genetic programming strategy
   to learn the recommendation function. Our experimental results indicate
   that extending the methods to include user relevance feedback leads to
   gains in precision of up to 58\% over the best baseline in cold start
   scenarios and gains of up to 43\% over the best baseline in objects that
   contain some initial tags (i.e., no cold start). We also show that our
   best relevance-feedback-driven strategy performs well even in scenarios
   that lack user cooperation (i.e., users may refuse to provide feedback)
   and user reliability (i.e., users may provide the wrong feedback).},

Abstract = {Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by novel Corona virus hit
   Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and resulted in hundreds of mortality and
   morbidity, fears and psychosocial stress among population, economic loss
   and major political change at Ministry of Health (MoH). Although MERS
   discovered two years ago, confusion still exists about its origin,
   nature, and consequences. In 2003, similar virus (SARS) hit Canada and
   resulted in a reform of Canada's public health system and creation of a
   Canadian Agency for Public Health, similar to the US Centers for Disease
   Control (CDC). The idea of Saudi CDC is attractive and even ``sexy'' but
   it is not the best option. Experience and literature indicate that the
   best option for KSA is to revitalize national public health systems on
   the basis of comprehensive, continuing, and integrated primary health
   care (PHC) and public health (PH). This article proposes three initial,
   but essential, steps for such revitalization to take place: political
   will and support, integration of PHC and PH, and on-job professional
   programs for the workforce. In addition, current academic and training
   programs for PHC and PH should be revisited in the light of national
   vision and strategy that aim for high quality products that protect and
   promote healthy nation. Scientific associations, medical education
   research chair, and relevant academic bodies should be involved in the
   revitalization to ensure quality of process and outcomes.},

Title = {Effectiveness of an Evidence-Based Quality Improvement Approach to
   Cultural Competence Training: The Veterans Affairs' ``Caring for Women

Abstract = {Introduction: Although providing culturally sensitive health care is
   vitally important, there is little consensus regarding the most
   effective strategy for implementing cultural competence trainings in the
   health care setting. Evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI), which
   involves adapting evidence-based practices to meet local needs, may
   improve uptake and effectiveness of a variety of health care
   innovations. Yet, to our knowledge, EBQI has not yet been applied to
   cultural competence training. To evaluate whether EBQI could enhance the
   impact of an evidence-based training intended to improve veterans
   affairs health care staff gender sensitivity and knowledge (Caring for
   Women Veterans; CWV), we compared the reach and effectiveness of EBQI
   delivery versus standard web-based implementation strategies of CWV and
   assessed barriers and facilitators to EBQI implementation.
   Methods: Workgroups at four diverse veterans affairs health care sites
   were randomized to either an EBQI or standard web-based implementation
   condition (SI). All EBQI sites selected a group-based implementation
   strategy. Employees (N = 84) completed pretraining and posttraining
   assessments of gender sensitivity and knowledge, and focus
   groups/interviews were conducted with leadership and staff before and
   after implementation.
   Results: Reach of CWV was greater in the EBQI condition versus the SI
   condition. Whereas both gender sensitivity and knowledge improved in the
   EBQI condition, only gender sensitivity improved in the SI condition.
   Qualitative analyses revealed that the EBQI approach was well received,
   although a number of barriers were identified.
   Discussion: Findings suggest that EBQI can enhance the uptake and
   effectiveness of employee trainings. However, the decision to pursue
   EBQI must be informed by a consideration of available resources.},

Abstract = {Undergraduate research is a valuable experience that increases the
   likelihood of a STEM major to continue on to postgraduate training in
   their field. For students from groups underrepresented in the biomedical
   sciences, a strong mentoring relationship during this undergraduate
   period is a key component in preparing them for the next stage of their
   education and can have a significant influence on their ability to
   persist in the pipeline. Although the ideal scenario to increase the
   diversity of the biomedical workforce is to provide more BIPOC (Black,
   Indigenous, People of Color) faculty mentors for our undergraduates, we
   also need to develop strategies to provide strong mentoring experiences
   for our BIPOC students when those mentors are not in great number. At
   Xavier University of Louisiana, we have used our NIH BUILD Project
   Pathways program to look more closely at the mentor matching process.
   Throughout the past seven years, we have moved from the traditional
   mentor, research-focused matching process to a student-centered process.
   The lessons learned here can be used by any University looking to craft
   an inclusive undergraduate research program to meet the needs of all
   students, but in particular a diverse student population.},

Title = {Discrete Double-Bit Hashing},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIG DATA},

Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Hashing has been widely used for nearest neighbors search over big data.
   Hashing encodes high dimensional data points into binary codes. Most
   hashing methods use the single-bit quantization (SBQ) strategy for
   coding the data. However, this strategy often encodes neighboring points
   into totally different bits. Recently, a double-bit quantization (DBQ)
   strategy was proposed, which can better preserve the similarity of the
   data. The hashing problems are generally NP-hard, due to the discrete
   constraints. For tractability, some relaxation methods were proposed by
   discarding the discrete constraints. However, such a manner makes the
   hash codes less effective, due to the large quantization error. To
   obtain high-quality hash codes, some discrete hashing methods were
   proposed, which directly solve the hashing problem without any
   relaxations. However, the existing discrete hashing methods can only
   deal with single-bit hashing. In this paper, we propose a discrete
   hashing method to solve double-bit hashing problems. To address the
   difficulty brought by the discrete constraints, we propose a method to
   transform the discrete hashing problem into an equivalent continuous
   optimization problem. Then, we devise algorithms based on DC (difference
   of convex functions) programming to solve the problem. Numerical
   experiments are provided to show the superiority of the proposed
   methods.},

Abstract = {Although active learning improves student outcomes in science,
   technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs, it may provoke
   anxiety in some students. We examined whether two psychological
   variables, social anxiety (psychological distress relating to the fear
   of negative evaluation by others) and academic self-efficacy (confidence
   in one's ability to overcome academic challenges), interact with student
   perceptions of evidence-based instructional practices (EBIPs) and
   associate with their final grades in a STEM-related course. Human
   anatomy and physiology students in community college courses rated
   various EBIPs for their perceived educational value and their capacity
   to elicit anxiety (N = 227). In general, practices causing students the
   most anxiety (e.g., cold calling) were reported by students as having
   the least educational value. When controlling for students'
   self-reported grade point averages, socially anxious students rated
   several EBIPs as more anxiety inducing, whereas high-efficacy students
   reported less anxiety surrounding other EBIPs. Furthermore, mediation
   analysis revealed that individual differences in academic self-efficacy
   at the beginning of the term explained some of the negative association
   between students' social anxiety levels and final grades in the course.
   Our results, obtained in a community college context, support a growing
   body of evidence that social anxiety and academic self-efficacy are
   linked with how students perceive and perform in an active-learning
   environment.},

Title = {Graduate nurses' evaluation of mentorship: Development of a new tool},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {54},
Pages = {77-82},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Aim: Develop and test an instrument to measure graduate-nurses'
   perceptions of a structured mentorship program.
   Background: New graduate nurses may experience difficulties in the
   transition from student to practitioner. Mentoring is commonly used to
   support graduates. However, there is a lack of published tools measuring
   graduate nurses' perceptions of mentorship. As mentoring is resource
   intensive, development and testing of a validated tool are important to
   assist in determining program effectiveness.
   Methods: A pretest-posttest interventional design was used. Following a
   critical review of literature and content experts' input, the 10-item
   National University Hospital Mentorship Evaluation (NUH ME) instrument
   was tested with a convenience sample of 83 graduate nurses. Psychometric
   tests included internal reliability, stability, content validity, and
   factor analysis. Changed scores were evaluated using paired samples
   t-test.
   Results: Seventy-three graduates (88\%) out of a possible 83 completed
   the pre-and post-program survey. Internal reliability was excellent with
   a Cronbach's alpha of 0.92. Test-retest reliability was stable over time
   (ICC = 0.81). Exploratory factor analysis supported a 1-factor solution
   explaining 58.2\% of variance. Paired samples t-test showed statistical
   significance between the pre- and post-program scores (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: The NUH-ME measure was found to be valid and reliable.
   Confirmatory Factor Analysis of the tool with different groups of
   nursing graduates is required. Mentorship programs can be an effective
   recruitment and retention strategy, but are also resource intensive.
   Measuring new graduates' perceptions of mentoring contributes to program
   relevance in addressing their personal, professional and clinical skill
   development needs. As mentoring engages a diverse range of mentors,
   feedback through measurement may also positively alter organizational
   learning culture.},

Abstract = {Background/Purpose: This aspect of this study examined physical
   education teacher education (PETE) program coordinators' perspectives on
   their role in student recruitment, including common recruitment
   strategies and their effectiveness, perceived barriers to engaging in
   program recruitment, and commonly used marketing strategies. Method:
   Data were collected from 175 PETE program coordinators through the
   online survey described fully in Chapter 4 of this monograph. Data were
   analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation
   coefficients, and one-way analyses of variance. Results: Strategies
   perceived as effective in recruiting high school students were
   moderately associated with those most often implemented (r = .46-.50).
   Some limited differences by Carnegie level were found related to
   reported barriers to participation in recruitment activities.
   Discussion/Conclusion: This study reveals general consistency between
   PETE coordinators' perceptions of the most effective and frequently used
   recruitment strategies to attract students into PETE initial licensure
   programs. Strategies, barriers, and suggested future directions align
   with much of the PETE recruitment literature.},

Title = {An assessment of physician assistant student diversity in the United
   States: a snapshot for the healthcare workforce},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Background: The Physician Assistant (PA) workforce falls short of
   mirroring national demographics mainly due to a lack of diversity in
   student enrollment. Few studies have systematically examined diversity
   across PA programs at the national level, and little is known about best
   practices for consistently graduating a diverse group of students. We
   descriptively characterized the extent to which PA programs are
   graduating a diverse group of students and identified top performing PA
   programs.
   Methods: Data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System
   (IPEDS) were used to calculate the number and proportion of racial or
   ethnically diverse graduates. The study sample included 139 accredited
   PA programs that had graduated a minimum of five cohorts from 2014-2018.
   Within each of the United States Census Divisions, programs were ranked
   according to the number and proportion of graduates who were
   underrepresented minority (URM) race, Hispanic ethnicity, and of
   non-white (URM race, Hispanic, and Asian).
   Results: Amongst PA programs in the United States, a large disparity in
   the number and proportion of racial and ethnic graduates was observed.
   Of 34,625 PA graduates, only 2,207 (6.4\%) were Hispanic ethnicity and
   1,220 (3.5\%) were URM race. Furthermore, a large number of diverse
   graduates came from a small number of top performing programs.
   Conclusion: Despite the abundance of evidence for the need to diversify
   the healthcare workforce, PA programs have had difficulty recruiting and
   graduating a diverse group of students. This study provides empirical
   evidence that PA programs have not been able to attain the level of
   diversity necessary to shift the lack of diversity in the PA workforce.
   Based upon this study's findings, the top performing PA programs can be
   used as role models to establish benchmarks for other programs. The
   results of this descriptive study are currently being used to guide a
   qualitative study to identify the top performers' strategies for
   success.},

Title = {Attitudes and Habits of Highly Humanistic Physicians},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {89},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1252-1258},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Purpose
   Humanism is fundamental to excellent patient care and is therefore an
   essential concept for physicians to teach to learners. However, the
   factors that help attending physicians to maintain their own humanistic
   attitudes over time are not well understood. The authors attempted to
   identify attitudes and habits that highly humanistic physicians perceive
   allow them to sustain their humanistic approach to patient care.
   Method
   In 2011, the authors polled internal medicine residents at the
   University of Pennsylvania to identify attending physicians who
   exemplified humanistic patient care. In this cross-sectional,
   qualitative study, the authors used a semistructured script to interview
   the identified attending physicians to determine attitudes and habits
   that they believed contribute to their sustenance of humanistic patient
   care.
   Results
   Attitudes for sustaining humanism in this cohort of humanistic
   physicians included humility, curiosity, and a desire to live up to a
   standard of behavior. Many of the physicians deliberately worked at
   maintaining their humanistic attitudes. Habits that humanistic
   physicians engaged in to sustain their humanism included
   self-reflection, connecting with patients, teaching and role modeling,
   and achieving work-life balance. Physicians believed that treating their
   patients humanistically serves to prevent burnout in themselves.
   Conclusions
   Identification of factors that highly humanistic attending physicians
   perceive help them to sustain a humanistic outlook over time may inform
   the design of programs to develop and sustain humanism in teaching
   faculty.},

Title = {A Two-Stage Network for Image Deblurring},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {76707-76715},
Abstract = {Blind deblurring is a typical challenge in image processing, carried out
   to correct various complex types of distortions that occur in the real
   world. Although learning-based deblurring methods have substantially
   outperformed the traditional algorithms, they fail to make full use of
   image priors, leading to inconsistent data distributions between the
   restored images and sharp images. In this paper, we divide the
   deblurring process into two steps and propose a two-stage network. The
   first stage generates an initial deblurred image using a common
   convolutional network. The second stage converts the initial data
   distribution into a latent sharp image distribution to obtain sharp
   edges through a prior network. Moreover, we propose a relativistic
   training strategy to train the prior network, which aims to learn the
   latent sharp image priors. In addition, we use a coarse-to-fine
   multiscale framework that shares weights between the different scales.
   The experimental results show that compared with other state-of-the-art
   methods, our method achieves competitive performances on benchmark
   datasets.},

Abstract = {Computing has become essential in modern-day problem-solving, making
   computational literacy necessary for practicing scientists and
   engineers. However, K-12 science education has not reflected this
   computational shift. Integrating computational thinking (CT) into core
   science courses is an avenue that can build computational literacies in
   all students. Integrating CT and science involves using computational
   tools and methods (including programming) to understand scientific
   phenomena and solve science-based problems. Integrating CT and science
   is gaining traction, but widespread implementation is still quite
   limited. Several barriers have limited the integration and
   implementation of CT in K-12 science education. Most teachers lack
   experience with computer science, computing, programming, and CT and
   therefore are ill-prepared to integrate CT into science courses, leading
   to low self-efficacy and low confidence in integrating CT. This
   theoretical paper introduces a novel instructional approach for
   integrating disciplinary science education with CT using unplugged
   (computer-free) activities. We have grounded our approach in common
   computational thinking in STEM frameworks but translate this work into
   an accessible pedagogical strategy. We begin with an overview and
   critique of current approaches that integrate CT and science. Next, we
   introduce the Computational Thinking through Algorithmic Explanations
   (CT-AE) instructional approach. We then explain how CT-AE is informed by
   constructionist writing-to-learn science theory. Based on a pilot
   implementation with student learning outcomes, we discuss connections to
   existing literature and future directions.},

Abstract = {As a promising solution to boost the performance of distance-related
   algorithms (e.g., K-means and KNN), FPGA-based acceleration attracts
   lots of attention, but also comes with numerous challenges. In this
   work, we propose, STPAcc, an optimization framework based on structural
   triangle-inequality (TI)-based pruning (STP) for accelerating
   distance-related algorithms on CPU-FPGA platforms. STPAcc provides a
   domainspecific language to unify distance-related algorithms
   effectively, a structural TI-based pruning strategy to remove
   unnecessary distance computations, a coarse-grained workload
   partitioning and mapping strategy to fully exploit the potentials of the
   CPU-FPGA platform, and fine-grained hardware optimizations to further
   improve performance on the FPGA. Intensive experiments show that STPAcc
   designs achieve 31.42x speedup and 99.63x better energy efficiency on
   average over standard CPU-based implementations.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Abstract = {An optimal robust control solution for general nonlinear systems with
   unknown but observable dynamics is advanced here. The underlying
   Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation of the corresponding zero-sum
   two-player game (ZS-TP-G) is learned using a Q-learning-based approach
   employing only input-output system measurements, assuming system
   observability. An equivalent virtual state-space model is built from the
   system's input-output samples and it is shown that controlling the
   former implies controlling the latter. Since the existence of a
   saddle-point solution to the ZS-TP-G is assumed unverifiable, the
   solution is derived in terms of upper-optimal and lower-optimal
   controllers. The learning convergence is theoretically ensured while
   practical implementation is performed using neural networks that provide
   scalability to the control problem dimension and automatic feature
   selection. The learning strategy is checked on an active suspension
   system, a good candidate for the robust control problem with respect to
   road profile disturbance rejection.},

Title = {Connecting Resident Education to Patient Outcomes: The Evolution of a
   Quality Improvement Curriculum in an Internal Medicine Residency},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},

Volume = {89},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1341-1347},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {As part of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education's
   Next Accreditation System, residency programs must connect
   resident-physician education to improved patient care outcomes.
   Residency training programs, however, face multiple obstacles in doing
   so. Results from residency quality improvement (QI) curricula tend to
   show improvement in simple process-based measures but not in more
   complex outcomes of care such as diabetes or blood pressure control. In
   this article, the authors describe the evolution of their QI educational
   program for internal medicine residents at the University of Cincinnati
   Medical Center within the structure of a novel training model called the
   Ambulatory Long Block. They discuss a resident-run project that led to
   reduced rates of patients with uncontrolled diabetes as an example of
   improvement in outcome measures. Despite favorable results from that
   particular resident group, the successful intervention did not spread
   practice-wide. Using this example, they detail the phases of evolution
   and lessons learned from their curriculum from 2006 to 2014 within a
   framework of previously published general principles for successful QI
   education, including those of exemplary care and learning sites.
   Successful programs require leadership, faculty expertise and
   mentorship, data management, learner buy-in, and patient engagement.
   Their experience will hopefully be of help to others as they attempt to
   simultaneously improve care and education. Further research and
   innovation are needed in this area, including optimizing strategies for
   strengthening resident-driven projects through partnership with nursing,
   allied health, and longitudinally engaged faculty members.},

Title = {Short and Long-Term Impacts of the Cottrell Scholars Collaborative New
   Faculty Workshop},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {92},
Number = {9},

Abstract = {Postsecondary chemistry instructors typically have received little
   pedagogical training as graduate students and postdoctoral research
   assistants. Moreover, professional development opportunities are often
   limited at their own institution. This lack of training has resulted in
   a gap between the instructional strategies enacted in chemistry courses
   and the results of discipline-based education research. Members of the
   Cottrell Scholars Collaborative initiated the New Faculty Workshop (CSC
   NEW) program in 2012 in order to address this gap. This annual, two-day
   workshop provides newly-hired chemistry assistant professors from
   research-intensive universities with training on evidence-based
   instructional practices. This article presents the results of a
   longitudinal, quasi-experimental design study that evaluates the short
   and long-term impacts of the workshop. Online surveys were collected
   immediately before and after the workshop, as well as one year later
   from CSC NEW participants and a control group that consisted of
   newly-hired chemistry faculty who did not participate in the workshop.
   Surveys measured faculty's awareness and use of evidence-based
   instructional practices, teaching self-efficacy, and beliefs about
   teaching. Classroom video recordings were also collected during the fall
   semester following the workshop and two years later. These data were
   triangulated with the Student Evaluation for Educational Quality (SEEQ)
   survey, which was collected from students in the observed classrooms.
   Findings indicate that, in the short-term, the CSC NEW was successful in
   raising workshop participants' self-efficacy, shifting their teaching
   beliefs toward student-centered teaching, and increasing their use of
   interactive teaching. Longitudinal data demonstrate that further
   pedagogical support is required in order for these impacts to be
   sustained.},

   and other factors on professional identity},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {99},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background and objective: Nursing professional identity is an important
   factor in the development of nursing education and clinical practice.
   Career-planning curriculums enable students to learn relevant knowledge
   and skills in a targeted manner, in addition to achieve career targets.
   Assessment and analysis of the present situation of Chinese nursing
   students? career planning and professional identity may provide an
   important guidance for the improvement of teaching content and quality
   of the career-planning curriculum. This study aimed to describe nursing
   students? professional identity, and to find out influences of nursing
   students? career planning, internship experience, and other factors on
   professional identity.
   Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional research method was employed to
   conduct a questionnaire on 453 fulltime junior and senior undergraduate
   nursing students in China in December 2019.
   Results: The average score for nursing students? professional identity
   was 101.42, which is at a moderately lowlevel. There was a significantly
   positive correlation between the level of nursing students? career
   planning and professional identity (r = 0.529, P < 0.01). Nursing
   students? professional identity was also influenced by grade, age,
   acceptance of career-planning curriculums, and other factors.
   Conclusion: The results indicated that the level of professional
   identity in nursing students is closely associated with their career
   planning. One strategy to improve this situation is to motivate
   universities to pay further attention to the effectiveness of
   career-planning curriculums and, to improve the quality of teaching and
   guidance system.},

Title = {Undergraduate nursing students' performance in recognising and
   responding to sudden patient deterioration in high psychological
   fidelity simulated environments: An Australian multi-centre study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},

Abstract = {Background: Early recognition and situation awareness of sudden patient
   deterioration, a timely appropriate clinical response, and teamwork are
   critical to patient outcomes. High fidelity simulated environments
   provide the opportunity for undergraduate nursing students to develop
   and refine recognition and response skills.
   Objectives: This paper reports the quantitative findings of the first
   phase of a larger program of ongoing research: Feedback Incorporating
   Review and Simulation Techniques to Act on Clinical Trends
   (FIRST2ACTTM). It specifically aims to identify the characteristics that
   may predict primary outcome measures of clinical performance, teamwork
   and situation awareness in the management of deteriorating patients.
   Design: Mixed-method multi-centre study.
   Setting: High fidelity simulated acute clinical environment in three
   Australian universities.
   Participants: A convenience sample of 97 final year nursing students
   enrolled in an undergraduate Bachelor of Nursing or combined Bachelor of
   Nursing degree were included in the study.
   Method: In groups of three, participants proceeded through three phases:
   (i) pre-briefing and completion of a multi-choice question test, (ii)
   three video-recorded simulated clinical scenarios where actors
   substituted real patients with deteriorating conditions, and (iii)
   post-scenario debriefing. Clinical performance, teamwork and situation
   awareness were evaluated, using a validated standard checklist (OSCE),
   Team Emergency Assessment Measure (TEAM) score sheet and Situation
   Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT). A Modified Angoff
   technique was used to establish cut points for clinical performance.
   Results: Student teams engaged in 97 simulation experiences across the
   three scenarios and achieved a level of clinical performance consistent
   with the experts' identified pass level point in only 9 (1\%) of the
   simulation experiences. Knowledge was significantly associated with
   overall teamwork (p=.034), overall situation awareness (p=.05) and
   clinical performance in two of the three scenarios (p=.032 cardiac and
   p=.006 shock). Situation awareness scores of scenario team leaders were
   low overall, with an average total score of 41\%.
   Conclusions: Final year undergraduate nursing students may have
   difficulty recognising and responding appropriately to patient
   deterioration. Improving pre-requisite knowledge, rehearsal of first
   response and team management strategies need to be a key component of
   undergraduate nursing students' education and ought to specifically
   address clinical performance, teamwork and situation awareness. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Background: Communication and teamwork between doctors and nurses are
   critical for optimal patient care. Simulation and interprofessional team
   learning are emerging as significant learning strategies to promote
   teamwork and communication between different health professionals.
   Aim: The aim of the study is to describe the development, implementation
   and evaluation of a simulation-based interprofessional educational
   (Sim-IPE) program, using a presage-process-product (3P) model, for
   improving medical and nursing students' communication skills in caring
   of a patient with physiological deterioration.
   Method: The program was conducted using full-scale simulation and
   communication strategies adapted from Team Strategies and Tools to
   Enhance Performance and Patient Safety (TeamSTEPPS). 127 medical and
   nursing students participated in a 3-hour small group interprofessional
   learning that incorporated simulation scenarios of deteriorating
   patients. Pre and post-tests were conducted to assess the students'
   self-confidence in interprofessional communication and perception in
   interprofessional learning. After the training, the students completed
   a,satisfaction questionnaire.
   Results: Both medicine and nursing groups demonstrated a significant
   improvement on post-test score from pretest score for self-confidence (p
   < .0001) and perception (p < .0001) with no significant differences
   detected between the two groups. The participants were highly satisfied
   with their simulation learning.
   Conclusion: The Sim-IPE has better prepared the medical and nursing
   students in communicating with one another in providing safe care for
   deteriorating patient In addition, it has improved their perception
   towards interprofessional learning. This pre-registration
   interprofessional education could prepare them for more comprehensive
   interprofessional team learning at post-registration level. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Despite an estimated population of over 201 million and over 115,950
   yearly diagnosed new cases of cancer, Nigeria does not have dedicated
   medical oncologists. Most oncology care is delivered through surgical
   and clinical oncologists, who are trained in both radiation and medical
   oncology and they number fewer than 50 in the country. With a limited
   number of oncology professionals, cancer patients in Nigeria experience
   poor health outcomes, with an estimated cancer mortality rate of 75,000
   deaths per year. Participants from 15 Nigerian states were selected to
   attend the medical oncology training. Through the support of Fulbright
   Specialist Program and Project PINK BLUE, two of the authors delivered
   10 days of lectures based on ASCO, ESMO, and NCCN guidelines. Mean
   scores of both the pre- and post-course tests as well as a 1-year
   follow-up test were compared using GraphPad Prism 7.0a by paired
   t-tests. Forty-four clinical oncologists were selected for
   participation. Twenty-five (57\%) completed the pre- and post-course
   tests. Of the 25 that completed both tests, percentage of correct
   answers increased from 45 to 59\% (2-sided p-value< 0.0001).
   Improvements were seen in attending doctors 45 to 59\% (p = 0.0046) and
   resident doctors 45 to 59\% (0.0007). Eleven doctors responded to the
   1-year follow-up test. Although not statistically significant, a
   numerical pattern for the benefits was maintained 1 year after the
   program (45\% pre-course versus 52\% post-course correct answers,
   Fisher's exact, p = 0.4185). In the short term, the training improved
   medical oncology knowledge in Nigeria, regardless of the participant's
   carrier stage. Long-term benefits were not sustained in a small sample
   of participants, and continuing education strategies are necessary.
   Similar models may be employed across Africa.},

Title = {`Ward for the day': A case study of extended immersive ward-based
   simulation},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {90},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Simulation is an important teaching strategy in the
   preparation of nursing students for professional practice. The focus of
   simulation has shifted from single patient encounters to multiple case
   studies provoking immersion in all the activities that are regularly
   performed on the ward. Extended immersive simulation cannot replicate
   completely the stresses of working on a `real' ward, but it does provide
   a safe environment for students to practice the role of being a
   registered nurse.
   Objective: To evaluate satisfaction associated with student experiences
   of mentorship by industry partners, self-reflection on performance, and
   responses to clinical situations following an episode of extended
   immersive ward-based simulation.
   Design: Mixed methods case study.
   Setting: School of Nursing and Midwifery metropolitan Western Australian
   university.
   Participants: A cohort of 278 final year students enrolled in a
   three-year Bachelor of Nursing program.
   Method: Eight demonstration rooms were re-configured to resemble a mixed
   medical/surgical ward. Nursing students and manikins in each room
   simulated different patient scenarios. Students were organised in
   three-hour shifts in which to undertake the role of a registered nurse.
   Industry partners undertook shift coordinator and senior nursing roles.
   Surveys were distributed to students at the end of the two-day
   simulation. Student satisfaction was evaluated using the Satisfaction
   with Simulation Experience scale and content analysis of openended
   questions.
   Results: A total of 243 students (87.4\%) responded to the survey. None
   of the scaled items had a mean score of below 4.5. Content analysis of
   458 written responses identified three themes: simulation, role of
   registered nurse and learning.
   Conclusion: Extended immersive ward-based simulation offers the
   opportunity for educators to mirror what happens in clinical practice.
   Students value the opportunity to safely experience simulated demands of
   working on a busy ward and learn how to meet workplace pressures in the
   delivery of patient care.},

Title = {Exploring perceptions and barriers in developing critical thinking and
   clinical reasoning of nursing students: A qualitative study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {95},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Aim: The aims of this study were to explore year two nursing students'
   perceptions toward critical thinking and clinical reasoning and to
   identify the barriers faced by the students in developing critical
   thinking and clinical reasoning.
   Background: Critical thinking and clinical reasoning are core
   competencies emphasized in nursing practices. Nursing students are
   required to develop and practice these skills throughout their nursing
   programs to graduate as competent nurses. However, recent studies still
   report a lack of critical thinking and clinical reasoning in nursing
   students and fresh graduates. Hence, it is important to recognize the
   perceptions of nursing students and the barriers that they face in
   developing critical thinking and clinical reasoning skills.
   Methods: An exploratory descriptive qualitative study design was
   adopted. Twenty nursing students were recruited from a university in
   Singapore. Individual face-to-face interviews, using semi-structured
   questions and an interview guide, were conducted in the academic year
   2018/2019. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.
   Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data.
   Results: Seven themes were emerged, namely: 1) essentials for nursing
   practices, 2) linking theory to practice, 3) individual thought process,
   4) stimulating strategies, 5) classroom environment, 6) clinical
   environment, and 7) students' attributes. Nursing students perceived
   critical thinking and clinical reasoning as essential for nursing
   practices and described these skills as linking theory to practice.
   Strategies such as simulation, case studies, real clinical experiences,
   and guidance from clinical instructors/preceptors were found to
   stimulate critical thinking and clinical reasoning for the students.
   Barriers to developing critical thinking included classroom
   environments, such teaching methods and student-to-tutor ratios, ward
   environments/cultures, and students' attributes/attitudes toward
   learning.
   Conclusion: The findings provided areas for improvement in the current
   nursing education and practices to better support nursing students in
   developing critical thinking and clinical reasoning skills.},

Abstract = {In 2011, the Education in Pediatrics Across the Continuum (EPAC) Study
   Group recruited four medical schools (University of California, San
   Francisco; University of Colorado; University of Minnesota; and
   University of Utah) and their associated pediatrics clerkship and
   residency program directors to be part of a consortium to pilot a model
   designed to advance learners from undergraduate medical education (UME)
   to graduate medical education (GME) and then to fellowship or practice
   based on competence rather than time spent in training. The central
   design features of this pilot included predetermined expectations of
   performance and transition criteria to ensure readiness to progress from
   UME to GME, using the Core Entrustable Professional Activities for
   Entering Residency (Core EPAs) as a common assessment framework. Using
   this framework, each site team (which included, but was not limited to,
   the EPAC course, pediatric clerkship, and pediatric residency program
   directors) monitored learners' progress, with the site's clinical
   competency committee marking the point of readiness to transition from
   UME to GME (i.e., the attainment of supervision level 3a). Two of the
   sites implemented time-variable transition from UME to GME, based on
   when a learner met the performance expectations and transition criteria.
   In this Article, the authors describe each of the four sites'
   implementation of Core EPA assessment and their approach to gathering
   the data necessary to determine readiness for transition. They conclude
   by offering recommendations and lessons learned from the pilot's first
   seven years of development, adaptation, and implementation of assessment
   strategies across the sites, and discussing next steps.},

Abstract = {The landscape of health care delivery and medical education is evolving.
   Institutions must continually reassess priorities, strategies, and
   partnerships to align the knowledge and skills of the health care
   workforce with the delivery of quality, socially accountable,
   collaborative health care that meets the needs of diverse populations in
   communities. This article describes the development, implementation, and
   early outcomes of the University of Missouri-Kansas City's Health Care
   Quality and Patient Safety Consortium. Inspired by an actual patient
   safety event, the consortium aimed to improve patient outcomes by
   establishing quality improvement and patient safety (QIPS) education and
   scholarship as foundational within its unique, horizontal-matrix
   academic health center, which comprises 6 affiliated hospitals and 4
   university-based health sciences schools. The consortium established a
   governance structure with leaders who, collectively, represent the
   diverse members and stakeholders of the consortium. The members share a
   common agenda and mutual goals. The consortium measures success by
   applying published conceptual frameworks for evaluating the outcomes of
   educational programs on learners (Kirkpatrick) and patients (Bzowyckyj
   and colleagues). Consortium learner and patient outcomes span all levels
   of these frameworks. Undergraduate and graduate QIPS-based projects with
   meaningful health system or improved individual health outcomes signify
   a Level 4 outcome (the highest level) for learners and patients alike.
   Factors critical to success include a financial gift, leadership buy-in
   and support, a clear champion, shared goals and a united vision, a
   willingness to collaborate across health systems with varied strengths
   and priorities, and a stable communication platform. Aspirational goals
   of the consortium include increasing involvement across health
   professional schools, incorporating simulation into QIPS activities, and
   aligning the consortium's projects with broader community needs.},

Abstract = {Ultrasound (US) can enhance anatomy education, yet is incorporated into
   few non-medical anatomy programs. This study is the first to evaluate
   the impact of US training in gross anatomy for non-medical students in
   the United States. All 32 master's students enrolled in gross anatomy
   with the anatomy-centered ultrasound (ACUS) curriculum were recruited.
   Mean Likert ratings on pre- and post-course surveys (100\% response
   rates) were compared to evaluate the effectiveness of the ACUS
   curriculum in developing US confidence, and gauge its impact on views of
   US. Post-course, students reported significantly higher (P<0.001) mean
   confidence ratings in five US skills (pre-course versus post-course
   mean): obtaining scans (3.13 +/- 1.04 versus 4.03 +/- 0.78), optimizing
   images (2.78 +/- 1.07 versus 3.75 +/- 0.92), recognizing artifacts (2.94
   +/- 0.95 versus 3.97 +/- 0.69), distinguishing tissue types (2.88 +/-
   0.98 versus 4.09 +/- 0.69), and identifying structures (2.97 +/- 0.86
   versus 4.03 +/- 0.59), demonstrating the success of the ACUS curriculum
   in students with limited prior experience. Views on the value of US to
   anatomy education and to students' future careers remained positive
   after the course. End-of-semester quiz performance (91\% response rate)
   provided data on educational outcomes. The average score was 79\%, with
   a 90\% average on questions about distinguishing tissues/artifacts,
   demonstrating positive learning outcomes and retention. The
   anatomy-centered ultrasound curriculum significantly increased
   confidence with and knowledge of US among non-medical anatomy students
   with limited prior training. Non-medical students greatly value the
   contributions that US makes to anatomy education and to their future
   careers. It is feasible to enhance anatomy education outside of medical
   training by incorporating US. Anat Sci Educ 10: 348-362. (c) 2016

Title = {Computer Digital Technology-Based Educational Platform for Protection
   and Activation Design of Ming Furniture},

Abstract = {Chinese Ming-style furniture is the first of the three major furnitures
   in the world, which has high artistic value and complete structural
   system. The protection of Ming-style furniture and making its design
   show vitality that has always been a research topic in China and even in
   the world. Based on 3D virtual simulation technology, this paper uses 3D
   scanning reverse data acquisition technology and intelligent operation
   of computer engine to realize big data simulation and develops the
   design software of Ming furniture. By means of computer information
   technology, we interpret and present the structural thinking and design
   concept of Ming furniture and transform it into design program software.
   This has formed a system-wide educational software operation platform
   for knowledge reserve, thinking training, design and application, and
   achievement transformation. By applying the mechanism strategy of
   production and teaching to the talent training plan of colleges and
   universities, the underlying logic of talent training, technical
   management, and production management that can open up the innovative
   industry of Ming furniture is also constructed. After experimenting with
   the platform software, students are able to understand the relationship
   between the structure and form of Ming furniture and can design new
   styles that fit the logic of Ming furniture shapes as they prefer.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the decentralized feedback stabilization
   and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP)-based optimization for the class
   of nonlinear systems with matched interconnections. The decentralized
   control law of the overall system is designed by integrating all
   controllers of the isolated subsystems, and it satisfies the optimality
   on the basis of optimal control laws of all the subsystems. For solving
   the optimal control problems of these isolated subsystems, the policy
   iteration algorithm is used to approximately solve the
   Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations in the framework of ADP with the
   neural network implementation, where a set of critic neural networks is
   constructed to estimate the optimal cost functions, and the approximate
   optimal control laws can be obtained after the learning of critic neural
   networks. The weight estimation errors of the critic networks and the
   stability of all isolated subsystems are proved based on the Lyapunov
   theory. Finally, the performance of the proposed decentralized optimal
   control strategy is verified by simulation results.},

Abstract = {In Australia the under-representation of women in computer science
   reflects the under-representation of women at the highest levels of
   government and business. In this paper we argue, therefore, that change
   is going to require a cohesive multi-level analysis and intervention
   approach. To illustrate how such an approach might look, we draw on
   social psychologist Uri Bronfenbrenner's socio-ecological systems theory
   to analyse a national survey with secondary school computer science
   teachers we conducted in 2017. By employing this analysis we can see
   that student interest and engagement in computer science is impacted by
   their teachers, peers and parents (microsystem) who sit within a wider
   community, educational and industry network (mesosystem) which in turn
   is influenced by their access to relevant human and physical
   infrastructure (and the policies that shape it) in their school and
   social environments (exosystem) and by the broader values and rhetoric
   around gender and Digital Technologies in the wider Australian community
   (macrosystem).},

Abstract = {Background: This study examined the influence that perceptions and
   stereotypes of the nursing role had on future career choice of rural
   secondary students.
   Objective: The study was undertaken to identify a method of attracting
   final year secondary school students to an undergraduate nursing degree
   at a rural University.
   Design: A mixed method study using a pre post-interventional design.
   Setting: The rural campus of an Australian university.
   Participants: 71 secondary students attending a secondary school career
   development program at a rural Australian university.
   Method: Semi structured questionnaires were used for data collection.
   The surveys were analysed using descriptive statistics and content
   analysis of open-ended survey questions.
   Results: The research supports the importance of being aware of young
   people's impressions about nurses and nursing as a career, to ensure the
   successful implementation of targeted recruitment.
   Conclusion: Targeted recruitment strategies can increase students'
   awareness of the wide variety of pathways within nursing, rather than
   leaving awareness to what family, friends or career advisers tell them,
   or how nurses are portrayed on television, movies and the media.},

Title = {Chaos Elite Harris Hawk Optimization Algorithm to Solve Chemical Dynamic
   Optimization Problems},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {65833-65853},
Abstract = {Dynamic optimization problems in chemical engineering are often
   described by complex differential equations, In general, Due to the
   complexity of the model established in practice, it is not easy to solve
   it with an accurate algorithm, so the study of numerical methods to
   solve such problems has received much attention. As a new computing
   model, intelligent optimization algorithm has attracted more attention
   in solving dynamic optimization problems because of their easy
   operation. Based on the analysis of the Harris Hawk Optimization
   algorithm, this paper proposes the Chaos Elite Harris Hawk Optimization
   algorithm (CEHHO), which is used to improve the performance of CEHHO
   using control vector parameterization to solve dynamic optimization
   problems of the chemical industry. First of all, when the population is
   initialized, the population is initialized by Opposition-based learning
   Logistic chaos, which improves the diversity of the population and the
   quality of the solution. Second, the linear decreasing escape energy
   factor is changed to a nonlinear decreasing escape energy factor to
   balance the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the algorithm.
   Finally, through the mutation strategy guided by elite individuals, the
   algorithm can jump out of the local optimum. We use 8 test functions and
   5 classical chemical optimization problems to evaluate the feasibility
   of the algorithm and compare and analyze the research results with other
   solving methods, showing the superiority of the CEHHO algorithm.},

Abstract = {Background and Objective: In the last decade, RNA-sequencing technology
   has become method-of-choice and prefered to microarray technology for
   gene expression based classification and differential expression
   analysis since it produces less noisy data. Although there are many
   algorithms proposed for microarray data, the number of available
   algorithms and programs are limited for classification of RNA-sequencing
   data. For this reason, we developed MLSeq, to bring not only frequently
   used classification algorithms but also novel approaches together and
   make them available to be used for classification of RNA sequencing
   data. This package is developed using R language environment and
   distributed through BIOCONDUCTOR network.
   Methods: Classification of RNA-sequencing data is not straightforward
   since raw data should be preprocessed before downstream analysis. With
   MLSeq package, researchers can easily preprocess (normalization,
   filtering, transformation etc.) and classify raw RNA-sequencing data
   using two strategies: (i) to perform algorithms which are directly
   proposed for RNA-sequencing data structure or (ii) to transform
   RNA-sequencing data in order to bring it distributionally closer to
   microarray data structure, and perform algorithms which are developed
   for microarray data. Moreover, we proposed novel algorithms such as voom
   (an acronym for variance modelling at observational level) based nearest
   shrunken centroids (voomNSC), diagonal linear discriminant analysis
   (voomDLDA), etc. through MLSeq.
   Materials: Three real RNA-sequencing datasets (i.e cervical cancer, lung
   cancer and aging datasets) were used to evalute model performances.
   Poisson linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) and negative binomial linear
   discriminant analysis (NBLDA) were selected as algorithms based on
   dicrete distributions, and voomNSC, nearest shrunken centroids (NSC) and
   support vector machines (SVM) were selected as algorithms based on
   continuous distributions for model comparisons. Each algorithm is
   compared using classification accuracies and sparsities on an
   independent test set.
   Results: The algorithms which are based on discrete distributions
   performed better in cervical cancer and aging data with accuracies above
   0.92. In lung cancer data, the most of algorithms performed similar with
   accuracies of 0.88 except that SVM achieved 0.94 of accuracy. Our
   voomNSC algorithm was the most sparse algorithm, and able to select
   2.2\% and 6.6\% of all features for cervical cancer and lung cancer
   datasets respectively. However, in aging data, sparse classifiers were
   not able to select an optimal subset of all features.
   Conclusion: MLSeq is comprehensive and easy-to-use interface for
   classification of gene expression data. It allows researchers perform
   both preprocessing and classification tasks through single platform.
   With this property, MLSeq can be considered as a pipeline for the
   classification of RNA-sequencing data. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The goal of this study was to explore the influencing factors of
   pre-service science teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) for
   targeted aspects of nature of science (NOS) and nature of scientific
   inquiry (NOSI) in a 13-month teacher development program, through
   multiple data sources. The program included a research experience, a
   course on NOS/NOSI, and a teaching practicum. This was an exploratory
   multiple case study of two pre-service science teachers' (Rose and
   Charlie) experiences and development. Data were collected in multiple
   ways including open-ended surveys, interviews, observations, lesson
   plans, reflections, and teaching documents. All data were analyzed in
   three stages for coding, category generation, and emergent themes.
   Throughout the program, the two pre-service teachers improved their
   understanding of NOS/NOSI and successfully enacted their PCK for NOS and
   NOSI into their teaching of middle-level science topics. Rose and
   Charlie used their informed knowledge of the subject matter,
   instructional strategies, assessment, and curriculum towards teaching
   NOS and NOSI to engage students in making predictions, supporting claims
   with evidence, and reflecting on NOS/NOSI aspects relevant to their
   investigations. Some additional factors, such as teacher self-efficacy,
   lesson planning, or general pedagogical knowledge, appeared to impact
   their teaching practicum. This study provides a description of how
   pre-service science teachers can develop PCK for NOS and NOSI over time
   and transfer their understandings to teach NOS and NOSI.},

Abstract = {Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, one of the diagnostic criteria
   of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), greatly hinders children with ASD
   from responding appropriately and adapting themselves in various social
   situations. Although evidences have shown that virtual reality
   environment is a promising tool for emotional and social adaptation
   skills training on ASD population, there is a lack of large-scale trials
   with intensive evaluations to support such findings. This paper presents
   a virtual reality enabled program for enhancing emotional and social
   adaptation skills for children with ASD. Six unique learning scenarios,
   of which one focuses on emotion control and relaxation strategies, four
   that simulate various social situations, and one that facilitates
   consolidation and generalization, are designed and developed with
   corresponding psychoeducation procedures and protocols. The learning
   scenarios are presented to the children via a 4-side immersive virtual
   reality environment (a.k.a., half-CAVE) with non-intrusive motion
   tracking. A total number of 94 children between the ages of 6-12 with
   clinical diagnosis of ASD participated in the 28 session program that
   lasted for 14 weeks. By comparing pre- and post-assessments, results
   reported in this paper show significant improvements in the project's
   primary measures on children's emotion expression and regulation and
   social-emotional reciprocity but not on other secondary measures. (C)

Title = {Closing the Classroom Theory to Practice Gap by Simulating a Psychiatric
   Pharmacy Practice Experience},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {83},
Number = {10},
Pages = {2102-2110},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Objective. To examine the feasibility and effectiveness of combining
   whole-task and guided reflection educational design principles with
   cloud-based learning technologies to simulate the clinical psychiatric
   advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) in the classroom to begin
   to close the theory to practice gap.
   Methods. Components of the typical student experience while completing
   an APPE were integrated into the course experience, ie, patient case
   work-ups, facilitated sessions with a preceptor, personal statement of
   goals and progress with feedback, and intentional interaction with
   peer-learners. Multiple sources of quantitative and qualitative data
   were collected and analyzed.
   Results. Twelve third-year pharmacy students from two campuses
   participated in and successfully completed this one-credit elective
   advanced psychiatric pharmacotherapy course. Eleven board-certified
   psychiatric pharmacists (BCPP) served as visiting experts, some
   participating for multiple weeks, and provided preceptor-like feedback
   to the case presentations in spring 2017. All BCPP pharmacists plus an
   additional geriatric pharmacist specialist participated in the course in
   spring 2018. Results of the quantitative and qualitative analyses
   demonstrated that students progressed in their readiness for APPEs and
   gained additional psychiatric pharmacy knowledge and evidence-based
   medicine decision making skills.
   Conclusion. Pharmacy programs are challenged to find additional ways to
   improve student readiness for APPEs and expand psychiatric learning
   opportunities to meet the increasing mental health needs across clinical
   settings. This example provides a feasible and effective strategy to do
   both without the requirement to create extensive new learning materials
   or add significant faculty workload.},

   Participants: A convenience sample of baccalaureate nursing students in
   the United States.
   Methods: A national sample of 125 undergraduate nursing students
   self-assessed their use of the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of
   scholarly writing over a two-month period. The project also sought to
   determine the association between writing knowledge, skills and
   attitudes and demographic variables of baccalaureate nursing students.
   Results: Participants believe they know the basic components of
   scholarly writing. However, they have difficulty using abstract
   components of writing such as managing the emotional aspect associated
   with writing. Select personal and demographic variables were not
   associated with scholarly writing self-assessment, indicating that other
   factors may influence scholarly writing development.
   Conclusion: Teaching and learning strategies that incorporate the
   knowledge, skills, and attitudes associated with scholarly writing can
   be used to advance current instructional approaches and ultimately,
   better facilitate writing development in baccalaureate nursing students.
   Self-assessments can be used to identify ongoing student development
   needs for scholarly writing and can direct writing instruction.},

Title = {Executive/life coaching for first year medical students: a prospective
   study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {MAY 22},
Abstract = {Background: Student physicians are particularly prone to high rates of
   poor mental and physical quality of life, including depression, anxiety,
   and fatigue. We prospectively tested whether a structured, theory-based
   executive/life coaching program tailored to first year medical students
   in the United States was feasible, tolerable, and would be recommended
   by participants. Secondary goals included impact on coaching goals,
   resilience, and perceived stress.
   Methods: This single-arm intervention study evaluated a program of two
   group and two private coaching sessions during the first year, second
   semester of the Georgetown University School of Medicine Class of 2019.
   Survey data (global and tailored questions, Connor-Davidson resilience
   scale, Friedricksson-Larsson stress question) were collected from
   participants at baseline and post-intervention.
   Results: 37/40 students completed the intervention; 32 completed the
   pre-post surveys. Most (32/37) were willing to recommend the program
   (16/37 were very willing) and 29/37 recommended inclusion in the
   curriculum. Responses to tailored questions showed significant increases
   in self-efficacy regarding stress management (p < 0.001); increased
   awareness of thoughts about stress and management of those thoughts (p =
   0.05). Reported improvements in time management (p = 0.10) and energy
   for relationships and school (p = 0.089) did not achieve significance.
   Global resilience rating was not different (p = 0.186), but significant
   changes were seen in control (p = 0.029) and spiritual influence (p =
   0.005) factors. Although the Friedricksson-Larsson item was not
   significantly different (p = 0.242), 40.6\% of participants reported
   decreased stress and 40.6\% reported unchanged stress during this most
   challenging preclinical semester. Substantial ceiling effects were seen
   in study measures.
   Conclusions: We showed that a tailored executive/life coaching program
   for first year medical students in the United States is feasible,
   tolerable, and safe; adherence was excellent. Global utility ratings and
   willingness to recommend coaching provide substantial support for
   efficacy. Better measures and larger-scale clinical trial designs are
   needed for formal proof.},

Title = {PowerDP: De-Obfuscating and Profiling Malicious PowerShell Commands With
   Multi-Label Classifiers},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {256-270},
Abstract = {In recent years, PowerShell has become the common tool that helps
   attackers launch targeted attacks using living-off-the-land tactics and
   fileless attack techniques. Unfortunately, malware-derived PowerShell
   Commands (PSCmds) have typically been obfuscated to hide the malicious
   intent from detection and analysis. Also, malicious PSCmds' expansive
   use of multiple obfuscation strategies and encryption methods makes them
   difficult to be revealed. Despite the advances in malicious PSCmds
   detection incorporating new approaches such as machine learning and deep
   learning, there is still no consensus on the solution to de-obfuscating
   malicious PSCmds and profiling their behavior. To address this
   challenge, we propose a hybrid framework that combines deep learning and
   program analysis for automatic PowerShell De-obfuscation and behavioral
   Profiling (PowerDP) through multi-label classification in a static
   manner. First, we use character distribution features to forecast
   obfuscation types of malicious PSCmds. Second, we developed an extensive
   de-obfuscator utilizing static regular expression replacement to recover
   the original content of obfuscated PSCmds based on the predicted
   obfuscation types. Finally, we profile the behavior of PSCmds by
   features extracted from the abstract syntax tree of PSCmds after
   de-obfuscation. Our results show that PowerDP achieves a promising
   99.82\% accuracy and 0.18\% hamming loss in obfuscation multi-label
   classification using deep learning. Furthermore, the successful recovery
   rate of the de-obfuscator against 15 obfuscation types is 98.11\% on
   average with semantic similarity comparison, and the accuracy of the
   behavior multi-label classification for identifying 5 behaviors in
   malicious PSCmds averages 98.53\%. The evaluation indicates that PowerDP
   is able to classify and profile complicated PSCmds.},

Title = {Adaptive Online Constructive Fuzzy Tracking Control for Unmanned Surface
   Vessel With Unknown Time-Varying Uncertainties},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {70444-70455},
Abstract = {In this paper, a practical adaptive online constructive fuzzy control
   (AOCFC) algorithm is proposed to handle the trajectory tracking problem
   for the unmanned surface vessel under unknown time-varying
   uncertainties. In the AOCFC algorithm, the dynamic surface control
   technology combined with ``logical virtual vessel'' can program the
   rational reference route while avoiding the problem of ``complexity
   explosion.'' Besides, the proposed online constructive fuzzy
   approximator (OCFA) is devised to deal with the unknown time-varying
   uncertainties. The OCFA has two advantages: first, it can estimate the
   uncertainties without exact information of the dynamic model and
   external environmental disturbances; second, it employs decoupled
   distance measure and structure learning mechanism to dynamically and
   parsimoniously self-constructing fuzzy rules. At the same time, we have
   proved that the tracking errors of the closed-loop control system are
   uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, the simulation result and
   comprehensive comparison demonstrate the proposed controller's
   performance and effectiveness.},

Title = {Online Adaptive Supervised Hashing for Large-Scale Cross-Modal Retrieval},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {206360-206370},
Abstract = {In recent years, with the continuous growth of multimedia data on the
   Internet, multimodal hashing has attracted increasing attention for its
   efficiency in large-scale cross-modal retrieval. Typically, most
   existing multimodal hashing methods are batch-based methods that cannot
   deal with the growing streaming data. Online multimodal hashing adopts
   online learning strategy to learn hash models incrementally, which can
   process large-scale streaming data. However, existing supervised online
   multimodal hashing methods still suffer from several limitations: (1)
   most methods cannot update hash codes of old data when hash model
   changes, which will hinder the retrieval accuracy. (2) the discrete
   optimizations of most methods for learning binary hash codes are less
   efficient or less effective. To address the above limitations, an
   efficient supervised online multimodal hashing method termed Online
   Adaptive Supervised Hashing (OASH) is proposed in this paper. OASH
   regresses class labels and training data to binary hash codes to learn
   discrete hash codes and hash functions with an efficient online
   optimization scheme. It learns hash functions incrementally with newly
   arriving data and updates hash codes with the latest hash model. By
   adaptively updating hash functions and hash codes with new data rather
   than accessing to old data, it gains much performance enhancement and
   computation savings. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets
   validate the superiority of OASH over state-of-the-art methods in both
   accuracy and efficiency.},

Title = {Evaluation of a digital application to support internationally qualified
   nurses' communication and leadership skills},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {104},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Internationally qualified nurses enrolled in Australian
   bridging programs to support professional registration lack confidence,
   and require support and time to develop communication and leadership
   skills in the clinical setting. Strategies that strengthen professional
   self-concept have been demonstrated to improve the nursing performance
   of internationally qualified nurses.
   Objective: To evaluate an interactive mobile application called
   mPreceptor, specifically designed to support internationally qualified
   nurses' communication and leadership skills during a 6 week clinical
   placement. The application facilitated weekly learning content and
   activities in the areas of clinical communication and leadership,
   including self-assessment, goal-setting, case studies, and weekly
   detailed reflections while on placement.
   Design: A quasi-experimental pre and post-test design with a
   non-equivalent comparison group was used to explore the effectiveness of
   mPreceptor on internationally qualified nurses' self-appraisal of
   professional selfconcept, including leadership and communication skills,
   compared with standard clinical placement. The psychometrically tested
   Nurse Self-Concept Questionnaire, measured changes to perceived
   professional self-concept.
   Results: Overall, there was a significant increase in Nurse Self-Concept
   following the clinical placement, confirming that the bridging program
   for internationally qualified nurses in Australia improves leadership
   and communication skills. Leadership skills were significantly greater
   for those internationally qualified nurses who engaged with mPreceptor.
   Conclusion: Further research is required to investigate the application
   of interactive mobile applications, as effective education resources to
   facilitate internationally qualified nurses' transition of skills and
   knowledge to the Australian healthcare context.},

   Assessment},

Abstract = {Teaching residents to practice independently is a core objective of
   graduate medical education (GME). However, billing rules established by
   the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) require that
   teaching physicians physically be present in the examination room for
   the care they bill, unless the training program qualifies for the
   Primary Care Exception Rule (PCER). Teaching physicians in programs that
   use this exception can bill for indirectly supervised ambulatory care
   once the resident who provides that care has completed six months of
   training. However, CMS does not mandate that programs assess or attest
   to residents' clinical competence before using this rule. By requiring
   this six-month probationary period, the implication is that residents
   are adequately prepared for indirectly supervised practice by this time.
   As residents' skill development varies, this may or may not be true. The
   PCER makes no attempt to delineate how residents' competence should be
   assessed, nor does the GME community have a standard for how and when to
   make this assessment specifically for the purpose of determining
   residents' readiness for indirectly supervised primary care practice.
   In this Perspective, the authors review the history and current
   requirements of the PCER, explore its limitations, and offer suggestions
   for how to modify the teaching physician billing requirements to mandate
   the evaluation of residents' competence using the existing milestones
   framework. They also recommend strategies to standardize this process of
   evaluation and to develop benchmarks across training programs.},

Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTING EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In response to the need to broaden participation in computer science, we
   designed a summer camp to teach middle-school-aged youth to code apps
   with MIT App Inventor. For the past four summers, we have observed
   significant gains in youth's interest and self-efficacy in computer
   science, after attending our camps:Me majority of these youth, however,
   were youth from our local community. To provide equal access across the
   state and secure more diversity, we were interested in examining the
   effect of the camp on a broader population of youth. Thus, we partnered
   with an outreach program to reach and test our camps on youth from
   low-income high-poverty areas in the Intermountain West. During the
   summer of 2019, we conducted two sets of camps: locally advertised app
   camps that attracted youth from our local community and a second set of
   camps as part of a larger outreach program for youth from low-income
   high-poverty areas. The camps for both populations followed the same
   design of personnel, camp activities, structure, and curriculum.
   However, the background of the participants was slightly different.
   Using survey data, we found that the local sample experienced
   significant gains in both self-efficacy and interest, while the outreach
   group only reported significant gains in self-efficacy after attending
   the camp. However, the qualitative data collected from the outreach
   participants indicated that they had a positive experience both with the
   camp and their mentors. In this article, we discuss the camp design and
   findings in relation to strategies for broadening participation in
   Computer Science education.},

Abstract = {Hiring new employees is one of the most important and difficult
   decisions all veterinary practice managers and owners face. In an effort
   to improve hiring decisions, many employers are choosing to screen
   potential employees more thoroughly through the use of interviews,
   background checks, personality assessments, and online research
   including social and professional networking websites. The current study
   reports results from an anonymous online survey created to evaluate
   practicing veterinarians' attitudes and practices related to the use of
   recruitment and hiring tools. Results suggest that, compared to those in
   other professions, veterinarians underutilize these evaluative tools.
   The profession could benefit from more opportunities for both
   practitioners and veterinary students to learn how to utilize a broader
   range of hiring and recruitment techniques. One area of particular and
   growing concern is the use of Internet social media for evaluation of
   potential employees. Despite the fairly low number of participants who
   indicated they currently research applicants online, a significant
   number plan to implement this practice in the future. Many students are
   unaware of how their online postings can affect their future job
   possibilities and career. It is therefore important to designate time
   within continuing education programs and professional veterinary
   curricula to educate these populations about hiring and recruitment tool
   options and about how to manage their personal Internet interactions
   (especially social media) to enhance and maintain their professional
   image (e-professionalism).},

Abstract = {This paper demonstrates a stacking sequence optimisation process of a
   composite aircraft wing skin. A two-stage approach is employed to
   satisfy all sizing requirements of this industrial sized, medium
   altitude, long endurance drone. In the first stage of the optimisation,
   generic stacks are used to describe the thickness and stiffness
   properties of the structure while considering both structural
   requirements and discrete guidelines such as blending. In the second
   stage of the optimisation, mathematical programming is used to solve a
   Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation of the stacking sequence
   optimisation. The proposed approach is suitable for real-world thick
   structures comprised of multiple patches. Different thickness
   discretisation strategies are examined for the retrieval of the discrete
   stacking sequences, with each one having a different influence on the
   satisfaction of all structural constraints across the various
   sub-components of the wing. The weight penalty introduced between the
   continuous and final discrete design of the proposed approach is
   negligible.},

Abstract = {Amid calls for graduate medical education (GME) to better prepare a
   workforce that can address growing challenges in health care quality and
   cost, institutions must find ways to more effectively educate and engage
   housestaff in quality improvement (QI) initiatives. Although the
   benefits for trainees and institutions alike can be significant,
   creating and maintaining successful strategies has proven challenging.
   Multiple barriers (e.g., variable backgrounds and needs of trainees)
   have clouded the educational and clinical effectiveness of many efforts.
   Recent findings suggest that trainee engagement in QI is lacking and
   that contextual support for practice-based learning and systems-based
   practice is often suboptimal.
   Meaningful GME reform must include changes in how institutions approach
   QI education, particularly in how they create appropriate learning
   environments for trainees. Institutions can achieve these goals and
   foster a positive QI culture by aligning housestaff QI teaching with
   institutional priorities in several ways. First, they can create common,
   institutional-level QI curricula to standardize expectations for
   learners across training levels and specialties. Second, they can engage
   housestaff in ongoing institutional QI efforts by encouraging these
   trainees to develop and execute QI projects or assemble QI-focused
   groups that include faculty and institutional leaders. Third,
   institutions can appoint housestaff to institutional QI committees and
   have housestaff groups review and endorse proposed QI initiatives to
   enhance operational decision making. Institutions can leverage the new
   Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Clinical Learning
   Environment Review program to implement these strategies, measure
   progress, and realize important gains in housestaff QI education.},

Abstract = {We present an interactive discovery-based approach to studying the
   properties of real gases using simple, yet realistic, molecular dynamics
   software. Use of this approach opens up a variety of opportunities for
   students to interact with the behaviors and underlying theories of real
   gases. Students can visualize gas behavior under a variety of
   conditions; they can implement kinetic theory expressions as computer
   code to compute macroscopic quantities from microscopic/kinematic
   behaviors of the simulated gases, and they can explore strategies to
   quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate deviations from ideal gas
   behavior. A simple and fully functional molecular dynamics program
   written in the C programming language that has been tested on Windows,
   Mac, and Linux platforms accompanies this article; detailed suggestions
   are provided for implementing this exercise with or without programming
   activities.},

Title = {Using Bayesian networks for selecting classifiers in GP ensembles},
Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {258},
Pages = {200-216},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Ensemble techniques have been widely used to improve classification
   performance also in the case of GP-based systems. These techniques
   should improve classification accuracy by using voting strategies to
   combine the responses of different classifiers. However, even reducing
   the number of classifiers composing the ensemble, by selecting only
   those appropriately ``diverse{''} according to a given measure, gives no
   guarantee of obtaining significant improvements in both classification
   accuracy and generalization capacity. This paper presents a novel
   approach for combining GP-based ensembles by means of a Bayesian
   Network. The proposed system is able to learn and combine decision tree
   ensembles effectively by using two different strategies: in the first,
   decision tree ensembles are learned by means of a boosted GP algorithm;
   in the second, the responses of the ensemble are combined using a
   Bayesian network, which also implements a selection strategy to reduce
   the number of classifiers. Experiments on several data sets show that
   the approach obtains comparable or better accuracy with respect to other
   methods proposed in the literature, considerably reducing the number of
   classifiers used. In addition, a comparison with similar approaches,
   confirmed the goodness of our method and its superiority with respect to
   other selection techniques based on diversity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {Introduction: Ensuring knowledgeable, skilled HIV providers is
   challenged by rapid advances in the field, diversity of patients and
   providers, and the need to retain experienced providers while training
   new providers. These challenges highlight the need for education
   strategies, including training and clinical consultation to support
   translation of new knowledge to practice. New England AIDS Education and
   Training Center (NEAETC) provides a range of educational modalities
   including academic peer detailing and distance support to HIV providers
   in six states. We describe the interprofessional perspectives of HIV
   providers who participated in this regional program to understand
   success and areas for strengthening pedagogical modality, content, and
   impact on clinical practice.
   Methods: This 2013 to 2014 mixed-methods study analyzed quantitative
   programmatic data to understand changes in training participants and
   modalities and used semistructured interviews with 30 HIV providers and
   coded for preidentified and emerging themes.
   Results: Since 2010, NEAETC evolved modalities to a greater focus on
   active learning (case discussion, clinical consultation), decreasing
   didactic training by half (18-9\%). This shift was designed to move from
   knowledge transfer to translation, and qualitative findings supported
   the value of active learning approaches. Providers valued interactive
   trainings and presentation of cases supporting knowledge translation.
   On-site training encouraged peer networking and sharing of lessons
   learned. Diversity in learning priorities across providers and sites
   validated NEAETC's approach of tailoring topics to local needs and
   encouraging regional networking.
   Discussion: Tailored approaches resulted in improved provider-reported
   capacity, peer learning, and support. Future evaluations should explore
   the impact of this multipronged approach on supporting a community of
   practice and empowerment of provider teams.},

Title = {S-TEAMS: A Truly Multiprofessional Course Focusing on Nontechnical
   Skills to Improve Patient Safety in the Operating Theater},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {74},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Possessing adequate nontechnical skills (NTS) in operating
   theaters is of increasing interest to health care professionals, yet
   these are rarely formally taught. Teams make human errors despite
   technical expertise and knowledge, compromising patient safety. We
   designed a 1-day, multiprofessional, multidisciplinary course to teach,
   practice, and apply these skills through simulation.
   METHODS: The course, ``S-TEAMS,{''} comprised a morning of lectures,
   case studies, and interactive teamworking exercises. The afternoon
   divided the group into multiprofessional teams to rotate around
   simulated scenarios. During the scenarios, teams were encouraged to
   focus on NTS, including communication strategies, situational awareness,
   and prompts such as checklists. A thorough debrief with experienced
   clinician observers followed. Data was collected through
   self-assessments, immediate and 6-month feedback to assess whether
   skills continued to be used and their effect on safety.
   FINDINGS: In total, 68 health care professionals have completed the
   course thus far. All participants felt the course had a clear structure
   and that learning objectives were explicit. Overall, 95\% felt the
   scenarios had good or excellent relevance to clinical practice.
   Self-assessments revealed a 55\% increase in confidence for ``speaking
   up{''} in difficult situations. Long-term data revealed 97\% of the
   participants continued to use the skills, with 88\% feeling the course
   had prevented them from making errors. Moreover, 94\% felt the course
   had directly improved patient safety.
   CONCLUSIONS: There is a real demand and enthusiasm for developing NTS
   within the modern theater team. The simple and easily reproducible
   format of S-TEAMS is sustainable and inclusive, and crucially, the
   skills taught continue to be used in long term to improve patient safety
   and teamworking. ((C) 2016 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

Abstract = {A recent call to address health care disparities has come from the
   Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education's (ACGME's)
   Clinical Learning Environment Review (CLER) program. The CLER program
   aspires that faculty and residents will identify the disparities among
   the patient populations they serve and engage in quality improvement
   (QI) activities designed to address them. In this Perspective, the
   authors provide a framework for integrating QI and health equity
   principles in graduate medical education to meet these ACGME
   expectations. The authors illustrate their four-step framework by
   describing a faculty development workshop that provides strategies and
   tools for embedding equity into existing QI educational efforts and
   using QI methods to address equity challenges. Using examples, the
   authors outline how medical educators can begin to integrate QI and
   equity initiatives to address health care disparities and involve their
   residents/fellows in the process. In addition, the authors emphasize the
   importance of applying an equity lens to QI interventions and of
   recognizing that QI initiatives will have different impacts on outcomes
   depending on the patient population. The authors conclude by discussing
   the need for institutional leadership to build capacity and training to
   improve data collection and reporting of quality metrics by demographic
   variables; provide resources to disseminate lessons learned; support
   faculty development to teach and mentor trainees through equity-related
   QI work; and prioritize time in the curriculum for learners to
   participate in equity improvement activities.},

Title = {Challenges and Opportunities in Game Artificial Intelligence Education
   Using Angry Birds},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Pages = {793-804},
Abstract = {Games have been an important tool for motivating undergraduate students
   majoring in computer science and engineering. However, it is difficult
   to build an entire game for education from scratch, because the task
   requires high-level programming skills and expertise to understand the
   graphics and physics. Recently, there have been many different game
   artificial intelligence (AI) competitions, ranging from board games to
   the state-of-the-art video games (car racing, mobile games,first-person
   shooting games, real-time strategy games, and so on). The competitions
   have been designed such that participants develop their own AI module on
   top of public/commercial games. Because the materials are open to the
   public, it is quite useful to adopt them for an undergraduate course
   project. In this paper, we report our experiences using the Angry Birds
   AI Competition for such a project-based course. In the course, teams of
   students consider computer vision, strategic decision-making, resource
   management, and bug-free coding for their outcome. To promote
   understanding of game contents generation and extensive testing on the
   generalization abilities of the student's AI program, we developed
   software to help them create user-created levels. Students actively
   participated in the project and the final outcome was comparable with
   that of successful entries in the 2013 International Angry Birds AI
   Competition. Furthermore, it leads to the development of a new
   parallelized Angry Birds AI Competition platform with undergraduate
   students aiming to use advanced optimization algorithms for their
   controllers.},

Abstract = {The preceding chapters of this monograph have served to situate the
   study of physical education teacher education recruitment and retention
   within relevant literature and theory. This chapter outlines the
   sequential explanatory design methods, whereby participants in an online
   survey were selected using stratified random sampling to participate in
   follow-up interviews. The chapter opens with an overview of participant
   identification and recruitment. Participants were program coordinators
   drawn from a database that included contact information for physical
   education teacher education faculty members working at colleges and
   universities across the United States. Next, the participants in the
   quantitative and qualitative elements of the study are described, with
   attention to both individual and institutional factors. Survey design
   and content validity are discussed, as well as the development of a
   qualitative interview guide. The chapter concludes with a discussion of
   quantitative and qualitative data analysis strategies used to support
   the results presented in the subsequent chapters.},

Title = {Hierarchical Multi-agent Model for Reinforced Medical Resource
   Allocation with Imperfect Information},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, the shortage in medical
   resources became increasingly more evident. Therefore, efficient
   strategies for medical resource allocation are urgently needed. However,
   conventional rule-based methods employed by public health experts have
   limited capability in dealing with the complex and dynamic
   pandemic-spreading situation. In addition, model-based optimization
   methods such as dynamic programming (DP) fail to work since we cannot
   obtain a precise model in real-world situations most of the time.
   Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful tool for
   decision-making; however, three key challenges exist in solving this
   problem via RL: (1) complex situations and countless choices for
   decision-making in the real world; (2) imperfect information due to the
   latency of pandemic spreading; and (3) limitations on conducting
   experiments in the real world since we cannot set up pandemic outbreaks
   arbitrarily. In this article, we propose a hierarchical RL framework
   with several specially designed components. We design a decomposed
   action space with a corresponding training algorithm to deal with the
   countless choices, ensuring efficient and real-time strategies. We
   design a recurrent neural network-based framework to utilize the
   imperfect information obtained from the environment. We also design a
   multi-agent voting method, which modifies the decision-making process
   considering the randomness during model training and, thus, improves the
   performance. We build a pandemic-spreading simulator based on real-world
   data, serving as the experimental platform. We then conduct extensive
   experiments. The results show that our method outperforms all baselines,
   which reduces infections and deaths by 14.25\% on average without the
   multi-agent voting method and up to 15.44\% with it.},

Abstract = {With the industrialization of modern society, the pollution of water
   resources becomes more and more serious. Although purifying urban sewage
   through the wastewater treatment plants eases the burden of fragile
   ecosystems, the nonlinearities and uncertainties of biochemical
   reactions are difficult to address. In this article, a dynamic
   prioritized policy gradient adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) method is
   developed to solve the optimal control problem of nonaffine nonlinear
   discrete-time systems, along with convergence analysis of the algorithm.
   To the best of our knowledge, it is indispensable to conduct system
   modeling during the previous ADP research on wastewater treatment
   process control. By introducing the dynamic prioritized replay buffer
   and neural networks, the proposed ADP controller can track the setpoints
   of the wastewater treatment plant and alleviate the effects of
   disturbance without system modeling. The test results verify that the
   devised control method outperforms the proportional-integral-derivative
   strategy with less oscillation when unknown interference occurred.},

Title = {Critical features of peer assessment of clinical performance to enhance
   adherence to a low back pain guideline for physical therapists: a mixed
   methods design},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Month = {NOV 12},
Abstract = {Background: Clinical practice guidelines are intended to improve the
   process and outcomes of patient care. However, their implementation
   remains a challenge. We designed an implementation strategy, based on
   peer assessment (PA) focusing on barriers to change in physical therapy
   care. A previously published randomized controlled trial showed that PA
   was more effective than the usual strategy ``case discussion{''} in
   improving adherence to a low back pain guideline. Peer assessment aims
   to enhance knowledge, communication, and hands-on clinical skills
   consistent with guideline recommendations. Participants observed and
   evaluated clinical performance on the spot in a role-play simulating
   clinical practice. Participants performed three roles: physical
   therapist, assessor, and patient. This study explored the critical
   features of the PA program that contributed to improved guideline
   adherence in the perception of participants.
   Methods: Dutch physical therapists working in primary care (n = 49)
   organized in communities of practice (n = 6) participated in the PA
   program. By unpacking the program we identified three main tasks and
   eleven subtasks. After the program was finished, a questionnaire was
   administered in which participants were asked to rank the program tasks
   from high to low learning value and to describe their impact on
   performance improvement. Overall ranking results were calculated.
   Additional semi-structured interviews were conducted to elaborate on the
   questionnaires results and were transcribed verbatim. Questionnaires
   comments and interview transcripts were analyzed using template
   analysis.
   Results: Program tasks related to performance in the therapist role were
   perceived to have the highest impact on learning, although task
   perceptions varied from challenging to threatening. Perceptions were
   affected by the role-play format and the time schedule. Learning
   outcomes were awareness of performance, improved attitudes towards the
   guideline, and increased self-efficacy beliefs in managing patients with
   low back pain. Learning was facilitated by psychological safety and the
   quality of feedback.
   Conclusion: The effectiveness of PA can be attributed to the structured
   and performance-based design of the program. Participants showed a
   strong cognitive and emotional commitment to performing the physical
   therapist role. That might have contributed to an increased awareness of
   strength and weakness in clinical performance and a motivation to change
   routine practice.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The experience in the operating room is considered as a
   crucial element affecting medical students' satisfaction with
   workplace-based training in surgery. We developed the ``Students'
   Perception of the Operating Room Educational Environment Measure{''}
   (SPOREEM) and applied the approach of Item Response Theory to improve
   accuracy of its measurement.
   DESIGN: Psychometric analysis determined the factorial structure. Using
   Item Response Theory, item thresholds were calculated on response option
   levels. Sum scores in the factors were then computed using calibrated
   unit weights.
   SETTING: One hundred medical students from the University Medical Center
   in Goettingen, Germany, enrolled in a one-week surgery rotation
   completed the SPOREEM.
   RESULTS: The final 19-item questionnaire resulted in 3 factors:
   ``Learning support and inclusion{''} (1), ``Workplace atmosphere{''}
   (2), and ``Experience of emotional stress{''} (3). Item calibration
   resulted in refinement of sum scores in the factors. Male students
   significantly rated factor 1 more positively. Factor 2 was perceived to
   a similar degree in all 3 surgical disciplines involved. Factor 3 was
   rated lower by those students planning a surgical field of postgraduate
   training.
   CONCLUSIONS: We developed a valid, reliable, and feasible tool to assess
   the overall educational climate of undergraduate training in the OR.
   Calibration of items refined the measurement. (C) 2020 Association of

Abstract = {Recently various embedded methods for unsupervised feature selection
   have been put forward. However, most of them adopt a two-step strategy,
   i.e., selecting k top-ranked dimensions according to a learned order of
   all features, then conducting K-means clustering for evaluation. This
   commonly used strategy usually results in a group of sub-optimal
   features, because the selected k top ranked features are seldom the
   desired top-k dimensions. To address this problem, we rethink the two
   steps in a joint manner and propose a simple yet effective approach
   called Unsupervised Feature Selection with Separability (UFS2) to
   simultaneously select features and cluster data. More specifically, a
   binary vector is seamlessly integrated into K-means to select an exact
   number of features for clustering. Different from previous embedded
   methods involving l(2,1)-norm, our joint model explicitly uses the
   parameter k (i.e., the number of selected features). Afterwards, a
   customized term for the binary vector is designed to maximize the
   separability among selected feature dimensions. In order to solve the
   formulated 0-1 integer programming problem, an iterative algorithm is
   developed. Finally, we evaluate the proposed approach extensively on
   different datasets. Despite the relative simplicity, UFS2 remarkably and
   generally outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.},

Title = {Closing the Gap: Evaluation of Gender Disparities in Urology Resident
   Operative Autonomy and Performance},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Gender disparities have demonstrated influence on several
   areas of medical trainee academic performance and surgeon professional
   attainment. The impact of gender on perceived operative autonomy and
   performance of urology residents is not well understood. This
   single-institution pilot study explores this relationship by evaluating
   urology faculty and resident assessment of resident operative autonomy
   and performance using the Society for Improving Medical Professional
   Learning app.
   DESIGN: Using Society for Improving Medical Professional Learning,
   trainees in a single urology residency program were assessed in
   operative cases on three scales (autonomy, performance, and case
   complexity). Intraoperative assessments were completed by both faculty
   and residents (self-evaluation). Respective evaluations were compared to
   explore differences in ratings by gender.
   SETTING: University of Michigan Health, Ann Arbor, MI.
   PARTICIPANTS: University of Michigan Urology Residents and Faculty.
   RESULTS: A total of 516 evaluations were submitted from 18 urology
   residents and 20 urology faculty. Self reported ratings among female and
   male residents did not differ significantly for autonomy (p = 0.20) or
   performance (p = 0.82). Female and male residents received overall
   similar autonomy ratings that were not significantly different from
   female faculty (p = 0.66) and male faculty (p = 0.81). For female
   residents, there was no significant difference in performance ratings by
   faculty gender (p = 0.20). This finding was consistent when the resident
   was male (p = 0.70).
   CONCLUSIONS: At our institution, there is no overall gender-based
   difference in self-rated or faculty-rated operative autonomy or
   performance among urology trainees. Understanding relevant facets of
   institutional culture as well as educational strategies between faculty
   and residents may identify factors contributing to this outcome. ((C)

Abstract = {Background Educational robotics (ER) is increasingly used in classrooms
   to implement activities aimed at fostering the development of students'
   computational thinking (CT) skills. Though previous works have proposed
   different models and frameworks to describe the underlying concepts of
   CT, very few have discussed how ER activities should be implemented in
   classrooms to effectively foster CT skill development. Particularly,
   there is a lack of operational frameworks, supporting teachers in the
   design, implementation, and assessment of ER activities aimed at CT
   skill development. The current study therefore presents a model that
   allows teachers to identify relevant CT concepts for different phases of
   ER activities and aims at helping them to appropriately plan
   instructional interventions. As an experimental validation, the proposed
   model was used to design and analyze an ER activity aimed at overcoming
   a problem that is often observed in classrooms: the trial-and-error
   loop, i.e., an over-investment in programming with respect to other
   tasks related to problem-solving. Results Two groups of primary school
   students participated in an ER activity using the educational robot
   Thymio. While one group completed the task without any imposed
   constraints, the other was subjected to an instructional intervention
   developed based on the proposed model. The results suggest that (i) a
   non-instructional approach for educational robotics activities (i.e.,
   unlimited access to the programming interface) promotes a
   trial-and-error behavior; (ii) a scheduled blocking of the programming
   interface fosters cognitive processes related to problem understanding,
   idea generation, and solution formulation; (iii) progressively adjusting
   the blocking of the programming interface can help students in building
   a well-settled strategy to approach educational robotics problems and
   may represent an effective way to provide scaffolding. Conclusions The
   findings of this study provide initial evidence on the need for specific
   instructional interventions on ER activities, illustrating how teachers
   could use the proposed model to design ER activities aimed at CT skill
   development. However, future work should investigate whether teachers
   can effectively take advantage of the model for their teaching
   activities. Moreover, other intervention hypotheses have to be explored
   and tested in order to demonstrate a broader validity of the model.},

Abstract = {Background Occupational and physical therapy academic programs are
   rigorous. Increased rates of student anxiety and depression may impact
   learning. Data on student study skills, self-efficacy, and mental health
   is limited. This study explored relationships between students'
   self-efficacy, mental health factors, and approaches to studying. Method
   A cross-sectional study was designed. Seventy-three students completed
   the Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students-Short Form,
   General Self-Efficacy Scale, and Mental Health Continuum-Short Form.
   Associations between predictors (education program, general
   self-efficacy and mental health) and ratings on the study approach
   scales were analyzed with multiple linear regression. Results Multiple
   regression models revealed associations between higher self-efficacy and
   higher ratings on the deep (beta = 0.49, p < 0.01) and strategic (beta =
   0.34, p < 0.05) scales, and lower ratings on the surface scale (beta = -
   0.29, p < 0.01). Compared to OT students, PT students had higher surface
   approach ratings (beta = - 0.36, p < 0.001). Poorer mental health scores
   were associated with higher surface approach ratings (beta = - 0.41, p <
   0.001). Conclusions To support productive study strategies among
   occupational and physical therapy students it may be useful to promote
   their general self-efficacy and positive mental health.},

Abstract = {Background: The nursing faculty shortage affects the number of nurse
   graduates. Understanding the meaning of being a nurse educator and what
   attracts nurses with graduate degrees to academia, are important
   considerations in addressing the recruitment and retention of faculty.
   Aim: The aim of this study was to explore the meaning of being a nurse
   educator and how nurse educators' understand their attraction to
   academia.
   Design and Participants: The sample population included 15 nurse
   educators with a master's or doctoral degree, currently teaching in an
   undergraduate or graduate nursing program in a western Canadian city.
   Method: Data were collected through 15 face-to-face semi-structured
   interviews using an interview guide.
   Findings: The meaning of being a nurse educator and how nurse educators
   understand their attraction to academia illustrates, from the
   perspective of the participants, how they give meaning to being a nurse
   educator and how they understand their attraction to academia. Six
   subthemes emerged: (1) opportunities, (2) wanting to teach, (3) seeing
   students learn, (4) contributing to the profession, (5) the
   unattractive, and (6) flexibility.
   Conclusion: The faculty shortage is a complex issue, one that will
   persist into the foreseeable future. Understanding how nurse educators
   experience academia and how the meaning of these experiences attract
   them to academia, will facilitate the development of creative strategies
   to recruit and retain qualified nurse educators. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Multi-Center Brain Imaging Classification Using a Novel 3D CNN Approach},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {49925-49934},
Abstract = {With the development of brain imaging technology, increasing amounts of
   magnetic resonance imaging data are being acquired, and traditional
   computational analysis methods based on single sites and small samples
   are facing substantial challenges. Deep learning technology, which is
   born via artificial intelligence, has shown the powerful ability to
   solve the classification problem based on big data in many studies,
   while it has not been widely used in brain imaging classification.
   Herein, we utilized our proposed novel 3-D deep adding neural network to
   classify 6008 samples from the largest data sets in the brain imaging
   field collected from more than 61 centers. The proposed method utilizes
   multiple convolutional layers to extract gradient information in
   different orientations and combines spatial information at two scales
   via the adding operation. High accuracy (over 92.5\%) was obtained with
   a standard fivefold cross-validation strategy, demonstrating that the
   proposed method can effectively handle big data classifications from
   multiple centers. Compared with some traditional classification methods
   and some deep learning architectures, the proposed method was more
   accurate, demonstrating its stronger power to classify data from
   multiple centers. Our cross-site classification results prove that the
   proposed method is robust when training on a data set and testing on
   another data set. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first
   to classify neuroimaging data on such a large scale from multiple
   centers with such high accuracy. With its improved performance in
   classification and transferable program codes, the proposed method can
   potentially be used in intelligent medical treatment strategies and
   clinical practices based on mobile terminal.},

Title = {Cultural competence education for health professionals from
   pre-graduation to licensure delivered using facebook: Twelve-month
   follow-up on a randomized control trial},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},

Abstract = {Background: Cultural competence (CC) training is widely recognized as a
   crucial component of the professional development of healthcare
   providers. There is no study on the effect of Facebook (FB) as a
   strategy to promote continual learning to enhance CC among students in
   health professions.
   Objectives: To test the effects of cultural competence education using
   FB as a delivery platform on knowledge, awareness, self-efficacy, and
   skill related to CC in health students from pre-graduation to licensed
   professional stages.
   Design: A randomized controlled trial.
   Participants: We recruited students from professional nursing, pharmacy,
   and nutrition programs at six medical universities and randomly assigned
   them to study groups.
   Methods: Between T1 and T2 (months 1-3), the intervention group (IG)
   received pre-graduation education in CC while the control group (CG)
   received their regular educational program. Between T2 and T3 (months
   6-9), IG received on-the-job education in CC while CG received the
   regular program. An online self-report questionnaire assessing CC
   knowledge, awareness, self-efficacy, and skill was analyzed at baseline,
   6 months, and 12 months.
   Results: Of 180 participants who completed the pretest, 120 (65 IG and
   55 CG) completed both follow-ups. Changes over time were mixed; the only
   statistical difference between groups was an improvement in awareness in
   IG but not in CG. At 12 months, intervention and control participants
   had different levels of awareness of CC (beta = 2.56, p < 0.001), but
   other outcomes did not differ between groups.
   Conclusion: Health profession educators can adopt Facebook as an
   education delivery platform to offer personalized, social learning
   incorporating cultural competency curricula into ongoing education and
   training in rising awareness on CC.},

   Optimization},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {129738-129753},
Abstract = {This paper develops a robust chance-constrained model for handling the
   uncertainties of generation and consumption in multi-carrier energy
   hubs. The proposed model incorporates corresponding loading factors for
   each type of electrical, heating, and cooling loads. This is done to
   assess the maximum loadability of the whole system. In this respect, the
   chance-constrained approach is implemented for the feasibility
   assessment of the operation problem with uncertainties. The
   uncertainties which are assumed here include the forecast errors of
   electrical, heating, and cooling load demands, and the volatile solar
   power generation. The overall problem formulation is developed in the
   mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework. The standard
   chance-constrained approach is converted to a deterministic optimization
   model by utilizing the Big M method. The main objective of the proposed
   model is to maximize the loadability index with uncertainties while
   addressing the permissible risk index of the decision-maker. The studied
   energy hub comprises electrical, heating, and cooling loads, and the
   energy flow technique is adopted in this paper to model the load balance
   equations. The simulation results are presented for different scenarios
   while addressing features of the proposed model for the summer and
   winter seasons. Furthermore, the developed model is evaluated for
   different scenarios and a comparison is made with the information-gap
   decision theory (IGDT) method.},

Abstract = {In this paper we present the main lines of a course on the history of
   mathematics for prospective secondary school (students' age range 14-19)
   mathematics teachers, enrolled on a 2-year postgraduate teacher
   preparation program. In order to integrate the historical objectives
   with the educational objectives of the program we adopted the following
   strategy: on the one hand we focused on some important concepts taught
   in upper secondary school that required the prospective teachers to
   reflect on the difficulties linked to these concepts; on the other hand
   we proposed original sources intended to enhance the students'
   reflection through challenging some existing beliefs on these concepts.
   We informed the prospective teachers that they were participating in a
   research project. This fostered a collaborative atmosphere and an active
   involvement that guided our students towards the final step of the
   course, where they were requested to outline a teaching sequence for
   presenting the concepts in the classroom.},

Abstract = {Achieving the United Nations sustainable development goals requires
   industry and society to develop tools and processes that work at all
   scales, enabling goods delivery, services, and technology to large
   conglomerates and remote regions. Process Intensification (PI) is a
   technological advance that promises to deliver means to reach these
   goals, but higher education has yet to totally embrace the program.
   Here, we present practical examples on how to better teach the
   principles of PI in the context of the Bloom's taxonomy and summarise
   the current industrial use and the future demands for PI, as a
   continuation of the topics discussed in Part 1. In the appendices, we
   provide details on the existing PI courses around the world, as well as
   teaching activities that are showcased during these courses to aid
   students' lifelong learning. The increasing number of successful
   commercial cases of PI highlight the importance of PI education for both
   students in academia and industrial staff. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Abstract = {A lack of diversity in the clinical cancer workforce causes undue burden
   limiting research and patient care advancements. Recruitment and
   retention of individuals underrepresented in medicine/research can
   enhance patient-provider concordance. The Student-centered Pipeline to
   Advance Research in Cancer Careers (SPARCC) uniquely prepares
   underrepresented minority students to quickly transition into the
   clinical research workforce and seek advanced graduate degrees.
   Experiential learning theory and culturally responsive pedagogy ground
   SPARCC's rigorous competency-based curriculum incorporating cancer care,
   clinical trial development, social supports, and mentored research
   experiences. Concurrent mixed-methods analysis includes evaluations of
   workshops, clinical-practicums, and pre-, post-, and
   6-month-post-knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Analysis of data
   included stepwise multivariate regression analysis, Spearman's rho
   correlations, and assessments of inter-item reliability via Cronbach's
   alpha (IBM (R) SPSS (R) 24.0). Inductive content analysis coded phrases
   and analytic patterns were distilled enhancing descriptions of
   experiences. From January 2019 to March 2019, 62\% of applications came
   from underrepresented minorities. Ten students were accepted, 90\%
   identified as underrepresented minority. All ten students completed the
   pre-, post-, and 6-month-post-evaluations. Overall scores increased
   significantly from pre-evaluation to 6-month-post-evaluation. Evaluation
   data came from 431 responses of 60 workshops, with a mean score of 9.1
   (10-point scale). Students completed three clinical practicums, which
   received an overall mean score of 8.2 (10-point scale). A robust
   curriculum, structured recruitment, diverse faculty, and comprehensive
   evaluations made SPARCC a compelling strategy for supporting
   underrepresented minority students to seek immediate employment as
   clinical research professionals or application to advanced graduate
   degree programs.},

Title = {Active Block Diagonal Subspace Clustering},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {83976-83992},
Abstract = {Subspace clustering aims to find clusters in the low-dimensional
   subspaces for high-dimensional data. Subspace clustering with Block
   Diagonal Representation (BDR) maintains the number of connected
   components of the graph by Laplacian rank constraint, and the learned
   affinity matrix shows a block diagonal structure, which will achieve a
   good segmentation for the dataset by spectral clustering. However, the
   subspaces of real data may overlap and the learned affinity matrix may
   be imprecise. In this work, we propose an Active learning framework for
   BDR(ABDR) to acquire and incorporate prior knowledge to improve the
   subspace clustering performance. An active selection strategy is
   designed to acquire labels of the informative data points from both the
   skeleton of clusters and the boundaries of clusters, and then the
   labeled data are converted into pairwise constraints, which are
   incorporated into BDR. The optimization of the new objective function is
   given and the convergence of ABDR is discussed. Experimental results on
   three images datasets(MNIST, ORL and COIL-20) and one UCI
   dataset(ISOLET) demonstrate the effectiveness of ABDR on complex
   clustering tasks and show that ABDR is superior to multiple
   state-of-the-art active clustering and learning techniques.},

   Professional Identities to Meet Overlapping Demands at Work},

Abstract = {Phenomenon Clinical teachers perform overlapping tasks in education and
   patient care. They are therefore expected to juggle many professional
   identities such as educator and clinician. Yet little is known about how
   clinical teachers negotiate their professional identities. The present
   research examined the lived experiences of clinical teachers as they
   manage and make sense of their professional identities in the context of
   a faculty development program. Approach This study adopted
   interpretative phenomenological analysis, which is an idiographic and
   inductive methodological approach that enables an in-depth examination
   of how people conceptualize their personal and social worlds. In-depth
   semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with six
   purposively sampled Brazilian clinical teachers who were attending a
   faculty development program. Each participant's lived experience was
   analyzed independently. Then, these individual analyses were compared
   against each other to identify convergence and divergence. Findings
   Participants recognized one identity, which was labeled as embedding
   identity, containing other identities and roles. Participants integrated
   their professional identities in agreement with their personal
   identities, values, and beliefs, striving thus for identity consonance.
   Participants understood their craft as a relational process by which
   they wove themselves into their context and entangled their experience
   with that of others. They, however, diverged when recognizing who their
   peers were; whereas some named a single professional group (i.e., family
   physicians), others had a more comprehensive view and considered as
   peers healthcare professionals, students, and even patients. Finally,
   participants identified time constraints and lower prestige of family
   medicine as a medical discipline vis-a-vis other specialties as
   challenges posed by their contexts. Insights Clinical teachers have
   multifaceted identities, to which they give a sense, manage, and
   integrate into their daily practice. Participants recognized an
   embedding identity and looked for common points between the identities
   it contained, which allowed them to meaningfully reconcile the different
   demands from their overlapping professional identities. Thus, this
   research introduces the notion of embedding identity as a strategy to
   make sense of many professional identities. Variability in the embedding
   identities depicted in this investigation suggests the fluid and
   contextualized character of professional identity development. How
   participants saw themselves also influenced how they behaved and
   interacted with others accordingly. Understanding clinical teacher
   identity development enriches current perspectives of what it is like to
   be one of these medical professionals. Faculty development programs
   ought to consider these perspectives to better support clinical teachers
   in meeting the overlapping demands in education and patient care.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the steps followed at the Escuela Tecnica Superior
   de Ingenieros Industriales (ETSII) at the Universidad Politecnica de
   Madrid (UPM) to progressively implement an outcomes assessment
   framework. This assessment is understood as the integral process to
   guide and guarantee that graduates, when they finish their studies, have
   acquired the knowledge, abilities and skills established in the program
   (i.e. outcomes). This is a process linked to the entire program (and not
   to a single course or activity) and to the cohort of students (and not
   to the evaluation of each student individually).
   At the ETSII, the outcomes assessment process has been designed in
   accordance with the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology
   (ABET) criteria which establishes 11 outcomes that must be fulfilled by
   the students as a necessary step in the accreditation process and as a
   preparation to attain the educational program objectives. The
   implementation of these 11 outcomes is intentionally unspecified by ABET
   to encourage each engineering program's faculty to achieve its own
   specificity considering its idiosyncrasy. This paper describes the
   approach followed in the ETSII to develop an integral strategy for the
   institution and to progressively evolve to an outcomes assessment
   culture. From this experience, some quite generalizable learned lessons
   are extracted that can be useful for other faculties involved in similar
   processes.},

Title = {A Methodological Approach to the Teaching STEM Skills in Latin America
   through Educational Robotics for School Teachers},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The study aims to design a methodological approach that allows
   educational robotics to develop STEM competences for schoolteachers, but
   with a gender focus. The phases within consist of designing a set of
   workshops with a gender approach, making use of Arduino, as it allows
   for introducing concepts in electronics and programming. For this, a
   mixed research method was applied, where quantitative and qualitative
   information was collected. The study was carried out with teachers from
   Latin American schools, where teachers from Chile and Colombia
   participated the most, and was conducted in virtual mode through the
   Zoom platform. As a result, it was found that Arduino and its components
   can be used to build projects that can be related in a real context,
   which further motivates students. It was also found that the levels of
   creativity, attitude, and motivation of the students increased with the
   workshops that were carried out.},

Abstract = {Industry 4.0 is widely accepted in manufacturing industry since it
   guides a novel and promising production paradigm. A new characteristic
   in Industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems is that the applications of
   advanced intelligent machines which have communication,
   self-optimization and self-training behaviors. Based on this new change,
   this study investigates a flow-shop scheduling problem under the
   consideration of multiple objectives, time-dependent processing time and
   uncertainty. A mixed integer programming model is formulated for this
   problem, and a fireworks algorithm is developed where some special
   strategies are designed, e.g., explosion sparks procedure and selection
   solution procedure. Simulation experiments on a set of test problems are
   carried out, and the experimental results demonstrate that the model and
   proposed algorithm can achieve a satisfactory performance by comparing
   with three state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithms. (C)

Title = {Breastfeeding training in Mexican health students may not be enough: A
   case analysis},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {108},

Abstract = {Background: Breastfeeding education is key to undergraduate nursing,
   nutrition, and medicine students' study programs. All students should be
   prepared to support and inform mothers about the best infant feeding
   methods. However, students may not be receiving adequate training to
   provide this support during their preparation. Objectives: The objective
   of this study was to explore if the Learning Units of the study programs
   of the bachelor's degrees in medicine, nursing, and nutrition,
   incorporate theoretical/practical content regarding breastfeeding and to
   evaluate whether these contents cover requirements related to knowledge
   and skills in breastfeeding recommended by international organizations
   for student's health area. Design: Descriptive. Methods: In the study
   programs of the bachelor's degrees, we identified the Learning Units
   that described theoretical/practical contents related to the subject of
   breastfeeding, to later contrast this training with the objectives in
   knowledge and skills in breastfeeding that the students in the health
   area should receive during their academic education, according to
   international recommendations. Results: The three study programs offer
   content on breastfeeding. The degrees in nursing and medicine manage to
   review a more significant number of training contents, unlike nutrition.
   However, the knowledge and skills targeted and identified do not seem to
   approach the knowledge and skills recommended by international
   institutions. Conclusions: Several knowledge and skills need to be
   addressed during the training of health students. Thematic content and
   educational strategies must be improved and implemented to improve their
   breastfeeding training.},

Title = {Improving hospital falls screening and mitigation using a health
   professional education framework},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {98},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objective: Although health professional education has the potential to
   mitigate hospital falls risk, the best methods to develop, deliver and
   evaluate health professional education remain unclear. This study
   applied evidence-based approaches to education design to improve falls
   risk mitigation. Design: Mixed methods using questionnaires to evaluate
   health professionals knowledge of evidence-based falls risk assessment
   and mitigation, followed by semi-structured interviews with individual
   health professionals. Setting: Five large Australian hospitals.
   Participants: For each hospital, 10 clinical leaders from nursing and
   allied health professions were invited to participate in falls
   workshops. Methods: 46 participants received a three-hour education
   program on the latest evidence in hospital falls risk assessment and how
   to implement evidence-based falls screening and management. This was
   based on the ``4P{''} education model (Presage, Planning, Process and
   Product). They were taught practical skills to enable them to educate
   other health professionals. Results: The education workshop
   significantly changed participants' views about best practice guidelines
   for falls screening and prevention. Participants felt more confident in
   assessing falls risk and judging and implementing the best mitigation
   strategies. They were prepared and motivated to educate others about
   falls prevention and satisfied with the skills gained. Conclusions: A
   high-quality education program grounded in a rigorous quality framework
   improved health professionals knowledge regarding evidence-based falls
   prevention. Use of evidence-based rationales for behaviour change
   promotes effective learning.},

Abstract = {Objective: Frailty is a prevalent risk factor for adverse outcomes among
   patients with chronic lung disease. However, identifying frail patients
   who may benefit from interventions is challenging using standard data
   sources. We therefore sought to identify phrases in clinical notes in
   the electronic health record (EHR) that describe actionable frailty
   syndromes.
   Materials and Methods: We used an active learning strategy to select
   notes from the EHR and annotated each sentence for 4 actionable aspects
   of frailty: respiratory impairment, musculoskeletal problems, fall risk,
   and nutritional deficiencies. We compared the performance of regression,
   tree-based, and neural network models to predict the labels for each
   sentence. We evaluated performance with the scaled Brier score (SBS),
   where 1 is perfect and 0 is uninformative, and the positive predictive
   value (PPV).
   Results: We manually annotated 155 952 sentences from 326 patients.
   Elastic net regression had the best performance across all 4 frailty
   aspects (SBS 0.52, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.49-0.54) followed
   by random forests (SBS 0.49, 95\% CI 0.47-0.51), and multi-task neural
   networks (SBS 0.39, 95\% CI 0.37-0.42). For the elastic net model, the
   PPV for identifying the presence of respiratory impairment was 54.8\%
   (95\% CI 53.3\%-56.6\%) at a sensitivity of 80\%.
   Discussion: Classificationmodels using EHR notes can effectively
   identify actionable aspects of frailty among patients living with
   chronic lung disease. Regression performed better than random forest and
   neural network models.
   Conclusions: NLP-based models offer promising support to population
   health management programs that seek to identify and refer
   community-dwelling patients with frailty for evidence-based
   interventions.},

Abstract = {Hyper-heuristic is a new methodology for the adaptive hybridization of
   meta-heuristic algorithms to derive a general algorithm for solving
   optimization problems. This work focuses on the selection type of
   hyper-heuristic, called the exponential Monte Carlo with counter (EMCQ).
   Current implementations rely on the memory-less selection that can be
   counterproductive as the selected search operator may not (historically)
   be the best performing operator for the current search instance.
   Addressing this issue, we propose to integrate the memory into EMCQ for
   combinatorial t-wise test suite generation using reinforcement learning
   based on the Q-learning mechanism, called Q-EMCQ. The limited
   application of combinatorial test generation on industrial programs can
   impact the use of such techniques as Q-EMCQ. Thus, there is a need to
   evaluate this kind of approach against relevant industrial software,
   with a purpose to show the degree of interaction required to cover the
   code as well as finding faults. We applied Q-EMCQ on 37 real-world
   industrial programs written in Function Block Diagram (FBD) language,
   which is used for developing a train control management system at
   Bombardier Transportation Sweden AB. The results show that Q-EMCQ is an
   efficient technique for test case generation. Addition- ally, unlike the
   t-wise test suite generation, which deals with the minimization problem,
   we have also subjected Q-EMCQ to a maximization problem involving the
   general module clustering to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
   approach. The results show the Q-EMCQ is also capable of outperforming
   the original EMCQ as well as several recent meta/hyper-heuristic
   including modified choice function, Tabu high-level hyper-heuristic,
   teaching learning-based optimization, sine cosine algorithm, and
   symbiotic optimization search in clustering quality within comparable
   execution time.},

Title = {An Appreciative Inquiry Approach to the Core Competencies: Taking it
   From Theory to Practice},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {77},
Number = {2},
Pages = {380-389},
Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To operationalize the surgical core competencies by using a
   qualitative inquiry strategy to explore how surgical competence is
   behaviorally demonstrated by faculty.
   DESIGN: Categorical general and vascular surgery residents completed a
   survey soliciting opinions regarding which faculty were deemed most
   representative of each core competency. The surveys served as a
   theoretical sample, as surgeons selected were then interviewed, and
   interviews transcribed. A qualitative research approach using grounded
   theory coding methods was used for transcript analysis. Iterative coding
   was performed, and emergent themes were then extracted from transcript
   analysis.
   SETTING: Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Department of
   Surgery in Springfield, IL, a tertiary academic center.
   PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen of 19 residents completed the survey (74\%
   response rate). Two surgeons were selected for each competency. A total
   of 7 interviews were performed, with 4 surgeons being chosen for 2
   competencies.
   RESULTS: Emergent themes revealed that competent surgeons shared
   qualities that drove their development and execution of each competency.
   These qualities included self-awareness, a selfless character,
   responsibility and ownership, context awareness, reliance on
   relationships and community, and a pattern of habit formation and
   discipline. Additionally, the competencies were noted to be pursued in
   an interrelated and interdependent fashion.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons deemed competent in any core domain shared common
   qualities. Further study exploring how each of these is identified,
   developed and taught is warranted. The competencies are an interrelated
   matrix whose development and execution correlates with foundational
   personal disciplines. (C) 2019 Association of Program Directors in

Title = {Workplace-Based Assessment in Cross-Border Health Professional Education},
Journal = {TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Construct: The globalization of healthcare has been accentuated by the
   export of health professional curricula overseas. Yet intact translation
   of pedagogies and practices devised in one cultural setting may not be
   possible or necessarily appropriate for alternate environments.
   Purposeful examination of workplace learning is necessary to understand
   how the source or ``home{''} program may need adapting in the
   distributed or ``host{''} setting. Background: Strategies to optimize
   cross-border medical education partnerships have been largely focused on
   elements of campus-based learning. Determining how host clinical
   supervisors approach assessment in experiential settings within a
   different culture and uphold the standards of home programs is relevant
   given the influence of context on trainees' demonstrated competencies.
   In this mixed-methods study, we sought to explore assessor judgments of
   student workplace-based performance made by preceptors sharing a
   pharmacy curriculum in Canada and Qatar. Approach: Using modified Delphi
   consensus technique, we asked clinical supervisors in Canada (n = 18)
   and in Qatar (n = 14) to categorize trainee performance as described in
   16 student vignettes. The proportion of ratings for three levels of
   expectation (exceeds, meets, or below) was calculated and within-country
   group consensus achieved if the level of agreement reached 80\%.
   Between-country group comparisons were measured using a chi-square
   statistic. We then conducted follow-up semi-structured interviews to
   gain further perspectives and clarify assessor rationale. Transcripts
   were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Results: The threshold
   for between-country group differences in assessor impressions was met
   for only two of the 16 student vignettes. Compared to Canadian clinical
   supervisors, relatively more preceptors in Qatar judged one described
   student as meets rather than exceeds expectations and one as meets
   rather than falls below expectations. Analysis of follow-up interviews
   exploring how culture may inform variations in assessor judgments
   identified themes associated with the profession, organization, learner,
   and supervisor performance theories but not their particular geographic
   context. Clinical supervisors in both countries were largely aligned in
   expectations of student knowledge, skills, and behaviors demonstrated in
   patient care and multidisciplinary team interactions. Conclusions: Our
   study demonstrated that variation in student assessment was more
   frequent among clinical supervisors within the same national context
   than any differences identified between the two countries. In these
   program settings, national sociocultural norms did not predict global
   assessor impressions or competency-specific judgments; instead,
   professional and organizational cultures were more likely to inform
   student characterizations of performance in workplace-based settings.
   Further study situated within the specific experiential learning
   contexts of cross-border health professional curricula is assuredly
   warranted.},

Title = {Final-year nursing students' foundational knowledge and self-assessed
   confidence in interpreting cardiac arrhythmias: A cross-sectional study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {97},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background: Graduating nurses should possess knowledge and understanding
   of cardiac arrhythmia interpretation, so they can assess abnormal and
   life-threatening arrhythmias. However, literature around nursing
   students' foundational knowledge in cardiac arrhythmia interpretation
   remains scarce.
   Objectives: To examine final-year nursing students' foundational
   knowledge and self-assessed confidence in interpreting cardiac
   arrhythmias.
   Design: Cross-sectional study design.
   Settings: Two Australian universities (one regional and the other large
   metropolitan).
   Participants: Nursing students in the final year of a program of study
   leading to initial registration as a registered nurse.
   Methods: An online survey was adopted to examine final-year nursing
   students' foundational knowledge and their self-assessed confidence when
   interpreting cardiac rhythms.
   Results: A total of 114 participants completed surveys, representing a
   response rate of 22\%. More than 70\% of the participants were able to
   interpret asystole, sinus rhythm, and sinus bradycardia. Over 50\%
   correctly identified ventricular tachycardia, atrial flutter, sinus
   tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular fibrillation. Under
   15\% of the participants were able to interpret junctional rhythm, paced
   rhythm, and unifocal/multifocal premature ventricular contractions.
   Self-assessed confidence levels were generally lower than the accuracy
   rates of arrhythmia interpretation. Although many participants
   acknowledged that learning arrhythmia interpretation was difficult and
   challenging, most of them had positive perceptions and wanted to learn
   more.
   Conclusion: Nursing curricula need to be supported and strategies need
   to be implemented to standardise educational electrocardiogram
   interpretation programs, which are critical to improving final-year
   nursing students' foundational knowledge and confidence in interpreting
   cardiac arrhythmias and enhancing patient safety.},

Title = {A Primer on the Military Health System's Approach to Medical Research
   and Development},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {95},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1652-1657},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Military Health System (MHS) has a medical research program aimed at
   a wide range of health-, disease-, and injury-related topic areas that
   works with civilian academic institutions and the biomedical industry to
   accomplish its goals. There are many opportunities for civilian academic
   institutions and the biomedical industry to engage with this program,
   but its unique features are important to understand to optimize the
   chances for successful partnerships. Unlike the National Institutes of
   Health, which uses an ``investigator-initiated{''} approach, the
   Department of Defense (DoD) aligns its funding with specific needs, also
   referred to as requirements; thus, DoD research is often described as
   ``requirements-driven{''} research. At the highest level, requirements
   are aligned with the National Security Strategy and National Defense
   Strategy, though requirements documents list specific areas in medicine
   with unmet needs. Military labs and the Uniformed Services University of
   the Health Sciences, which can also receive DoD appropriations to
   conduct medical research, serve as hubs that interface with civilian
   academic institutions and the biomedical industry and organize and track
   the overall progress of DoD investments. As a mechanism to propel
   findings from ``bench to bedside,{''} the military budgets funds for the
   various phases of research and development for a given topic area.
   Research programs are most effective when they are integrated into the
   MHS learning health system, which allows MHS clinical communities to
   inform and track research investments and evaluate the utility of
   research products in real clinical practice settings. This Perspective
   provides introductory information and a basic framework for those
   interested in performing DoD-funded medical research or collaborating
   with researchers in military labs. It is hoped that as academic
   institutions and the biomedical industry look to increase efficiency in
   medical research, they will find ways to engage with DoD research
   opportunities and consider elements of the military's approach useful.},

Title = {Self-reflection during first clinical practice: The experiences of
   nursing students},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {72},
Pages = {61-66},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: Self-reflection can be used as a tool for describing student
   experiences and have a significant impact on their learning. It enables
   nursing students to develop the ability to identify and analyse their
   problems and find possible solutions.
   Objective: To present students' self-reflection in their first clinical
   practice as their first stage of our nursing study program.
   Methodology: The research was based on a naturalistic philosophical
   paradigm using a qualitative methodological approach. The research took
   place at one of the Slovenian universities with an undergraduate nursing
   education program. Purposive sampling was chosen. The data were obtained
   through written self-reflection diary entries collected between March
   and June 2016. A thematic analysis was selected for data analysis.
   Ensuring that all ethical considerations were covered, seventeen
   students in the first clinical practice were included.
   Findings: Three main thematic themes were identified that define the
   experience of students in their first clinical practice: (1) emotional
   experience, (2) interpersonal relationships, (3) learning.
   Conclusions: The research has found that the experiences and the
   perceptions of students in the first clinical practice are mainly
   expressed emotionally. Self-reflection helps students to express
   emotions and feelings to reliving and to identifying problems and also,
   to understanding themselves better. Further research should be focused
   on the importance of the students' self-reflections in their
   professional and personal growth.},

Title = {An Adaptive Industrial Control Equipment Safety Fault Diagnosis Method
   in Industrial Internet of Things},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {With the rapid development of intelligent manufacturing and Industrial
   Internet of Things, many industrial control systems have high
   requirements for the security of the system itself. Failures of
   industrial control equipment will cause abnormal operation of industrial
   control equipment and waste of resources. It is very meaningful to
   detect and identify potential equipment abnormalities and failures in
   time and implement effective fault tolerance strategies. In the
   Industrial Internet of Things environment, the instructions and
   parameters of industrial control equipment often change due to changes
   in actual requirements. However, it is impractical to customize the
   learning method for each parameter value. Aiming at the problem, this
   paper proposes a fault diagnosis model based on ensemble learning and
   proposes a method of updating voting weights based on dynamic
   programming to assist decision-making. This method is based on Bagging
   strategy and combined with dynamic programming voting weight adjustment
   method to complete fault type prediction. Finally, this paper uses
   different loads as dynamic conditions; the diagnostic capability of the
   Bagging-based fault diagnosis integrated model in a dynamically changing
   industrial control system environment is verified by experiments. The
   fault diagnosis model of industrial control equipment based on ensemble
   learning effectively improves the adaptive ability of the model and
   makes the fault diagnosis framework truly intelligent. The voting weight
   adjustment method based on dynamic programming further improves the
   reliability of voting.},

Title = {An expandable approach for design and personalization of digital,

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION},

Abstract = {Objective: We aim to deliver a framework with 2 main objectives: 1)
   facilitating the design of theory-driven, adaptive, digital
   interventions addressing chronic illnesses or health problems and 2)
   producing personalized intervention delivery strategies to support
   self-management by optimizing various intervention components tailored
   to people's individual needs, momentary contexts, and psychosocial
   variables.
   Materials and Methods: We propose a template-based digital intervention
   design mechanism enabling the configuration of evidence-based,
   just-in-time, adaptive intervention components. The design mechanism
   incorporates a rule definition language enabling experts to specify
   triggering conditions for interventions based on momentary and
   historical contextual/personal data. The framework continuously monitors
   and processes personal data space and evaluates intervention-triggering
   conditions. We benefit from reinforcement learning methods to develop
   personalized intervention delivery strategies with respect to timing,
   frequency, and type (content) of interventions. To validate the
   personalization algorithm, we lay out a simulation testbed with 2
   personas, differing in their various simulated real-life conditions.
   Results: We evaluate the design mechanism by presenting example
   intervention definitions based on behavior change taxonomies and
   clinical guidelines. Furthermore, we provide intervention definitions
   for a real-world care program targeting diabetes patients. Finally, we
   validate the personalized delivery mechanism through a set of
   hypotheses, asserting certain ways of adaptation in the delivery
   strategy, according to the differences in simulation related to personal
   preferences, traits, and lifestyle patterns.
   Conclusion: While the design mechanism is sufficiently expandable to
   meet the theoretical and clinical intervention design requirements, the
   personalization algorithm is capable of adapting intervention delivery
   strategies for simulated real-life conditions.},

Title = {Incentives for clinical teachers: On why their complex influences should
   lead us to proceed with caution},

Abstract = {Introduction When medical education programs have difficulties
   recruiting or retaining clinical teachers, they often introduce
   incentives to help improve motivation. Previous research, however, has
   shown incentives can unfortunately have unintended consequences. When
   and why that is the case in the context of incentivizing clinical
   teachers remains unclear. The purposes of this study, therefore, were to
   understand what values and motivations influence teaching decisions; and
   to delve deeper into how teaching incentives have been perceived.
   Methods An interpretive description methodology was used to improve
   understanding of the development and delivery of teaching incentives. A
   purposeful sampling strategy identified a heterogenous sample of
   clinical faculty teaching in undergraduate and postgraduate contexts.
   Sixteen semi-structured interviews were conducted and transcripts were
   analyzed using an iterative process to develop a thematic structure that
   accounts for general trends and individual variations.
   Results Clinicians articulated interrelated and dynamic personal and
   environmental factors that had linear, dual-edged and inverted U-shaped
   impacts on their motivations towards teaching. Barriers were frequently
   rationalized away, but cumulative barriers often led to teaching
   attrition. Clinical teachers were motivated when they felt valued and
   connected to their learners, peers, leadership, and/or the medical
   education community. While incentives aimed at producing these
   connections could be perceived as supportive, they could also negatively
   impact motivation if they were impersonal, inequitable, inefficient, or
   poorly framed.
   Discussion/Conclusion These findings reinforce the literature suggesting
   that it is necessary to proceed with caution when labeling any
   particular factor as a motivator or barrier to teaching. They take us
   deeper, however, towards understanding how and why clinical teachers'
   perceptions are unique, dynamic and fluid. Incentive schemes can be
   beneficial for teacher recruitment and retention, but must be designed
   with nuance that takes into account what makes clinicians feel valued if
   the strategy is to do more good than harm.},

Title = {Exploring the implications of a self-care assignment to foster
   undergraduate nursing student mental health: Findings from a survey
   research study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {81},
Pages = {13-18},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Nursing students experience numerous personal, academic, and
   practice-related stressors, impacting their mental health. Nursing
   programs often contribute to student stress and should incorporate
   strategies to support students' mental health. Self-care has the
   potential to enhance students' ability to manage current stressors and
   to build capacity for addressing future stress and burnout; however, the
   concept has been limitedly integrated into nursing education.
   Objectives: To examine students' responses to a self-care assignment
   integrated into core nursing coursework.
   Design: Cross-sectional study using an online survey.
   Settings: An accelerated two-year undergraduate nursing program in
   Western Canada.
   Participants: Undergraduate nursing students in first- and second-year
   of a two-year program.
   Methods: A 16-question survey, including closed- and open-ended response
   fields was developed by the research team. Survey questions were
   grounded in Bloom's Cognitive, Psychomotor, and Affective learning
   domains to comprehensively examine the impact of the assignment on
   students' learning and self-care capacity.
   Results: 89 participants completed the survey (49\% response rate).
   Participants' increase in self-care practices pre- and post-assignment
   was statistically significant (p = 0.023). Results further demonstrate
   that students' knowledge of self-care and capacity to identify and
   manage stressors were enhanced. Participants reported that overall the
   assignment supported their well-being. However, some participants
   described that aspects of the assignment detracted from well-being,
   including challenges with grading and feelings of guilt when not
   practicing self-care.
   Conclusions: A self-care assignment is an effective strategy for nursing
   educators to foster students' capacity to cope with stressors.},

Title = {Does the use of annotated exemplars by nursing students predict academic
   performance? A cohort study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {80},
Pages = {34-39},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Aims: To examine the usefulness of the annotated exemplar as an academic
   support strategy, and explore the characteristics of students who were
   more likely to engage with this academic support tool. Additionally, to
   identify if there was any influence on the academic performance in the
   assessment activity among those who engaged with the annotated exemplar.
   Background: Annotated exemplars have the potential to target students en
   masse and provide meaningful, task specific comments that guide students
   prior to assessment submission. Effective strategies to support student
   learning are needed as nursing students are increasingly entering
   tertiary studies from non-traditional backgrounds.
   Design: A cohort study was used to collect administrative data, academic
   grades and annotated exemplar usage statistics.
   Setting: A large multi-campus university in NSW, Australia during Spring
   semester 2016.
   Participants: Second year undergraduate students enrolled in a single
   unit in the Bachelor of Nursing Program.
   Methods: Quantitative data related to marks, grades and usage
   information; and demographic data and contact details were extracted
   from the online learning management system and student electronic
   records.
   Results: Of the 1120 students enrolled in the unit, 49.5\% of students
   engaged with the annotated exemplar. Students more likely to engage with
   the tool were older, female, born outside of Australia and had higher
   hit rates on the online learning management site. Of those who engaged
   with the annotated exemplar, there was no demonstrated increase in
   assessment mark.
   Conclusion: To improve student performance it is essential that feedback
   is engaging and effective. While, in this study, use of the annotated
   exemplar was not reflected in student marks, it is unclear how students
   may have performed without access to the exemplar. Further research is
   required to explore the reasons why students did not engage with the
   annotated exemplar and, for those who did, why the intervention did not
   impact on assessment mark.},

Abstract = {Paraeducators are foundational to the success of inclusive education
   programs, yet little is known about how students experience their
   support over time. The aim of the study was to determine the meaning of
   the physical and symbolic presence of paraeducator support in physical
   education across elementary (approximately ages 6-11), middle (ages
   12-14), and high school years (ages 15-18) for students experiencing
   physical impairment. Using an interpretative phenomenological analysis
   and life story research approach, data were retrospectively gathered as
   the participants looked back on their school experiences. The thematic
   analysis of one-on-one semi-structured interviews of five participants
   (3 women and 2 men), aged 18-30 years (average age 23) generated three
   themes. The themes were (a) initially I didn't question their
   (in)action, (b) over time, their presence created social interaction
   barriers, and (c) blurred boundaries of friendship, independence, and
   interdependence. Relational ethics provided the conceptual framework for
   the study. In elementary school, the participants reflected on their
   impoverished engagement in physical education as their paraeducators
   looked on. In early middle school, the physical presence and over
   protection of paraeducators thwarted social skill development leading to
   social dependence, distancing the participants from their peers. Toward
   late middle school, the participants found themselves negotiating
   relational boundaries to gain independence yet preserve beneficial
   interdependence. In high school the participants lamented the loss of
   their paraeducators as valuable communication conduits, leaving them
   feeling abandoned. The participants recommended that during the
   elementary years paraeducators provide meaningful strategies for
   participation. Further, during upper elementary and middle school years,
   paraeducator support should be discretionary, with students (and
   parents) determining support requirements, in anticipation of an
   increasing need for autonomy during high school years.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a novel method for the prediction of building floor
   plans based on sparse observations in the absence of measurements. We
   derive the most likely hypothesis using a maximum a posteriori
   probability approach. Background knowledge consisting of probability
   density functions of room shape and location parameters is learned from
   training data. Relations between rooms and room substructures are
   represented by linear and bilinear constraints. We perform reasoning on
   different levels providing a problem solution that is optimal with
   regard to the given information. In a first step, the problem is modeled
   as a constraint satisfaction problem. Constraint Logic Programming
   derives a solution which is topologically correct but suboptimal with
   regard to the geometric parameters. The search space is reduced using
   architectural constraints and browsed by intelligent search strategies
   which use domain knowledge. In a second step, graphical models are used
   for updating the initial hypothesis and refining its continuous
   parameters. We make use of Gaussian mixtures for model parameters in
   order to represent background knowledge and to get access to established
   methods for efficient and exact stochastic reasoning. We demonstrate our
   approach on different illustrative examples. Initially, we assume that
   floor plans are rectangular and that rooms are rectangles and discuss
   more general shapes afterwards. In a similar spirit, we predict door
   locations providing further important components of 3D indoor models.},

Title = {Self-efficacy and concerns of nursing students regarding clinical
   experiences},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {90},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: It is important for nurses to provide safe, high-quality
   care for patients, and clinical experiences allow nursing students to
   integrate theory into practice. However, many students have anxiety
   about clinical rotations.
   Objectives: The concerns of nursing students about clinical experiences
   and factors relating to self-efficacy in a rural Bachelor of Science in
   Nursing (BSN) program were examined.
   Design: This was a mixed-methods study, and students were surveyed prior
   to and at the end of their clinical experiences.
   Setting: The study location is a public liberal arts university in the
   rural, southeast United States.
   Participants: Junior level students (first and second semester) and
   senior level students (first and second semester) levels of BSN students
   participated in this project.
   Results: Qualitative themes were identified, including concerns
   regarding clinical competence, expectations of learning, aspects of
   patient/peer/instructor interactions, as well as learning strategies and
   preferences. The student's level of confidence regarding communication
   to patients and physicians, assessment of heart and lung sounds,
   interview skills, documentation, and discussion of nursing procedures
   increased significantly from pre to post-survey. Confidence levels in
   physical assessment skills rose significantly after the clinical
   experience (t' = -6.3718 with 140 df, p < .001).
   Conclusion: Strategies that nurse educators can use prior to, during,
   and after the clinical experience to address student concerns about
   clinical experiences include the use of caring, competent clinical
   instructors, orientation to clinical sites, laboratory and simulation
   days, self-reflection, peer-support, and debriefing.

Abstract = {The demand for biomedical researchers and health science professionals
   has increased over the past several decades. This need is particularly
   acute in the fields of cancer research and oncology in which
   technological advances have fueled an unprecedented pace of laboratory
   discoveries and their applications in novel diagnostic and therapeutic
   strategies. Internships that expose undergraduate students to cancer
   research and patient care serve an important function in meeting this
   need by educating trainees about careers in this field and inspiring
   them to pursue these professional paths. Moreover, the translational
   impetus of cancer research incorporates research, regulatory, business,
   and clinical components, providing students with even more
   cancer-focused career options. With the goal of providing hands-on
   experiences in cancer research and oncology to undergraduate students
   who comprise the next generation of cancer physician-scientists and will
   fill this demand in our professional workforce, the Nathan Schnaper
   Intern Program in Translational Cancer Research (NSIP) has grown from a
   small laboratory-based local summer internship to a competitive national
   program. In this study, we evaluate three new modules of the NSIP
   research, education, and clinical components that have been implemented
   in the first 2 years of National Cancer Institute Cancer Research
   Education Grants Program funding. The impact of these modules on intern
   satisfaction, learning, and near-term career trajectory is assessed to
   identify the most effective approaches and key measures of program
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {The International Competency-Based Medical Education (ICBME)
   Collaborators have been working since 2009 to promote understanding of
   competency-based medical education (CBME) and accelerate its uptake
   worldwide. This article presents a charter, supported by a
   literature-based rationale, which is meant to provide a shared mental
   model of CBME that will serve as a path forward in its widespread
   implementation.
   At a 2013 summit, the ICBME Collaborators laid the groundwork for this
   charter. Here, the fundamental principles of CBME and professional
   responsibilities of medical educators in its implementation process are
   described. The authors outline three fundamental principles: (1) Medical
   education must be based on the health needs of the populations served;
   (2) the primary focus of education and training should be the desired
   outcomes for learners rather than the structure and process of the
   educational system; and (3) the formation of a physician should be
   seamless across the continuum of education, training, and practice.
   Building on these principles, medical educators must demonstrate
   commitment to teaching, assessing, and role modeling the range of
   identified competencies. In the clinical setting, they must provide
   supervision that balances patient safety with the professional
   development of learners, being transparent with stakeholders about level
   of supervision needed. They must use effective and efficient assessment
   strategies and tools for basing transition decisions on competence
   rather than time in training, empowering learners to be active
   participants in their learning and assessment. Finally, advancing CBME
   requires program evaluation and research, faculty development, and a
   collaborative approach to realize its full potential.},

Title = {TrustEd: A Tool for Developing Intraoperative Entrustment Skills},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Toolkits to assess progressive resident autonomy are integral
   to the movement toward competency-based surgical education. OpTrust is
   one such tool validated for intraoperative assessment of both faculty
   and resident entrustment behaviors. We developed a supplementary tool to
   OpTrust that would aid faculty and residents in making meaningful
   improvements in entrustment behavior by providing talking points and
   reflection items tailored to different motivational styles as defined by
   Regulatory Focus Theory (RFT).\& nbsp;DESIGN: Existing literature about
   surgical entrustment was used to build a list of sample dialogue and
   self -reflection items to use in the operating room. This list was
   distributed as a survey to individuals familiar with OpTrust and RFT,
   asking them to categorize each item as Promotion-oriented,
   Prevention-oriented, or Either. The respondents then met to discuss
   survey items that did not reach a consensus until the group agreed on
   their categorization.\& nbsp;SETTING: University of Wisconsin, School of
   Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin Michigan Medicine, Ann
   Arbor, Michigan \& nbsp;PARTICIPANTS: Clinician and education
   researchers familiar with intraoperative entrustment and RFT \&
   nbsp;RESULTS: Eight respondents completed the survey categorizing the
   talking points and reflection items by RFT (100\% response rate). Six of
   these respondents attended the additional meeting to discuss discordant
   items. The input from this panel was used to develop ``TrustEd, `` the
   supplementary tool that faculty and residents can quickly reference
   before beginning a case.\& nbsp;CONCLUSION: Although tools such as
   OpTrust allow intraoperative entrustment behaviors to be quantified,
   TrustEd offers concrete strategies for faculty and residents who are
   interested in improving those behaviors over time. Further study is
   needed to assess whether the use of TrustEd does in fact lead to durable
   behavior change and improvement in OpTrust scores. (C)\& nbsp;2021

Title = {Association of Characteristics, Deficits, and Outcomes of Residents
   Placed on Probation at One Institution, 2002-2012},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {91},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Purpose
   To describe the population of residents placed on probation, identify
   learner characteristics associated with being placed on probation, and
   describe immediate and long-term career outcomes for those placed on
   probation as compared with matched controls.
   Method
   The authors collected data for residents at the University of Colorado
   School of Medicine placed on probation from July 2002 to June 2012,
   including postgraduate year placed on probation, deficits identified,
   mandated evaluation for physical and mental health, duration of
   probation, disability accommodations requested, and number of additional
   training months required. They were retrospectively compared with 102
   controls matched for specialty, matriculation, and postgraduate year.
   Variables assessed included demographics, academic performance, license
   status, specialty, state board certification, and board citations.
   Results
   Of 3,091 residents, 3.3\% were placed on probation (88 residents; 14
   fellows). Compared with controls, those on probation were more likely to
   be international medical graduates, married, not Caucasian, older (all P
   < .001), male (P = .01), to have transferred from another graduate
   medical education training program, and to have taken time off between
   medical school and residency (all P < .001). Among those currently in
   practice, 53 (63.9\%) were board certified compared with 93 (100\%) of
   the controls. Placement on probation was associated with failure to
   graduate and lack of board certification. All 7 graduates cited by state
   medical boards were in the probation group.
   Conclusions
   Further research is needed to understand these associations and to
   determine whether changes in curricula or remediation programs may alter
   these outcomes.},

Title = {``It's not my dream, actually{''}: students' identity work across
   figured worlds of construction engineering in Sweden},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Background Research in engineering education has pointed to the need for
   new engineers to develop a broader skill-set with an emphasis on softer
   social skills. However, there remains strong tensions in the identity
   work that engineers must engage in to balance the technical demands of
   the discipline with the new emphasis on heterogeneous skills (Faulkner,
   Social Studies of Science 37:331-356, 2007). This study explores how
   three unconventional students experience these tensions in the final
   year of their construction engineering program, and as they move in and
   out of workplace field experiences.
   Results Using a figured worlds framework (Holland et al., Identity and
   agency in cultural worlds, 1998), we explore the dominant subject
   positions for students in construction engineering classroom and
   workplaces in a 3-year Swedish engineering program. Results demonstrate
   that dominant subject positions for construction engineers can trouble
   students' identity work as they move across classroom and workplace
   settings.
   Conclusions This study expands our knowledge of the complexity of
   students' identity work across classroom and workplace settings. The
   emergence of classroom and workplace masculinities that shape the
   dominant subject positions available to students are shown to trouble
   the identity work that students engage in as they move across these
   learning spaces. We examine students' identity strategies that
   contribute to their persistence through the field. Finally, we discuss
   implications for teaching and research in light of students' movements
   across these educational contexts.},

Abstract = {Biomedical information mining is increasingly recognized as a promising
   technique to accelerate drug discovery and development. Especially,
   integrative approaches which mine data from several (open) data sources
   have become more attractive with the increasing possibilities to
   programmatically access data through Application Programming Interfaces
   (APIs). The use of open data in conjunction with free,
   platform-independent analytic tools provides the additional advantage of
   flexibility, re-usability, and transparency. Here, we present a strategy
   for performing ligand-based in silico drug repurposing with the
   analytics platform KNIME. We demonstrate the usefulness of the developed
   workflow on the basis of two different use cases: a rare disease (here:
   Glucose Transporter Type 1 (GLUT-1) deficiency), and a new disease
   (here: COVID 19). The workflow includes a targeted download of data
   through web services, data curation, detection of enriched structural
   patterns, as well as substructure searches in DrugBank and a recently
   deposited data set of antiviral drugs provided by Chemical s Service.
   Developed workflows, tutorials with detailed step-by-step instructions,
   and the information gained by the analysis of data for GLUT-1 deficiency
   syndrome and COVID-19 are made freely available to the scientific
   community. The provided framework can be reused by researchers for other
   in silico drug repurposing projects, and it should serve as a valuable
   teaching resource for conveying integrative data mining strategies.},

Title = {Cost Comparison of Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery Training
   Completed With Standard Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery Equipment
   versus Low-Cost Equipment},

Volume = {74},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Training for the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS)
   skills test can be expensive. Previous work demonstrated that training
   on an ergonomically different, low-cost platform does not affect FLS
   skills test outcomes. This study compares the average training cost with
   standard FLS equipment and medical-grade consumables versus training on
   a lower cost platform with non medical-grade consumables.
   DESIGN: Subjects were prospectively randomized to either the standard
   FLS training platform (n = 19) with medical grade consumables (S-FLS),
   or the low-cost platform (n = 20) with training-grade products (LC-FLS).
   Both groups trained to proficiency using previously established mastery
   learning standards on the 5 FLS tasks. The fixed and consumable cost
   differences were compared.
   SETTING: Training occurred in a surgical simulation center.
   PARTICIPANTS: Laparoscopic novice medical student and resident physician
   health care professionals who had not completed the national FLS
   proficiency curriculum and who had performed less than 10 laparoscopic
   cases.
   RESULTS: The fixed cost of the platform was considerably higher in the
   S-FLS group (S-FLS, \$3360; LC-FLS, \$879), and the average consumable
   training cost was significantly higher for the S-FLS group (S-FLS,
   \$1384.52; LC-FLS, \$153.79; p < 0.001). The LC-FLS group had a
   statistically discernable cost reduction for each consumable (Gauze
   \$9.24 vs. \$0.39, p = 0.002; EndoLoop \$540.00 vs. \$40.60, p < 0.001;
   extracorporeal suture \$216.45 vs. \$25.20, p < 0.001; intracorporeal
   suture \$618.83 vs. \$87.60, p < 0.001). The annual fixed and consumable
   cost to train 5 residents is \$10,282.60 in the S-FLS group versus
   \$1647.95 in the LC-FLS group.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the average cost to train a single
   trainee to proficiency using a lower fixed cost platform and non
   medical-grade equipment results in significant financial savings. A
   5-resident program will save approximately \$8500 annually. Residency
   programs should consider adopting this strategy to reduce the cost of
   FLS training. (Published by Elsevier Inc on behalf of the Association of

Abstract = {Background Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) play a big role in
   minimizing antimicrobial resistance. Pharmacists are essential members
   of the health care team and in order for them to fulfill roles on ASP
   teams and become antimicrobial stewards, they must be prepared
   adequately by pharmacy schools prior to entry into actual practice.
   Although programming has been implemented into entry-to-practice
   programs worldwide, little is known about how students interpret
   antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) data and arrive at clinical decisions.
   We aimed to explore students' cognitive processes and determine how they
   formulate therapeutic decisions when presented with AMS cases. Methods
   This was a qualitative study conducted using a case study approach, in
   which a sample (n=20) of pharmacy students was recruited to interpret
   AMS cases. Semi-structured 1-on-1 interviews were arranged with each
   participant. A think-aloud procedure with verbal protocol analysis was
   adopted to determine students' decision-making processes. Thematic
   analysis was used to interpret themes from the interview data. Results
   Two themes were interpreted from the data: students' focus and students'
   approach to case interpretation. Students' focus relates to external
   factors students consider when interpreting AMS case data and use to
   make and justify therapeutic decisions including patient-centered
   factors, drug-related factors, AMS interventions, and pharmacist's role.
   Students' clinical reasoning describes the approach that students use to
   interpret the data and the decision-making processes they employ to
   arrive at a clinical decision including a systematic approach versus
   non-systematic approach. Conclusions Students vary in their focus and
   the cognitive strategies used to interpret AMS cases. Findings support
   the notion that clinical reasoning and decision-making should be
   explicitly taught in pharmacy curricula, in order to help students
   become aware of their own cognitive processes and decision-making
   abilities.},

Title = {Educational System Factors That Engage Resident Physicians in an
   Integrated Quality Improvement Curriculum at a VA Hospital: A Realist
   Evaluation},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {89},
Number = {10},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Purpose
   Learning about quality improvement (QI) in resident physician training
   is often relegated to elective or noncore clinical activities. The
   authors integrated teaching, learning, and doing QI into the routine
   clinical work of inpatient internal medicine teams at a Veterans Affairs
   (VA) hospital. This study describes the design factors that facilitated
   and inhibited the integration of a QI curriculum-including real QI
   work-into the routine work of inpatient internal medicine teams.
   Method
   A realist evaluation framework used three data sources: field notes from
   QI faculty; semistructured interviews with resident physicians; and a
   group interview with QI faculty and staff. From April 2011 to July 2012,
   resident physician teams at the White River Junction VA Medical Center
   used the Model for Improvement for their QI work and analyzed data using
   statistical process control charts.
   Results
   Three domains affected the delivery of the QI curriculum and engagement
   of residents in QI work: setting, learner, and teacher. The constant
   presence of the QI material on a public space in the team workroom was a
   facilitating mechanism in the setting. Explicit sign-out of QI work to
   the next resident team formalized the handoff in the learner domain. QI
   teachers who were respected clinical leaders with QI expertise provided
   role modeling and local system knowledge.
   Conclusions
   Integrating QI teaching into the routine clinical and educational
   systems of an inpatient service is challenging. Identifiable, concrete
   strategies in the setting, learner, and teacher domains helped integrate
   QI into the clinical and educational systems.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The System for Improving and Measuring Procedural Learning
   (SIMPL) is a smart-phone application used to provide residents with an
   evaluation of operative autonomy and feedback. This study investigated
   the perceived benefits and barriers to app use.
   DESIGN: A database of previously performed SIMPL evaluations was
   analyzed to identify high, low, and never users. Potential predisposing
   factors to use were explored. A survey investigating key areas of value
   and barriers to use for the SIMPL application was sent to resident and
   faculty users. Respondents were asked to self identify how often they
   used the app. The perceived benefits and barriers were correlated with
   the level of usage. Qualitative analysis of free text responses was used
   to determine strategies to increase usage.
   SETTING: General surgery training programs who are members of the
   Procedural Learning and Safety Collaborative.
   PARTICIPANTS: Surgical residents and faculty.
   RESULTS: At least 1 SIMPL evaluation was created for 411 residents and
   524 faculty. Thirty percent of both faculty and residents were
   high-frequency users. Thirty percent of faculty were never users. One
   hundred eighty-eight residents and 207 faculty (response rate 46\%)
   completed the survey. High-frequency resident users were more likely to
   perceive a benefit for both numerical evaluations (76\% vs 30\%) and
   dictated feedback (92\% vs 30\%). Faculty and residents commonly blamed
   each other for not creating and completing evaluations regularly (87\%
   of residents, 81\% of faculty). Suggested strategies to increase usage
   included reminders and integration with existing data systems.
   CONTRIBUTIONS: Frequent users perceive value from the application,
   particularly from dictated feedback and see a positive impact on
   feedback in their programs. Faculty engagement represents a major

Abstract = {Many outpatient clinics where health professionals train will transition
   to a team-based medical home model over the next several years.
   Therefore, training programs need innovative approaches to prepare and
   incorporate trainees into team-based delivery systems. To address this
   need, educators at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical
   Center included trainees in preclinic team huddles, or briefing meetings
   to facilitate care coordination, and developed an interprofessional
   huddle-coaching program for nurse practitioner students and internal
   medicine residents who function as primary providers for patient panels
   in VA outpatient primary care clinics. The program aimed to support
   trainees' partnerships with staff and full participation in the VA's
   Patient Aligned Care Teams. The huddle-coaching program focuses on
   structuring the huddle process via scheduling, checklists, and
   designated huddle coaches; building relationships among team members
   through team-building activities; and teaching core skills to support
   collaborative practice. A multifaceted evaluation of the program showed
   positive results. Participants rated training sessions and team-building
   activities favorably. In interviews, trainees valued their team members
   and identified improvements in efficiency and quality of patient care as
   a result of the team-based approach. Huddle checklists and scores on the
   Team Development Measure indicated progress in team processes and
   relationships as the year progressed. These findings suggest that the
   huddle-coaching program was a worthwhile investment in trainee
   development that also supported the clinic's larger mission to deliver
   team-based, patient-aligned care. As more training sites shift to
   team-based care, the huddle-coaching program offers a strategy for
   successfully incorporating trainees.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND Because healthy habits are established early in life, it is
   important to teach young children about foods that contribute to a
   healthy diet. One of the strategies recommended by the 2015-2020 Dietary
   Guidelines is to implement educational programs in community settings
   such as child care and preschool settings. Head Start is one such
   educational child care setting that serves young children ages 3 to 5
   years old. METHODS A community partnership was established between
   Jackson County Civic Action Agency and supported by the Mississippi Gulf
   Coast Youth Health Coalition's Childhood Obesity Initiative. A
   quasi-experimental nonequivalent 2-group pre/post-test study design was
   utilized to determine the effectiveness of a 12-week physical activity
   and nutrition education program delivered in a Head Start setting.
   RESULTS There was a statistically significant improvement in fruit (F =
   5.602, df = 1, p = .018) and vegetable (F = 16.061, df = 1, p < .001)
   recognition scores, and the number of ``tried and liked{''} fruits (F =
   5.579, df = 1, p = .019) and vegetables (F = 88.559, df = 1, p < .001)
   between children in the control group (n = 86) and intervention group (n
   = 303) when controlling for scores at baseline. CONCLUSION Utilizing the
   Head Start program as a setting for health education program delivery is
   one available strategy to combat childhood obesity on a community level.},

Abstract = {SEQUEST is a database-searching engine, which calculates the correlation
   score between observed spectrum and theoretical spectrum deduced from
   protein sequences stored in a flat text file, even though it is not a
   relational and object-oriental repository. Nevertheless, the SEQUEST
   score functions fail to discriminate between true and false PSMs
   accurately. Some approaches, such as Peptide Prophet and Percolator,
   have been proposed to address the task of distinguishing true and false
   PSMs. However, most of these methods employ time-consuming learning
   algorithms to validate peptide assignments {[}1]. In this paper, we
   propose a fast algorithm for validating peptide identification by
   incorporating heterogeneous information from SEQUEST scores and peptide
   digested knowledge. To automate the peptide identification process and
   incorporate additional information, we employ l(2) multiple kernel
   learning (MKL) to implement the current peptide identification task.
   Results on experimental datasets indicate that compared with
   state-of-the-art methods, i.e., PeptideProphet and Percolator, our data
   fusing strategy has comparable performance but reduces the running time
   significantly.},

Title = {Design and implementation characteristics of research training for rural
   health professionals: a qualitative descriptive study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {BackgroundResearch capacity and capability of rural health professionals
   is essential to the delivery of evidence-based care and for informing
   strategies to address rural health inequities. Effective implementation
   of research education and training is fundamental to building rural
   health professional research capacity and capability. A lack of
   overarching guidance to inform the delivery of research education and
   training in rural health services can contribute to gaps in
   capacity-building approaches. The aim of this study was to identify
   characteristics of the design and implementation of current research
   training for rural health professionals in Victoria, Australia, to
   inform a future model for rural health professional research capacity
   and capability building.MethodsA qualitative descriptive study was
   undertaken. Key informants, with extensive knowledge of research
   education and training in rural health services in Victoria, were
   invited to participate in semi-structured telephone interviews via
   snowballing recruitment methods. Interview transcripts were analysed
   inductively, with themes and codes mapped to the domains of the
   Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research.ResultsOf the 40 key
   informants approached, 20 agreed to participate including 11 regional
   health service managers, five rural health academics and four university
   managers. Participants suggested that research training varied in
   quality and relevance to rural health professionals. Training costs and
   lack of tailoring to the rural context were key barriers, whereas
   experiential learning and flexible modes of delivery enabled training
   uptake. Health service and government policies, structures, and
   processes both enabled or stifled implementation opportunities, with
   rural health professional networks from different regions offering
   capacity for research training development, and government departmental
   structures hampering training coordination. Tension between research
   activities and clinical practice, and health professional knowledge and
   beliefs, shaped the delivery of training programs. Strategically planned
   and evaluated research training programs and education via co-design
   with rural health professionals and use of research champions were
   strongly recommended by participants.ConclusionsTo optimise research
   training for rural health professionals and increase the quality and
   quantity of relevant rural health research, a systematically planned,
   implemented, and resourced region-wide research training model is
   required.},

Abstract = {Active-based learning techniques provide an effective pedagogical
   strategy to support student learning. This paper describes the
   development of new assessment techniques to evaluate an active-based
   intervention incorporated into a junior-level (third year)
   transportation engineering course. The research team compared the degree
   of change resulting from the learning intervention using a traditional
   single group pretest to posttest design. To capture the level of mastery
   achieved at various categories of physical activity and safety concepts,
   this study also evaluates project-based learning intervention in an
   additional two ways: overall MAstery-Level Achievement (MALA) on various
   categories and total percent of students achieving mastery. The students
   showed significant improvement at the MALA for all four categories of
   concepts for various levels of learning. The example evaluation
   highlights implications for project-based learning related to the demand
   that active commuting imposes on transportation infrastructure. The MALA
   method strengthens the assessment of the project-based learning approach
   by specifically identifying the different levels of mastery achieved for
   various concept categories.},

Title = {Academic Use of Rapid Prototyping in Digitally Controlled Power Factor
   Correctors},

Abstract = {The growing use of power converters connected to the grid motivates
   their study in power electronics courses and the prototype development
   in the degree final project (DFP). However, the practical realization of
   using state-of-the-art components and conversion techniques is complex
   due to the numerous multidisciplinary aspects that students must
   consider in its design and development and the workload associated with
   the DFP. An example of this is that, unlike a conventional power factor
   correction (PFC) design, the individual dedication of students to
   complete the design and validation of modern bridgeless PFC stages
   exceeds the number of credits of the DFP. The reason for this is that it
   includes system modeling, becoming familiar with the devices used,
   discrete selection, circuit design, control development, and
   programming, to build the converter and verify the operation of the
   complete system. To reinforce the individual skills needed for the DFP
   and reduce this time, a novel strategy is proposed. It allows the
   student to focus their efforts on integrating the individual skills
   achieved in the degree at the appropriate competence level during the
   modeling and construction of the power converter while carrying out part
   of the tasks out of the lab, if necessary, as was the case during the
   pandemic restrictions. For this, the rapid prototyping technique is
   introduced to speed up the overall design and speed up the tuning of
   digital controllers. This manuscript presents a teaching experience in
   which students build digitally controlled power converters using Texas
   Instruments microcontroller boards and PLECS (R). The example of a
   bridgeless totem-pole power factor corrector is shown. Although it began
   to develop and was motivated due to the restrictions during the COVID-19
   pandemic, the experience has been verified and is maintained over time,
   successfully consolidating.},

Abstract = {Introduction Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
   and STEAM (with A for Arts) have evolved to symbolize the renewal of
   science education. STEAM education offers a number of benefits, such as
   improved problem analysis and solving skills, as well as the development
   of creative abilities. Many researchers reiterate the importance of
   STEAM-related activities and programs, especially the integration of
   maker education. Despite much interest in STEAM, it is often challenging
   for many educators to incorporate integrated activities into their
   teaching practice. This paper deals with the value of STEAM integration
   in a methodological sense, with a focus on the maker's laboratory and
   physical computing, as well as the application of design thinking and
   computational thinking approaches. Motivation and Objectives The goal of
   this study is to develop a comprehensive conceptual framework for
   integrated STEM curricula focusing on the following research questions:
   (a) how to improve daily activities of STEM education by combining the
   activities of different laboratories and using a design thinking
   approach? and (b) how to combine FabLab activities and physical
   computing related to teaching different aspects of computational
   thinking in the context of STEM? Research Methodology and Methods As a
   research methodology, we implement a mixed methods strategy to combine
   theoretical study and empirical research based on a synthesized
   literature survey and the process of iterative model development based
   on an observational case study. We conduct a detailed case study of two
   applications of integrated activities based on FabLab and physical
   computing integration, and illustrate how design thinking can guide
   teachers to open up for interdisciplinary, creative, and project-based
   opportunities. Results and Findings The paper provides a conceptual
   framework for STEM integration activities and step-by-step guidelines on
   how design thinking methods could could interact in practice. The
   implications of the results may be useful for educators seeking
   recommendations for the integration process, which enable educators to
   design hands-on activities and incorporate integrated aspect of
   students' STEAM learning into teaching practice. Inconclusions, the
   authors suggest that as interdisciplinary crossroads, design thinking
   provides a natural bridge between subjects, and fits especially to
   integrate activities of the maker's labs and physical computing,
   focusing on the integration of computational thinking and computational
   making approaches within STEM education environment. The absence of a
   statistical evaluation, which is positioned as a further research step,
   may be mentioned as alimitationof the study.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To date, education about health equity for early-stage
   healthcare trainees is largely situated outside of surgical disciplines.
   This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a surgical equity
   curriculum offered to a voluntary group of medical and graduate
   students.
   DESIGN: Mixed-methods cohort study from January to June 2021. Pre-and
   post-course surveys measured domains of attitudes, self-reported
   confidence, and knowledge via 5-point Likert scale and multiple-choice
   questions. Paired t tests were used to analyze quantitative responses.
   Qualitative responses were studied via iterative thematic analysis.
   SETTING: At the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA which
   provides tertiary level, institutional care, 10, interdisciplinary
   1.5-hour sessions were held over 1 semester, teaching surgical equity
   topics that spanned the peri-operative continuum.
   PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four medical and graduate students from across the
   University of Pennsylvania enrolled. Twenty completed both surveys.
   RESULTS: From pre-to post-course, students improved across all domains.
   Students improved in their self-rated ability to identify strategies to
   talk about sensitive health topics with patients (pre: 20\%, post: 90\%)
   and identify strategies to address healthcare disparities in surgery
   (pre: 10\%, post: 90\%). Qualitatively, from pre-to post-course, more
   students could articulate the role of bias and identify opportunities
   for surgeons to engage in surgical equity. The course strengthened any
   pre-existing interest in surgical equity, and for 1 student, created
   interest in a surgical career where it had not previously existed. Many
   also expressed greater resolve to provide patient-centric care.
   CONCLUSIONS: Formal curricula can improve students' ability to advocate
   for surgical equity. A similar framework may fill a need for medical
   students interested in health equity and surgical careers at other
   institutions. (J Surg Ed 80:528-536. (c) 2022 Association of Program

Title = {GSA-Fuzz: Optimize Seed Mutation with Gravitational Search Algorithm},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Mutation-based fuzzing is currently one of the most effective techniques
   to discover software vulnerabilities. It relies on mutation strategies
   to generate interesting seeds. As a state-of-the-art mutation-based
   fuzzer, AFL follows a mutation strategy with high randomization, which
   uses randomly selected mutation operators to mutate seeds at random
   offsets. Its strategy may ignore some efficient mutation operators and
   mutation positions.,erefore, in this paper, we propose a solution named
   GSA-Fuzz to improve the efficiency of seed mutation strategy with the
   gravitational search algorithm (GSA). GSA-Fuzz uses GSA to learn the
   optimal selection probability distributions of operators and mutation
   positions and designs a position-sensitive strategy to guide seed
   mutation with learned distributions. Besides, GSA-Fuzz also provides a
   flip mode to calculate the efficiencies of the deterministic stage and
   indeterministic stage and implements switching between the two stages to
   further improve the efficiency of seed mutation. We compare GSA-Fuzz
   with the state-of-the-art fuzzers AFL, MOPT-AFL, and EcoFuzz on 10
   open-source programs. GSA-Fuzz finds 145\% more paths than AFL, 66\%
   more paths than EcoFuzz, and 43\% more paths than MOPT-AFL. In addition,
   GSA-Fuzz also outperforms other fuzzers in bug detection and line
   coverage.},

Title = {The development of a training course for clubfoot treatment in Africa:
   learning points for course development},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUL 13},
Abstract = {Background: Clubfoot is a common congenital musculoskeletal disorder
   that causes mobility impairment. There is a lack of trained mid-level
   personnel to provide clubfoot treatment in Africa and there is no
   standard training course. This prospective study describes the
   collaborative and participatory approach to the development of a
   training course for the treatment of clubfoot in children in resource
   constrained settings.
   Methods: We used a systems approach to evaluate the development of the
   training course. Inputs: The research strategy included a review of
   context and available training materials, and the collection of data on
   current training practices. Semi-structured interviews were conducted
   with seven expert clubfoot trainers. A survey of 32 international and
   regional trainers was undertaken to inform practical issues. The data
   were used to develop a framework for training with advice from two
   technical groups, consisting of regional and international stakeholders
   and experts.
   Process: A consensus approach was undertaken during workshops, meetings
   and the sharing of documents. The design process for the training
   materials took twenty-four months and was iterative. The training
   materials were piloted nine times between September 2015 and February
   2017. Processes and materials were reviewed and adapted according to
   feedback after each pilot.
   Results: Fifty-one regional trainers from Africa (18 countries), 21
   international experts (11 countries), 113 local providers of clubfoot
   treatment (Ethiopia, Rwanda and Kenya) and local organising teams were
   involved in developing the curriculum and pilot testing. The diversity
   of the two technical advisory groups allowed a wide range of
   contributions to the collaboration. Output: The resulting curriculum and
   content comprised a two day basic training and a two day advanced
   course. The basic course utilised adult learning techniques for training
   novice providers in the treatment of idiopathic clubfoot in children
   under two years old. The advanced course builds on these principles.
   Conclusion: Formative research that included mixed methods (both
   qualitative and quantitative) was important in the development of an
   appropriate training course. The process documentation from this study
   provides useful information to assist planning of medical training
   programmes and may serve as a model for the development of other
   courses.},

Abstract = {Although rhetoric abounds about the importance of patient-, person- and
   relationship-centered approaches to health care, little is known about
   how to address the problem of dehumanization through medical and health
   professions education. One promising but under-theorized strategy is to
   co-produce education in collaboration with health service users. To this
   end, we co-produced a longitudinal course in psychiatry that paired
   people with lived experience of mental health challenges as advisors to
   fourth-year psychiatry residents at the University of Toronto. The goal
   of this study was to examine this novel, relationship-based course in
   order to understand co-produced health professions education more
   broadly. Using qualitative interviews with residents and advisors after
   the first iteration of the course, we explored how participants made
   meaning of the course and of what learning, if any, occurred, for whom
   and how. We found that the anthropological theory of liminality allowed
   us to understand participants' complex experiences and illuminated how
   this type of pedagogy may work to achieve its effects. Liminality also
   helped us understand why some participants resisted the course, and how
   we could more carefully think about co-produced, humanistic education
   and transformative learning.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop an anatomy clinical correlations module utilizing
   modern instructional design techniques and theoretically structured
   student feedback for course improvements.
   DESIGN: A pre-experimental, single group post-test study. Eleven module
   sessions were structured using the 5-E instructional strategy (engage,
   explore, explain, elaborate, and evaluate). Learning impact was measured
   using Keller's ARCS framework (attention, relevance, confidence, and
   satisfaction) and narrative student feed-back was collected to inform
   case alterations. The course was repeated the following year with the
   inte-grated feedback and year-on-year comparisons were drawn.
   SETTING: Single-institution study at the University of Central Florida
   College of Medicine.
   PARTICIPANTS: Medical students currently enrolled in the first-year
   anatomy course.
   RESULTS: Year-on-year comparisons for AY18-19 (n = 78) and AY19-20 (n =
   118) yielded statistically signif-icant improvements in attention
   (4.69-4.76, p = 0.01) and relevance (4.54 to 4.75, p < 0.001) with high
   total combined survey response rates (n = 196/238, 82.4\%). Internal
   consistency was good for attention and strong for the following scales:
   total scale, relevance, confi-dence, and satisfaction. Narrative
   feedback referenced the importance of applied anatomy, clinical context
   and decision-making, the format of the sessions.
   CONCLUSIONS: We structured a series of anatomic clinical correlations
   using an evidence-based instructional strategy, assessed its impact, and
   improved on the course to optimize the motivation to learn anatomy.
   Systematic use of structured student feedback is important to ensure
   case difficulty is within the zone of proximal development. (C) 2021

Abstract = {When COVID-19 shuttered Michigan schools, 52 elementary and middle
   schools statewide were in various stages of implementation of
   comprehensive health programs, including the integration of physical
   activity, physical education, and nutrition education. To support the
   transition to a virtual learning environment, \#HealthyKidsQuarantined
   was launched, providing virtual physical activity, physical education,
   and nutrition education curriculum and resources. Content was
   distributed weekly via e-mail to teachers and families alongside a daily
   social media campaign that disseminated resources to a national
   audience. Results identified significant content usage by schools
   (21,300 views/downloads) and engagement through social media (9,800
   views/downloads). Teachers, students, and families expressed value in
   the health content provided, stating it was a support needed in a time
   of chaos. This study suggests that providing virtual health content may
   be a feasible way to sustain school and family investment in
   comprehensive youth health. Furthermore, by utilizing multiple
   dissemination strategies, virtual programming may be an effective
   mechanism to expand reach.},

Abstract = {Background: Role modeling has been highlighted as an important teaching
   and learning strategy. The aim of this research study was to explore the
   influences and impact of positive doctor role modelling in twenty-first
   century medical education.Methods: This study was part of a larger study
   investigating the process of positive doctor role modeling in medical
   education. This study used focus group interviews with 52 medical
   students, semi-structured interviews with 25 consultants and interviews
   after clinics with five consultants and five medical students. A
   qualitative methodology using the grounded theory approach of Strauss
   and Corbin was then used to explore the impact of modeling in medical
   education.Results: Three main outcomes of role modeling were identified
   - the development of professional behaviors, the development of
   professional identity, and the shaping of career aspirations.Conclusion:
   This study illustrates the powerful, often subconscious impact of doctor
   role modeling in medical education. This research illustrates that role
   models are critically important in the professional development,
   character development, and career development of the modelees. In this
   way, role modeling effectively enhances the transformation of the
   student to a doctor.},

Title = {Design and Implementation of SDN-Based Underwater Acoustic Sensor
   Networks With Multi-Controllers},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {25698-25714},
Abstract = {Underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) provide new opportunities
   for exploring oceans and consequently improving our understanding of the
   underwater world. UASNs usually rely on hardware infrastructure with
   poor flexibility and versatility. Compared with wireless sensor
   networks, UASNs are quite expensive to manufacture and deploy. Due to
   the unique data format, protocols, and service constraints of various
   applications, UASNs are typically deployed in a redundant manner, which
   not only leads to waste but also causes serious interference due to the
   presence of multiple signals in the same underwater region.
   Software-defined networking (SDN) provides an innovative means of
   improving the flexibility of underwater systems. In this paper, we
   present an SDN-based UASN framework, followed by the design of a
   clustering method in which learning automata and degree-constrained
   connected dominating sets are employed. We then propose a load balancing
   mechanism involving multiple controllers, based on the consistent
   hashing algorithm. Finally, we describe a simulation program (called
   UASNs hypervisor) that we developed and implemented to assess the
   network survival time, bit-error rate, and computational complexity. The
   experimental results show that the UASN was improved significantly. This
   work provides important theoretical and technical support for the
   implementation of SDN-based UASNs.},

Abstract = {The study describes a preliminary stage of the decision support system
   development for physician performing neuro-electrostimulation of neck
   neural formations for patients suffering from cardiovascular system
   disorders. The arterial hypertension was used as the clinical model of
   the disorders. The study consisted of two steps: diagnosing of the
   arterial hypertension and an evaluation of the treatment efficiency
   during the neuro-electrostimulation application. For the diagnosing
   part, a clinical study was conducted involving heart rate variability
   signals recorded while performing tilt-test functional load. Heart rate
   variability signal is an indirect mean of accessing autonomic nervous
   system functioning. Disturbances of the autonomic nervous system are
   essential in pathology of arterial hypertension. Performance of
   different machine learning techniques and feature selection strategies
   in task of binary classification (healthy volunteers and patients
   suffering from arterial hypertension) were compared. The genetic
   programming feature selection and quadratic discriminant analysis
   classifier reached the highest classification accuracy. Best feature
   combinations were used to evaluate treatment efficiency. Predictions
   based on the selected heart rate variability features have a high level
   of agreement with the arterial pressure dynamics. The results indicate
   the potential of the proposed decision support system. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Abstract = {Early research experiences must be made available to all undergraduate
   students, including those at 2-yr institutions who account for nearly
   half of America's college students. We report on barriers unique to 2-yr
   institutions that preclude the success of an early course-based
   undergraduate research experience (CURE). Using a randomized study
   design, we evaluated a CURE in equivalent introductory biology courses
   at a 4-yr institution and a 2-yr institution within the same geographic
   region. We found that these student populations developed dramatically
   different impressions of the experience. Students at the 4-yr
   institution enjoyed the CURE significantly more than the traditional
   labs. However, students at the 2-yr institution enjoyed the traditional
   labs significantly more, even though the CURE successfully produced
   targeted learning gains. On the basis of course evaluations, we enhanced
   instructor, student, and support staff training and reevaluated this
   CURE at a different campus of the same 2-yr institution. This time, the
   students reported that they enjoyed the research experience
   significantly more than the traditional labs. We conclude that early
   research experiences can succeed at 2-yr institutions, provided that a
   comprehensive implementation strategy targeting instructor, student, and
   support staff training is in place.},

Title = {Keyword-guided abstractive code summarization via incorporating
   structural and contextual information},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {150},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Context: Source code summarization is a crucial yet far from settled
   task for describing structured code snippets in natural language.
   High-quality code summaries could effectively facilitate program
   comprehension and software maintenance. A good code summary is supposed
   to have the following characteristics: complete information, correct
   meaning, and consistent description. In recent years, numerous
   approaches have been proposed for code summarization, but it is still
   very challenging for developers to automatically learn the complex
   semantics from the source code and generate complete, correct and
   consistent code summaries.
   Objective: In this paper, we propose KGCodeSum, a novel keyword-guided
   abstractive code summarization approach that incorporates structural and
   contextual information.
   Methods: To improve summaries' quality, we leverage both the structural
   information embedded in code itself and the contextual information from
   related code snippets. Meanwhile, we make use of keywords to guide
   summaries' generation to guarantee the code summaries contain key
   information. Finally, we propose a new dynamic vocabulary strategy which
   can effectively resolve the UNK problems in code summaries.
   Results: Through our evaluation on the large-scale benchmark datasets
   with 2.1 million java method-comment pairs and 1.1 million C/C++
   function-summary pairs, We have observed that our approach could
   generate better code summaries than existing state-of-the-art approaches
   in terms of completeness, correctness and consistency. In addition, we
   also find that incorporating the dynamic vocabulary strategy into our
   approach could significantly save time and space in the model training
   process.
   Conclusion: Our KGCodeSum approach could effectively generate code
   summaries.},

Title = {Challenges in user-driven optimization of EHR: A case study of a large
   Epic implementation in Denmark},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {148},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: Research suggests that capturing the benefits of electronic
   health records (EHR) requires systematic and ongoing optimization of
   technology configuration and use after implementation. However, little
   is known about EHR optimization in a hospital context.
   Objective: To explore the issues and challenges involved in organizing
   and managing a systematic user-driven EHR optimization program.
   Methods: A longitudinal case study of an EHR optimization program
   launched in two large Danish hospital systems was undertaken. It
   involved interviewing 28 key managers, clinicians and IT staff,
   participating in formal and informal meetings, and reviewing policy
   documents, meeting minutes, teaching materials and other relevant
   documents.
   Findings: The two hospital systems are struggling to find the best way
   to organize and manage the optimization program. So far, the program has
   been a mixed success. Involving clinicians in EHR optimization poses
   serious dilemmas for hospital managers, who must manage two related
   tensions: between standardization and adaptation, and between
   centralized control and local autonomy.
   Conclusion: The findings highlight the significant challenges in
   designing a successful EHR optimization program and underscore the
   importance of developing more sophisticated strategies for clinical
   standardization and innovation.},

Abstract = {It is a non-trivial task for research-centric courses in the software
   engineering curriculum to compete and engage students on the same level
   as the practical, software development courses. Practical software
   development courses and projects are inherently motivating to students,
   as they provide necessary elements such as agency, relatedness, and the
   strong sense of competence upon completing software engineering tasks.
   In contrast, reading research articles and technical white papers feels
   dry and non-engaging. Nevertheless, a well-balanced MSc programme
   curriculum covers both, learning through construction and practical
   courses as well as research courses. The main motivation for the
   development of game-centric approaches to the research aspects of
   curriculum is to improve students' interest and engagement with those
   courses. In this paper, we present the methodology and initial
   evaluations from three gamification strategies used in the Master's
   degree programme. These are: the game of reading and discussing research
   articles (GoRaD), the game of arguing and counter-arguing, and combining
   research and practice. The paper presents our experimentation and
   initial evaluations of the use of those strategies, as well as plans for
   future development and enhancements.},

Journal = {R JOURNAL},

Volume = {10},
Number = {2},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Learning classification tasks in which each instance is associated with
   one or more labels are known as multi-label learning. The implementation
   of multi-label algorithms, performed by different researchers, have
   several specificities, like input/output format, different internal
   functions, distinct programming language, to mention just some of them.
   As a result, current machine learning tools include only a small subset
   of multi-label decomposition strategies. The utiml package is a
   framework for the application of classification algorithms to
   multi-label data. Like the well known MULAN used with Weka, it provides
   a set of multi-label procedures such as sampling methods, transformation
   strategies, threshold functions, pre-processing techniques and
   evaluation metrics. The package was designed to allow users to easily
   perform complete multi-label classification experiments in the R
   environment. This paper describes the utiml API and illustrates its use
   in different multi-label classification scenarios.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Stress occurs in surgeons with a significantly higher
   prevalence than in the general population. At the same time, learning of
   coping techniques and improving personal skills how to handle the daily
   workload are not integral parts of the medical education or during
   adjustment to the job as a surgeon. In this pilot study, we developed a
   training course to teach different stress management and coping
   techniques and analyzed individual conditions of the surgeons before and
   after the course.
   METHODS: In total, 68 junior surgeons in their first year at work
   participated in the training and were randomized in an intervention (n =
   35) or a control group (n = 33). At the beginning and the end of the
   training, the intervention and the comparison group answered a
   standardized, validated questionnaire on job satisfaction, perceived
   stress, and personal skills (such as self-efficacy).
   RESULTS: The surgeons showed a significant decline in perceived stress.
   Furthermore, they showed an improvement in self-reported resilience and
   self-efficacy. Job satisfaction increased at the same time. The
   comparison cohort of surgeons showed comparable scores for the specified
   outcome variables at the beginning but showed no progressive changes
   during time.
   CONCLUSIONS: The study findings indicate that the training for junior
   surgeons in their first year at work is suitable to implement as a group
   training program. Moreover, the training provides statistically
   significant improvement in perceptions of distress and strengthens
   individual protective factors and job satisfaction. ((C) 2015

Title = {Communication skills training using virtual reality: A descriptive
   qualitative study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {94},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Modern medical pedagogical strategies are shifting toward
   the use of virtual patient simulations.
   Objective: This study aims to examine students' users' attitudes and
   experiences and clinical facilitators' perspectives on student
   performances in the clinical setting post-virtual patient training.
   Design: A descriptive qualitative study design was used.
   Setting: Nursing faculty at a local university in Singapore.
   Participants: 24 nursing undergraduates and six clinical facilitators.
   Methods: This study is a follow-up of an experimental study on the
   Virtual Counseling Application Using Artificial Intelligence (VCAAI).
   The study took place from the academic year 2017/2018 ended in November
   2019. Focus group discussions and individual interviews were conducted.
   All interviews and focus group discussions were audiotaped, transcribed
   verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis.
   Results: Two overarching themes (students' virtual patient user
   experience and clinical facilitators' evaluations of students' clinical
   communication skills) comprising six themes were generated. Themes under
   students' user experience included: 1) attitudes toward virtual patient
   training, 2) virtual patient's role in student development, and 3)
   enhanced features and implementation suggestions. Themes under clinical
   facilitators' evaluations included: 1) insights on students'
   communication skills and 2) approaches to improve communication skills.
   An overlapping theme titled `value of technology in teaching
   communication' comprised of mutual feedback from both students and
   clinical facilitators. Early implementation, continued accessibility,
   enhancing realism and technological improvements to the VCAAI were
   listed as key areas for program improvement, while increased situational
   sensitivity and language training are recommended to further enhance
   students' communication skills.
   Conclusion: The mixed attitudes toward virtual patient interactions and
   recognitions of the benefits of virtual patient simulations suggest the
   potential effectiveness of the use of virtual patients in teaching
   effective nursing communication skills. However, the lack of
   authenticity and other limitations need to be addressed before official
   implementations of such trainings with virtual patients to undergraduate
   nursing curricula.},

Title = {Specific entrustable professional activities for undergraduate medical
   internships: a method compatible with the academic curriculum},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {Background: Competency-based education has been considered the most
   important pedagogical trend in Medicine in the last two decades. In
   clinical contexts, competencies are implemented through Entrustable
   Professional Activities (EPAs) which are observable and measurable. The
   aim of this paper is to describe the methodology used in the design of
   educational tools to assess students' competencies in clinical practice
   during their undergraduate internship (UI). In this paper, we present
   the construction of specific APROCs (Actividades Profesionales
   Confiables) in Surgery (S), Gynecology and Obstetrics (GO) and Family
   Medicine (FM) rotations with three levels of performance.
   Methods: The study considered a mixed method exploratory type design, a
   qualitative phase followed by a quantitative validation exercise. In the
   first stage data was obtained from three rotations (FM, GO and S)
   through focus groups about real and expected activities of medical
   interns. Triangulation with other sources was made to construct
   benchmarks. In the second stage, narrative descriptions with the three
   levels were validated by professors who teach the different subjects
   using the Delphi technique.
   Results: The results may be described both curricular and methodological
   wise. From the curricular point of view, APROCs were identified in three
   UI rotations within clinical contexts in Mexico City, benchmarks were
   developed by levels and validated by experts' consensus. In regard to
   methodological issues, this research contributed to the development of a
   strategy, following six steps, to build APROCs using mixed methods.
   Conclusions: Developing benchmarks provides a regular and standardized
   language that helps to evaluate student's performance and define
   educational strategies efficiently and accurately. The university
   academic program was aligned with APROCs in clinical contexts to assure
   the acquisition of competencies by students.},

Abstract = {Following the massive 7.0-magnitude earthquake that devastated much of
   the Haitian capital city of Port-au-Prince on January 12, 2010, the
   Haitian health system and its medical education programs were
   fragmented, fragile, and facing a significant, overwhelming demand for
   clinical care. In response, the authors of this paper and the
   institutions they represent supported the development of a teaching
   hospital that could fill the void in academic training capacity while
   prioritizing the health of Haiti's rural poor-goals aligned with the
   Haitian Ministry of Health (MOH) strategy. This bold initiative aimed to
   address both the immediate and long-term health care needs within
   post-disaster Haiti through a strategic investment in graduate medical
   education (GME). Here, the authors describe their approach, which
   included building consensus, aspiring to international standards, and
   investing in shared governance structures under Haitian leadership. The
   Haitian MOH strategy and priorities guided the development,
   implementation, and expansion of solutions to the ongoing crisis in
   human resources for health within the acute context. Local leadership of
   this initiative ensured a sustained and transformative model of GME that
   has carried Haiti beyond acute relief and toward a more reliable health
   system. The enduring success can be measured through sustained
   governance systems, graduates who have remained in Haiti, standardized
   curricula, a culture of continuous improvement, and the historic
   achievement of international accreditation. While ongoing challenges
   persist, Haiti has demonstrated that the strategy of investing in GME in
   response to acute disasters should be considered in other global
   settings to support the revitalization of tenuous health systems.},

Title = {The Optimization of Civic Education with the Assistance of Artificial
   Intelligence Devices},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {SEP 21},
Abstract = {With the advent of the era of artificial intelligence, a technological
   revolution has begun in the field of education, which has injected new
   momentum into moral education. Today, civic education is developing
   rapidly in countries around the world, while civic education in China is
   still relatively lagging behind. In China, we need to optimize civic
   education by building a comprehensive civic education system,
   implementing the concept of people-oriented, gathering the joint efforts
   of the whole society, expanding diversified civic education methods, and
   selecting and enriching the contents of civic education. Artificial
   intelligence technology enables higher education institutions to carry
   out civic education, enrich teaching contents, broaden teaching methods,
   and optimize teaching evaluation. However, technology-related
   innovations are dualistic in nature, with essential, technical, and
   value risks that hinder their effectiveness in civic education. This
   paper proposes strategies for optimization in terms of improving digital
   core risk response capabilities, establishing reliable technology risk
   response mechanisms, and maintaining a foundation for civic education
   response costs. Thus, weakening the risk factors of AI in civic
   education facilitates the transformation of AI and technology to the
   advantage of knowledge-based civic education. This paper discusses
   strategies and methods for optimizing smart education using AI devices
   and establishes a corresponding smart education platform to help
   students with their ideological education. Based on the analysis of
   actual cases, the paper discusses the effectiveness and advantages of
   the program.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {83},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1732-1741},
Abstract = {Objective. To implement a continuous professional development (CPD)
   program in the didactic curriculum of a three-year Doctor of Pharmacy
   (PharmD) program, and evaluate associated outcomes.
   Methods. The initial CPD program was implemented in the didactic
   curriculum of the PharmD program in 2014-2015. Barriers were identified
   and strategies adopted to overcome the barriers. A revised CPD
   curriculum was implemented in the 2015-2016 academic year. Student and
   faculty evaluations of the course were conducted, and students'
   perceived capabilities in the various skills related to professional
   development were measured.
   Results. The student ratings of the course were acceptable (ranging from
   3.3 to 4.2 on a 5-point Likert scale). First-year students rated the
   course higher than second-year students did. The majority of faculty
   members found the CPD curriculum valuable for students. Students
   perceived that their skills in oral, written and interprofessional
   communication, leadership, and time management had significantly
   improved after completing the course.
   Conclusion. Implementation of a CPD process during the didactic
   curriculum for PharmD students is feasible and beneficial to students'
   professional development. This CPD model provided students with an
   opportunity to develop self-directed lifelong learning skills and
   prepared them to transition to practice-based learning in their final
   year of the program.},

Title = {In the shadow of the ivory tower: Experiences of midwives and nurses
   undertaking PhDs},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {65},
Pages = {36-40},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Aims: The aims of this study were to gain an understanding of the
   experiences of nurses and midwives enrolled in a PhD, explore any
   barriers that PhD students encounter whilst completing the degree, and
   develop recommendations for consideration in formulating support
   strategies to encourage completion for nurses and midwives enrolled on a
   PhD degree.
   Background: It is important to understand what is happening at doctoral
   level education for nurses and midwives, and how those enrolled on PhD
   courses can successfully complete their studies, transition learning,
   and acquire the ability to undertake research into the clinical
   environments.
   Design: The criteria for inclusion into the study was that participants
   were either a Registered Nurse or Registered Midwife enrolled in a PhD
   degree.
   Methods: A mixed methodology, non-experimental design approach was used
   with purposive sampling in an anonymous survey, that included both
   qualitative and quantitative questions to collect data in 2017.
   Findings: Supervisors and supervision were the focus of the
   participant's responses, and issues were identified in negotiating the
   right supervisors for nurse/midwife PhD students. PhD students would
   benefit from specific teaching and the opportunity to discuss issues
   that occur as part of the PhD process.
   Conclusion: Academia needs to consider new approaches to more
   effectively integrate teaching time into supervision, thereby optimising
   PhD completion for nursing and midwifery PhD students.},

Title = {A Compressive Receding Horizon Approach for Smart Home Energy Management},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {100407-100435},
Abstract = {Current increases in the demand for electricity require sustainable
   energy management measures and have promoted the adoption of clean and
   renewable sources, particularly at the residential building level.
   Active demand management is usually carried out through load shifting
   based on specific techniques, such as optimisation, heuristics,
   model-based predictive control and machine learning methodologies. This
   work addresses the problem of residential load scheduling via
   optimisation techniques. A compressive receding horizon strategy is
   proposed for week-ahead load shifting, and the selection is driven by
   traditional receding horizon and day-ahead allocation strategy
   misalignment, with weekly household appliance usage patterns. The
   proposed approach is compared with receding horizon and day-ahead
   scheduling techniques over 30 different weeks for a prototypical smart
   home with non-controllable demand, which is representative of a
   four-resident family and includes micro power generation and battery
   storage. The simulation results confirm the validity of the proposed
   strategy in the context of household appliance scheduling problems and
   show competitive electricity costs and resident discomfort performance
   compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, the proposed
   compressive receding horizon strategy fully exploits weather and
   photovoltaic generation forecasts to promote self-consumption and grid
   demand stress reduction while providing environmental gains and
   financial benefits to the utility service and consumers, particularly in
   the case of simultaneously scheduling a huge number of households.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND The closure of schools in response to COVID-19 compromised
   access to essential meals for many students. The Emergency Meals-to-You
   program, a public/private partnership, was set up to address this
   challenge. More than 38.7 million meals were delivered between April and
   August 2020. This study explores lessons learned and identifies
   strategies for strengthening food access and security at schools and
   beyond. METHODS Qualitative research methods were used. This included
   interviews and focus groups with participants involved in setting up and
   delivering the Emergency Meals-to-You program. Data were thematically
   analyzed using key phrases, ideas, and concepts, and interpreted.
   RESULTS The program leveraged a multisectoral approach. Components
   relied on each other and included: schools, public/private partnership,
   eligibility, relationships, experience, centralized communication, food
   quality and branding, logistics, and transport. Strategies identified to
   strengthen food access focused on integration with emergency management
   structures, understanding food needs at the school level, building a
   fully procurable menu, and allowing distribution to be rapidly scaled.
   CONCLUSIONS The lessons identified and strategies recommended provide a
   framework for working across the emergency management spectrum (school
   to national level) to strengthen food access and availability for
   students and their families affected by a pandemic, disaster, or crisis
   situation.},

Abstract = {For many years, the U.S. has underutilized its human resources, as
   evidenced by the pervasive underrepresentation of several racial and
   ethnic groups within academia in general and the science, technology,
   engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, in particular. To
   address this underutilization, academic departments within U.S.
   universities must develop grassroots efforts that both recruit and
   retain students from all segments of the U.S. population. While many
   departments have noted this need and are earnestly trying to increase
   the diversity of their programs, very few have successfully achieved
   this laudable goal. This inquiry into the salient features of successful
   diversity agendas within STEM academic departments provides key insights
   into how departments can increase and sustain the doctoral degree
   attainment of students from underrepresented racial and ethnic minority
   groups.},

Abstract = {A microcontroller-based system is used to illustrate experimental
   concepts in a Control Systems course in an Electrical Engineering
   Technology program. Students are able to experiment with different
   control strategies ranging from an open-loop to PID control. Students
   are asked to reason and discuss the benefits and drawbacks associated
   with each strategy. The microcontroller system has been chosen to
   minimize the learning curve for the students in such a way that they are
   mostly concerned with acquiring and representing the appropriate signals
   from the system as well as experimenting with changing the parameters of
   the system in each case.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this longitudinal study was to explore the development of
   pre-service chemistry teachers' pedagogical content knowledge regarding
   the effect of temperature on reaction rate topic as they took
   pedagogical content knowledge courses throughout the teacher education
   program. Pre-service teachers' pedagogical content knowledge was
   examined under five components: Orientations toward science teaching,
   Knowledge of curriculum, Knowledge of instructional strategies,
   Knowledge of learners, and Knowledge of assessment. Two pre-service
   chemistry teachers participated in the study. Data were collected
   through a vignette and semi-structured interviews over two years.
   Analysis of data revealed that both participants' pedagogical content
   knowledge components showed development. However, there was an uneven
   development of components of pedagogical content knowledge. Moreover,
   the degree and pattern of development were different for some components
   of pedagogical content knowledge for each participant. The present study
   has some implications for teacher educators and teacher education
   programs.},

Abstract = {Effective and equitable CS teaching is contingent on teachers' robust
   understanding of equity issues in CS classrooms. To this end, this study
   examined high school teachers' perceptions of equity during their
   participation in a CS teacher certificate program over two years. The
   participants are from various disciplines and from schools that serve
   under-represented students. Using a qualitative approach, we conducted
   content analysis of the teachers' written reflections and responses to
   semi-structured interviews. Based on the justice-centered framework, we
   analyzed the major themes that emerged from the content analysis. The
   findings provide insights into high school CS teachers' understanding of
   equity, the strategies that teachers use to address equity issues, and
   how teachers interpret the causes of inequities in CS classrooms. This
   research presents frameworks for examining teachers' conceptualizations
   of equity and can inform the implementation of future professional
   development programs for CS teachers.},

Abstract = {Background: To date there have been no randomized studies that assess
   whether Spirituality and Health (S/H) programs are, indeed, effective,
   or not. We sought to evaluate if an intervention in teaching S/H fosters
   competence changes in healthcare students.Methods: A randomized
   controlled trial was carried out. Students were randomized into two
   groups: an Intervention Group (a theoretical-practical course in S/H)
   and a control group (waiting list). Students' S/H knowledge, attitudes,
   and skills (through a simulated patient) were assessed.Results: A total
   of 49 students were evaluated. Students in the intervention group
   received higher scores on knowledge tests, felt more comfortable and
   prepared to talk about religious/spiritual beliefs with patients, more
   readily recognized importance of hospital chaplains, and more frequently
   held the opinion that addressing spirituality is important. Furthermore,
   a breaking down of S/H barriers was identified. Students also
   demonstrated more ability in obtaining a patient's spiritual history
   when compared to the control group.Conclusions: There were some
   differences on knowledge, attitudes, and spiritual history skills
   between students who participated in the S/H teaching strategy and
   students who have not been exposed to the theme. These results might
   foster discussion for the development of new educational strategies
   about the subject.},

Title = {A realist synthesis of effective continuing professional development
   (CPD): A case study of healthcare practitioners' CPD},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {69},
Pages = {134-141},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Continuing professional development (CPD) in healthcare is
   fundamental for making sure frontline staff practice safely and
   effectively. This requires practitioners to update knowledge and skills
   regularly to match the changing complexity of healthcare needs. The
   drive towards using limited resources effectively for service
   improvements and the need for a flexible workforce necessitate a review
   of ad hoc approaches to CPD.
   Objective: To develop strategies for achieving effective CPD in
   healthcare.
   Design: A case study design drawing on principles of realist synthesis
   was used during two phases of the study to identify and test what works
   and in what circumstances.
   Setting: One National Health Service Trust in South East England.
   Participants: CPD stakeholders including professional regulatory bodies
   (n = 8), commissioners of healthcare (n = 15), facilitators of clinical
   skills development (n = 34), NHS staff in clinical leadership positions
   (n = 38), NHS staff undertaking skills development post graduate
   programs (n = 31), service user advocates (n = 8) and an international
   expert reference group (ERG) (n = 10).
   Methods: Data sources included a review of scholarly and grey
   literature, an online survey and a consensus workshop. Thematic and
   content analyses were used during data processing.
   Results: The findings present four interdependent transformation
   theories comprising transforming individual practice, skills for the
   changing healthcare contexts, knowledge translation and workplace
   cultures to optimize learning, development and healthcare performance.
   Conclusions: The transformation theories contextualize CPD drivers and
   identify conditions conducive for effective CPD. Practitioner driven CPD
   in healthcare is effective within supportive organizations, facilitated
   workplace learning and effective workplace cultures. Organizations and
   teams with shared values and purpose enable active generation of
   knowledge from practice and the use of different types of knowledge for
   service improvements.},

Title = {Investor preference analysis: An online optimization approach with
   missing information},
Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {633},
Pages = {27-40},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {How to derive an investor's preference is vital for investment advisors
   and online lending platforms for targeted marketing strategies, e.g.,
   market segmentation and financial product recommendation. However,
   investor preference analysis usually depends on judgments from human
   investment experts, which are inherently subjective and costly.
   Intelligent investment advisors (or Robo-advisors), supported by
   cutting-edge technologies such as machine learning and artificial
   intelligence, are established to relieve these pending issues. This
   paper employs an online optimization framework to obtain investors'
   preferences for further financial product recommendations. This proposed
   method allows us to update the investor's preference for newly-arriving
   data sets and tackle the situation where plenty of missing values in
   investors' records are present. Unlike the black-box-like machine
   learning approach, our method can provide more managerial implications
   regarding why one financial product/service is preferred. Real-world
   data set from an online financial platform is used to compare the
   existing approaches and shows the stronger and more stable performance
   of our method when facing different data-missing types and situations
   with different missing degrees, followed by a recommendation system
   application.},

Abstract = {In this study, we propose an algorithm based on a recently proposed
   metaheuristic called the Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO). We utilized a
   dynamic control strategy to enhance the exploration capability. To
   further avoid trapping in local optima, we incorporate opposition-based
   learning (OLB) and a multi-restart strategy. The proposed algorithm is
   used to solve economic load dispatch (ELD) problems with non-smooth cost
   functions. The ELD problems have a very large search space and therefore
   it is difficult to find global optimum using analytical methods. The
   results of the proposed approach are very competitive compared with
   notable results from previous research.},

Abstract = {Recently, there has been a renewed interest in the machine learning
   community for variants of a sparse greedy approximation procedure for
   concave optimization known as the Frank-Wolfe (FW) method. In
   particular, this procedure has been successfully applied to train
   large-scale instances of non-linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
   Specializing FW to SVM training has allowed to obtain efficient
   algorithms, but also important theoretical results, including
   convergence analysis of training algorithms and new characterizations of
   model sparsity.
   In this paper, we present and analyze a novel variant of the FW method
   based on a new way to perform away steps, a classic strategy used to
   accelerate the convergence of the basic FW procedure. Our formulation
   and analysis is focused on a general concave maximization problem on the
   simplex. However, the specialization of our algorithm to quadratic forms
   is strongly related to some classic methods in computational geometry,
   namely the Gilbert and MDM algorithms.
   On the theoretical side, we demonstrate that the method matches the
   guarantees in terms of convergence rate and number of iterations
   obtained by using classic away steps. In particular, the method enjoys a
   linear rate of convergence, a result that has been recently proved for
   MDM on quadratic forms.
   On the practical side, we provide experiments on several classification
   datasets, and evaluate the results using statistical tests. Experiments
   show that our method is faster than the FW method with classic away
   steps, and works well even in the cases in which classic away steps slow
   down the algorithm. Furthermore, these improvements are obtained without
   sacrificing the predictive accuracy of the obtained SVM model. (C) 2014

   Function (VNF) instances need to be scaled out, scaled in, and
   reallocated across the NFV infrastructure (NFVI) to avoid a violation of
   service agreements when the demand traffic changes. However, selecting
   the new placement of VNFs for migrating a service function chain (SFC)
   is an issue of efficient NFV control. We propose two novel integer
   linear programming (ILP) models and two approximation algorithms for SFC
   placement and migration to maximize the cost-efficiency of an NFV
   network regarding the changes of service demands and dynamic routing.
   The ILP models allow us to obtain the optimal solutions of SFC placement
   and migration with explicit dynamic paths. The approximation migration
   results provided by our proposed heuristic and reinforcement learning
   algorithms are close to the optimal solution. Evaluation results carried
   out with real datasets and synthetic network topologies provide a
   helpful suggestion of a migration strategy for an NFV service provider
   to optimize the operating cost of an NFV network in the long term.},

Abstract = {A cancers disease in virtually any of its types presents a significant
   reason behind death surrounding the world. In cancer analysis,
   classification of varied tumor types is of the greatest importance.
   Microarray gene expressions datasets investigation has been seemed to
   provide a successful framework for revising tumor and genetic diseases.
   Despite the fact that standard machine learning ML strategies have
   effectively been valuable to realize significant genes and classify
   category type for new cases, regular limitations of DNA microarray data
   analysis, for example, the small size of an instance, an incredible
   feature number, yet reason for limitation its investigative, medical and
   logical uses. Extending the interpretability of expectation and forecast
   approaches while holding a great precision would help to analysis genes
   expression profiles information in DNA microarray dataset all the most
   reasonable and proficiently. This paper presents a new methodology based
   on the gene expression profiles to classify human cancer diseases. The
   proposed methodology combines both Information Gain (IG) and Standard
   Genetic Algorithm (SGA). It first uses Information Gain for feature
   selection, then uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature reduction and
   finally uses Genetic Programming (GP) for cancer types' classification.
   The suggested system is evaluated by classifying cancer diseases in
   seven cancer datasets and the results are compared with most latest
   approaches. The use of proposed system on cancers datasets matching with
   other machine learning methodologies shows that no classification
   technique commonly outperforms all the others, however, Genetic
   Algorithm improve the classification performance of other classifiers
   generally. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},

Abstract = {Background: Nurses have a key role in the early assessment and
   management of sepsis, which is crucial for optimal quality of care and
   better patient outcomes. However, sepsis in critical care patients is
   underrecognized and untreated due to nurses' poor knowledge, attitudes,
   practice, and decision-making skills related to sepsis assessment and
   management. Objectives: This study aimed to test the effectiveness of
   branching simulations in improving nurses' knowledge, attitudes,
   practices, and decision-making related to sepsis assessment and
   management. Methods: This experimental study was conducted on a
   convenience sample of 70 nurses (35 nurses in each of the intervention
   and control groups) with at least one year of experience working in an
   emergency room at a university hospital. The nurses' knowledge,
   attitudes, and practices were measured using a knowledge, attitudes, and
   practices survey, whilst their decision-making modes were assessed using
   the Nursing Decision-Making Instrument. Results: Compared to the control
   group, a significant improvement in practices (F (1, 68) = 10.77, p =
   0.002, eta 2 = 0.137) and decision-making (F (1, 68) = 10.68, p = 0.002,
   eta 2 = 0.136) was observed among the nurses in the intervention group
   both immediately and two weeks post the branching simulations
   intervention. Compared to the baseline data, a significant improvement
   in knowledge (F (2, 136) = 27.93, p < 0.001, eta 2 = 0.291), practices
   (F (2, 136) = 41.00, p < 0.001, eta 2 = 0.376), and decision-making
   modes (F (2, 136) = 29.15, p < 0.001, eta 2 = 0.300) was observed both
   immediately and two weeks post branching simulations only among the
   nurses in the intervention group. Conclusions: Education programs
   integrated with an interactive strategy of learning (branching
   simulations) can improve nurses' knowledge, attitude, practice, and
   decision-making related to sepsis assessment and management. Therefore,
   continuous education and professional training programs following an
   evidence-based intervention protocol/guideline are recommended for
   better nurse and patient outcomes.},

Abstract = {With an increasing awareness of the disparate impact of COVID-19 on
   historically marginalized populations and acts of violence on Black
   communities in 2020, academic health centers across the United States
   have been prioritizing antiracism strategies. Often, medical students
   and residents have been educated in the concepts of equity and
   antiracism and are ready to tackle these issues in practice. However,
   faculty are not prepared to respond to or integrate antiracism topics
   into the curriculum. Leaders in faculty affairs, education, diversity,
   and other departments are seeking tools, frameworks, expertise, and
   programs that are best suited to meet this imminent faculty development
   need. In response to these demands for guidance, the authors came
   together to explore best practices, common competencies, and frameworks
   related to antiracism education. The focus of their work was preparing
   faculty to foster antiracist learning environments at traditionally
   predominantly White medical schools. In this Scholarly Perspective, the
   authors describe their collaborative work to define racism and
   antiracism education; propose a framework for antiracism education for
   faculty development; and outline key elements to successfully build
   faculty capacity in providing antiracism education. The proposed
   framework highlights the interplay between individual learning and
   growth and the systemic and institutional changes needed to advance
   antiracist policies and practices. The key elements of the framework
   include building foundational awareness, expanding foundational
   knowledge on antiracism, embedding antiracism education into practice,
   and dismantling oppressive structures and measuring progress. The
   authors list considerations for program planning and provide examples of
   current work from their institutions. The proposed strategies aim to
   support all faculty and enable them to learn, work, and educate others
   in an antiracist learning environment.},

Abstract = {A framework for constructing robust classification models is proposed in
   the paper. An assumption about importance of one of the classes in
   comparison with other classes is incorporated into the models. It often
   takes place in the real application, for example, in reliability, in
   medical diagnostic, etc. A main idea underlying the models is to
   consider a set of probability distributions on training examples
   produced by the imprecise probability models such as linear-vacuous
   mixture and constant odd-ratio contaminated models. Extreme points of
   the sets of probability distributions are a main tool for constructing
   the robust classifiers. It is shown that algorithms for computing
   optimal classification parameters are reduced to a finite number of
   weighted support vector machines with weights determined by the extreme
   points. Experimental results with synthetic and real data illustrate the
   proposed models.},

Title = {The effects of debate-based ethics education on the moral sensitivity
   and judgment of nursing students: A quasi-experimental study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {83},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: While ethics education in undergraduate nursing education
   can be developed using a variety of teaching and learning strategies,
   consensus on the content and teaching modules for these ethics courses
   has still not been established and the effect of ethics education has
   rarely been evaluated.
   Objectives: The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of
   debate-based ethics education and lecture-style ethics education on the
   moral sensitivity and moral judgment of nursing students..
   Methods: This was a pre-test and post-test quasi-experimental study with
   a control group. A total of 64 senior-year nursing students in Korea
   participated in the study (35 in the debate group and 29 in the lecture
   group). The debate-based ethics education lasted for eight weeks with
   one two-hour session per week. The debate-based ethics education
   consisted of 16 rounds of affirmative and negative sides. Each debate
   lasted a total of 40 min and consisted of the introduction,
   cross-examination, rebuttal, conclusion, operation time, and wrap-up.
   The outcomes were measured by moral sensitivity and moral judgment
   questionnaires.
   Results: There was a significant improvement in idealistic moral
   judgment and realistic moral judgment in the debate group compared to
   the lecture group. However, no statistically significant difference was
   found for moral sensitivity between the two groups.
   Conclusion: Based on this study's findings, it can be concluded that the
   debate-based ethics education for undergraduate nursing students is very
   effective in promoting moral judgment and the ability to take ethical
   decisions.},

Title = {The development of academic identity in graduate nursing students: An
   interpretive descriptive study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {103},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: Mentorship is an important element in the development of
   academic identity among graduate students in nursing. Although most
   often occurring within the context of faculty advisor-student
   relationships, mentorship should extend beyond formal advisor-advisee
   relationships. Peer mentorship is known to be beneficial for graduate
   students, yet little is known about how peer mentorship specifically
   impacts the development of academic identity.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore how peer mentorship,
   within the context of an international research conference, impacts the
   development of academic identity.
   Design: Qualitative descriptive study. Graduate nursing students from a
   research-intensive university in Canada were invited to participate in a
   peer mentorship initiative. Data were collected through reflective
   journals. Data analysis was conducted iteratively and collaboratively
   using an interpretive descriptive approach.
   Participants: Eight mentees, two peer mentors and five faculty mentors
   participated in the initiative. With the exception of one faculty
   mentor, all participants provided reflective journals on their
   experiences, in response to journal prompts.
   Results: Findings centered on five themes: walking through quicksand,
   navigating a complex academic world, developing academic identity
   through relationships, intentional cultivation of community, and finding
   solid ground. Our findings highlight the relational nature of academic
   identity development, and the significant benefit of providing
   mentorship to graduate nursing students outside of formal learning
   spaces.
   Conclusions: Given the urgent need to increase the numbers of nurses
   with advanced research training, it is important that effective
   strategies like this innovative mentorship initiative, that enhance
   professional identity development, are integrated into graduate
   education programs.},

Title = {Evaluation of a tablet-based instruction of breathing technique in
   patients with COPD},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {94},
Pages = {263-270},

Abstract = {Purpose: Tablet computers are a convenient audio-visual aid for patient
   education. Teaching patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder
   (COPD) appropriate therapeutic breathing techniques and encouraging them
   to practice regularly has been recognized as an effective care strategy.
   The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of using a
   tablet computer with the Breathing Easier Support Toolkit (BEST), a
   supplemental software application we developed that instructs and
   assists COPD patients during the process of respiratory retraining.
   Patients and methods: From May 2013 to September 2014, participants were
   randomly assigned to an experimental group (n = 36) or a control group
   (n = 35). Correct breathing technique, practice frequency, application
   of breathing technique, self-efficacy, quality of life, and patient
   feedback on the tablet computer education were evaluated with blinded
   assessments at baseline and immediate, 1-month, and 3-month follow-up
   assessments after training completion. Data analysis consisted of basic
   characteristics and outcome indicators presented in terms of descriptive
   statistics; inferential statistics were estimated by generalized
   estimating equations.
   Results: The participants were mostly male (83.1\%) with an average age
   of 71.5 (SD = 11.4). Both the experimental and control groups showed
   statistically significant improvement in correct breathing technique and
   application of breathing technique from baseline for each follow-up (p <
   0.001). A significantly increase in self-efficacy for the experimental
   group was found immediately after completing the breathing retraining
   program compared to the control group (p = 0.045).
   Conclusion: Our tablet computer-assisted educational aid did not provide
   an improvement over the traditional method for teaching breathing
   techniques to elderly patients with COPD. The results only showed an
   immediate effect on the self-efficacy of the breathing technique. The
   elderly did not use the tablet computer actively and the research was
   conducted without intervention after discharge, which may be a reason
   why the effect did not last. Further research to evaluate the
   effectiveness of such a strategy for the elderly is needed in the
   future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Anomaly Detection and Repair for Accurate Predictions in Geo-distributed
   Big Data},
Journal = {BIG DATA RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The increasing presence of geo-distributed sensor networks implies the
   generation of huge volumes of data from multiple geographical locations
   at an increasing rate. This raises important issues which become more
   challenging when the final goal is that of the analysis of the data for
   forecasting purposes or, more generally, for predictive tasks. This
   paper proposes a framework which supports predictive modeling tasks from
   streaming data coming from multiple geo-referenced sensors. In
   particular, we propose a distance-based anomaly detection strategy which
   considers objects described by embedding features learned via a stacked
   auto-encoder. We then devise a repair strategy which repairs the data
   detected as anomalous exploiting non-anomalous data measured by sensors
   in nearby spatial locations. Subsequently, we adopt Gradient Boosted
   Trees (GBTs) to predict/forecast values assumed by a target variable of
   interest for the repaired newly arriving (unlabeled) data, using the
   original feature representation or the embedding feature representation
   learned via the stacked auto-encoder. The workflow is implemented with
   distributed Apache Spark programming primitives and tested on a cluster
   environment. We perform experiments to assess the performance of each
   module, separately and in a combined manner, considering the predictive
   modeling of one-day-ahead energy production, for multiple renewable
   energy sites. Accuracy results show that the proposed framework allows
   reducing the error up to 13.56\%. Moreover, scalability results
   demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework in terms of
   speedup, scaleup and execution time under a stress test. (C) 2019

Abstract = {In this article, we present the development and treatment of an inverse
   problem applied to data from the Felix Baumgartner stratospheric jump.
   This jump is well documented with a lot of data. Therefore, it makes a
   particularly well-suited example for teaching in a numerical techniques
   laboratory. The major aim of the article is to give guidelines in order
   to construct a simple, but not simplistic, inverse problem with real
   data for junior undergraduate students. Students should master classical
   mechanics and have some skills in numerical modelling. We use the
   programming language Python and various libraries in order to build a
   model and solve the entire problem. This programming language is
   increasingly used and understood by students, which allows them to focus
   on the physical and numerical aspects of the involved problem. The
   fairly new strategy presented in this article is an attempt to estimate
   the angle of attack from acceleration measurements, and to give an
   uncertainty estimation of Baumgartner's free-fall speed.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Academic remediation offered after failure in a
   knowledge-based progress-test assessment is voluntary and involves
   student-centered individualized support that helps students to learn
   most effectively for themselves. This paper explores whether accepting
   or declining the offer of academic remediation given to struggling
   students impacts their outcomes both short-term and
   longitudinally.Method: Data was collated from 2015-16, 2016-17, and
   2017-18 and included all students offered academic remediation in the
   third, fourth, and fifth years of a five-year Dentistry program.
   Z-scores for each stage and test were calculated and centered on a
   triggering point; the point at which the offer of remediation was made.
   These students' average performance post-trigger test and longitudinal
   performance were analyzed.Results: While performance for both groups
   significantly improved for the immediate post-trigger test after
   academic remediation, those that accepted remediation sustained
   longitudinal improvements across subsequent tests compared to those that
   declined remediation.Discussion: Through the academic remediation
   support process students appear to increase their mastery of learning to
   learn and are able to implement sustainable effective learning
   strategies to carry with them throughout their program.Conclusion:
   Students who accept academic remediation maintain a more successful
   academic profile compared to those that do not take advantage of this.},

Title = {A Disassembly Sequence Planning Method With Team-Based Genetic Algorithm
   for Equipment Maintenance in Hydropower Station},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {47538-47555},
Abstract = {Disassembly sequence planning (DSP) is an important part of equipment
   maintenance in a hydropower station. In this paper, the generation of an
   excellent disassembly sequence (DS) for equipment is studied. Firstly,
   according to the characteristics of hydropower equipment, a combination
   node type is added to the directed graph analysis model, and the
   distance factor of components in space is added to the evaluation
   function of DS. Secondly, a DSP strategy including the grouping and
   minimization of the node's scope is adopted to reduce computational
   complexity. Thirdly, a novel team-based genetic algorithm (TBGA)
   combining teams, fast feasible solution generator (FFSG), precedence
   preservative crossover (PPX) mechanism, multi-point heuristic mutation
   (MHM) mechanism, and forward-and-backward optimization operator (FBOO)
   is designed for DSP. The proposed TBGA maintains global search
   capabilities through teams and enhances local search capabilities
   through individuals. In the evolutionary process, teams, MHM, and FBOO
   have good complementarity to improve the comprehensive performance of
   the algorithm. Finally, four experiments are conducted and the
   performance of TBGA is tested based on the comparison of a well-known
   genetic algorithm, simplified teaching-learning-based optimization, and
   simplified swarm optimization algorithm. The results show that the
   proposed method can get better search results in limited iterations and
   require only about 25\% time of other algorithms.},

Abstract = {Community-based participatory (CBP) strategies are considered important
   to efforts to eliminate disparities. This paper outlines how the Program
   for the Elimination of Cancer Disparities (PECaD) uses CBP strategies as
   a part of a long-term cancer education, prevention, and control strategy
   in an urban community. Community partnerships have proved to be vital
   resources to inform PECaD's agenda and the research practice of academic
   partners. We begin with a description of PECaD governance and
   partnership structures. The paper then describes programmatic activities
   and successes, including efforts to monitor clinical trials, deployment
   of mammography resources, anti-smoking, and prostate and colorectal
   cancer (CRC) screening education. The influence of changes in funding
   priorities, preventive screening policy, and community partner
   development on the partnership process over time is discussed. PECaD
   community partners have grown and expanded beyond the Program's mission
   and developed additional partnerships, resulting in a reevaluation of
   relationships. The impact of these external and internal changes and
   pressures on the partnerships are noted. The evolution of the evaluation
   process and what it has revealed about needed improvements in PECaD
   activities and operations is presented. A summary of the lessons learned
   and their implications for CBP practice are provided.},

Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},

Abstract = {A major patient safety challenge is recognition and response to
   deteriorating patients since early warning signs are often not detected
   in a timely manner. Nursing students typically learn the skills for
   early identification through clinical placement, but clinical placements
   are not guaranteed to provide exposure to deteriorating patients.
   Nursing students require practice with emergency scenarios to develop
   their competency and confidence to act in this area. This study aimed to
   explore the impact of a virtual simulation intervention on the
   recognition and response to the rapidly deteriorating patient among
   undergraduate nursing students. A mixed methods study involving a
   quasi-experimental pre/post design and focus groups. The participants
   were third or final year undergraduate nursing students from five
   university sites across four countries (Canada, England, Scotland and
   Australia, n = 88). Students were randomly assigned to a treatment or
   control group. The treatment group received a virtual simulation
   intervention and participated in a focus group. The virtual simulation
   intervention had a significant effect on improving nursing student
   knowledge and clinical self-efficacy in the recognition and response to
   the rapidly deteriorating patient. Students reported that the virtual
   simulations decreased anxiety, helped them prioritize, filled gaps in
   their learning, and encouraged autonomous learning within a safe `low
   risk' environment. Virtual simulation is an effective strategy for
   improving knowledge and confidence in recognizing and responding to the
   rapidly deteriorating patient among undergraduate nursing students.},

Title = {Heuristics as conceptual lens for understanding and studying the usage

Journal = {SCIENTOMETRICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {120},

Abstract = {While bibliometrics are widely used for research evaluation purposes, a
   common theoretical framework for conceptually understanding, empirically
   studying, and effectively teaching its usage is lacking. In this paper,
   we outline such a framework: the fast-and-frugal heuristics research
   program, proposed originally in the context of the cognitive and
   decision sciences, lends itself particularly well for understanding and
   investigating the usage of bibliometrics in research evaluations. Such
   evaluations represent judgments under uncertainty in which typically not
   all possible options, their consequences, and those consequences'
   probabilities of occurring may be known. In these situations of
   incomplete information, candidate descriptive and prescriptive models of
   human behavior are heuristics. Heuristics are simple strategies that, by
   exploiting the structure of environments, can aid people to make smart
   decisions. Relying on heuristics does not mean trading off accuracy
   against effort: while reducing complexity, heuristics can yield better
   decisions than more information-greedy procedures in many decision
   environments. The prescriptive power of heuristics is documented in a
   cross-disciplinary literature, cutting across medicine, crime, business,
   sports, and other domains. We outline the fast-and-frugal heuristics
   research program, provide examples of past empirical work on heuristics
   outside the field of bibliometrics, explain why heuristics may be
   especially suitable for studying the usage of bibliometrics, and propose
   a corresponding conceptual framework.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The burden of surgical error is high errors threaten patient
   safety, lead to increased economic costs to society, and contribute to
   physician and resident burnout. To date, the majority of work has
   focused on strategies for reducing the incidence of surgical error,
   however, total error eradication remains unrealistic. Errors are, to
   some extent, unavoidable. Adequate preparation for practice should
   include optimal ways to manage and recover from errors; yet, these
   skills are rarely taught or assessed.
   OBJECTIVES: This study aims to explore residents' perceptions and
   experiences of surgical error recovery. More specifically, we documented
   participant definitions of error recovery, and explored factors that
   were perceived to influence error recovery experiences and training in
   the operating room.
   METHOD: Guided by a qualitative descriptive approach, we conducted
   semi-structured interviews with residents and fellows in surgical
   specialties in Canada and the United States. Purposive and snowball
   sampling were used to recruit residents and fellows in postgraduate year
   1 to 5. Interviews were transcribed, analyzed and inductively coded.
   RESULTS: A total of 15 residents and fellows participated. When
   exploring the importance of error recovery for the trainees, competency
   and safety emerged as main themes, with error recovery being considered
   an indicator of overall surgical competency. Data concerning factors
   perceived to influence error recovery training were grouped under 4
   major themes: (1) supervision (supervisor-related factors such as
   attending behaviors and reactions to errors), (2) self (factors such as
   self-assessed competency), (3) surgical context (factors related to the
   specific surgery or patient), and (4) situation safeness. Situational
   safeness was identified as a transversal theme describing factors to be
   considered when balancing between patient safety and the learning
   benefits of error recovery training.
   CONCLUSION: Error recovery was considered to be an important skill for
   safe surgical practice and was considered an important educational
   target for learners during surgical training. Trainees' opportunities to
   learn to recover from technical errors in the OR are perceived to be
   influenced by several factors, leading to variable experiences and
   inconsistent opportunities to practice error recovery skills. Focusing
   on factors related to ``supervision,{''} ``self,{''} ``surgery,{''} and
   ``situational safeness{''} may be an initial framework on which to build
   initial educational interventions to support the development of error
   recovery skills to better support safe surgical practice. ((C) 2021

Abstract = {Background: Engineering-oriented bridge programs and camps are popular
   strategies for broadening participation. The students who often serve as
   counselors and mentors in these programs are integral to their
   success.Purpose: Predicated on the belief that mentoring contributes to
   positive outcomes for the mentors themselves, we sought to understand
   how undergraduate student mentors approached and experienced their work
   with a 6-day overnight, NSF-sponsored youth engineering camp (YEC). This
   study was guided by the question: How did YEC camp counselors approach
   and experience their roles as mentors?Design/Methods: We conducted an
   exploratory qualitative study of four Black undergraduate engineering
   students' experiences with and approaches to near-peer mentorship in the
   YEC program. Data consisted of transcripts from two post-program
   interviews and one written reflection from each participant. We analyzed
   data through abductive coding and the funds of knowledge
   framework.Results: Through subsequent interpretation of code categories,
   we found YEC mentors: (1) engaged in altruistic motivations as YEC
   mentors, (2) leveraged previous experiences to guide their approaches to
   mentorship, and (3) engaged in self-directed learning and
   development.Conclusions: This study highlights the knowledge and
   strategies that YEC mentors drew upon in their roles, and how they
   sought and achieved various personal, academic, and professional
   benefits. Insights from this study illustrate how near-peer mentors can
   support their and others' engineering aspirations.},

Abstract = {Despite a lack of intent to discriminate, physicians educated in U.S.
   medical schools and residency programs often take actions that
   systematically disadvantage minority patients. The approach to
   assessment of learner performance in medical education can similarly
   disadvantage minority learners. The adoption of holistic admissions
   strategies to increase the diversity of medical training programs has
   not been accompanied by increases in diversity in honor societies,
   selective residency programs, medical specialties, and medical school
   faculty. These observations prompt justified concerns about structural
   and interpersonal bias in assessment. This manuscript characterizes
   equity in assessment as a ``wicked problem{''} with inherent conflicts,
   uncertainty, dynamic tensions, and susceptibility to contextual
   influences. The authors review the underlying individual and structural
   causes of inequity in assessment. Using an organizational model, they
   propose strategies to achieve equity in assessment and drive
   institutional and systemic improvement based on clearly articulated
   principles. This model addresses the culture, systems, and assessment
   tools necessary to achieve equitable results that reflect stated
   principles. Three components of equity in assessment that can be
   measured and evaluated to confirm success include intrinsic equity
   (selection and design of assessment tools), contextual equity ( the
   learning environment in which assessment occurs), and instrumental
   equity (uses of assessment data for learner advancement and selection
   and program evaluation). A research agenda to address these challenges
   and controversies and demonstrate reduction in bias and discrimination
   in medical education is presented.},

Abstract = {Advanced abatement technology adoption has been attached a great
   importance upon the economic profit especially in the traditional energy
   intensive industries. In making the adoption decision, a firm has to
   evaluate the economic profit between the adoption of the advanced
   technologies and the traditional ones. Moreover, due to the
   learning-by-searching (LBS) effect, it is preferable to invest upon the
   installed abatement technology to further increasing the economic
   profit. Thus, to describe a comprehensive decision strategy, we proposed
   a hybrid model including output, R\&D investment as well as the adoption
   time to be optimized at the same time. Regarding these as the decision
   variables, our formulation gives rise to an optimal switching problem
   for a hybrid system, however, which can hardly be solved analytically.
   To implement the numerical simulation, we make a transformation in the
   parameter filed in order to use the control vector parameterization
   method to solve the original problem. Thus, the proposed optimal control
   problem can be converted into a non-linear programming problem (NLP),
   which can be solved conveniently and effectively using the current
   technique. Based on these facts, we shows that some key economic
   parameters that inherently define the revenue relationships outside the
   firm can significantly influence the time of adoption. Furthermore,
   considering the problem in the multi-technology adoption case, the
   process can perform in such an unusual way that the firm can leap over
   some transition technologies to adopt a higher advanced one directly,
   from which corresponding results are discussed as well. (C) 2016

Abstract = {The metabolic wiring of patient cells is altered drastically in many
   diseases, including cancer. Understanding the nature of such changes may
   pave the way for new therapeutic opportunities as well as the
   development of personalized treatment strategies for patients. In this
   paper, we propose an algorithm called Metabolitics, which allows
   systems-level analysis of changes in the biochemical network of cells in
   disease states. It enables the study of a disease at both reaction- and
   pathway-level granularities for a detailed and summarized view of
   disease etiology. Metabolitics employs flux variability analysis with a
   dynamically built objective function based on biofluid metabolomics
   measurements in a personalized manner. Moreover, Metabolitics builds
   supervised classification models to discriminate between patients and
   healthy subjects based on the computed metabolic network changes. The
   use of Metabolitics is demonstrated for three distinct diseases, namely,
   breast cancer, Crohn's disease, and colorectal cancer. Our results show
   that the constructed supervised learning models successfully
   differentiate patients from healthy individuals by an average f1-score
   of 88 percent. Besides, in addition to the confirmation of previously
   reported breast cancer-associated pathways, we discovered that Biotin
   Metabolism along with Arginine and Proline Metabolism is subject to a
   significant increase in flux capacity, which have not been reported
   before.},

Title = {Addressing Peer-to-Peer Resident Mistreatment Through the Use of Forum
   Theatre: A Pilot Intervention},

Abstract = {ProblemResidents may experience mistreatment by faculty, peers, nurses,
   or patients. While faculty are reportedly the primary contributors to
   mistreatment, residents can also be offenders, which merits study. Forum
   theatre (FT) is an experiential learning modality requiring a peer group
   to develop problem-solving strategies. FT was piloted to address
   mistreatment among residents. The objective was to determine whether FT
   was feasible, acceptable to resident learners, and could lead to
   self-reported changes in perceptions or behaviors, providing program
   directors a focused option to address professionalism as a competency.
   ApproachThis initiative was conducted from September 2019 through
   February 2021 in obstetrics-gynecology and urology residencies at UT
   Health San Antonio and consisted of 3 phases: a focus group to identify
   mistreatment experienced by residents, resident volunteers to create and
   act out the FT scenario, and enactment of the FT scenario during
   didactic time. Residents completed anonymous retrospective pre- and
   postsurveys, as well as at 6-8 months after, to assess knowledge,
   attitudes, and self-reported and observed behaviors. Wilcoxon rank-sum
   tests and 2-sample t tests for proportions were used to compare
   variables between groups. OutcomesThe FT was completed successfully in
   both departments during didactic time. Twenty-six residents
   participated, 24 (92\%) responded. Most respondents (23, 96\%) would
   recommend FT to colleagues for teaching professionalism. Behavior
   changes were reported by 15 (63\%) participants after the program. After
   6-8 months, self-reported mistreatment behaviors had decreased,
   including ``making fun of others{''} (15 (63\%) to 10 (38\%), P = .04)
   and sending ``disparaging texts{''} (13 (54\%) to 7 (27\%), P =.02).
   Next StepsThe use of FT during regularly scheduled didactic times was
   feasible and well received among residents. The evaluation demonstrated
   sustained self-reported behavior changes. Plans are ongoing to expand
   this approach to other medical specialties and professions
   institutionally.},

Abstract = {In this letter, we present a novel framework of 3D scene based beam
   selection for mmWave communications that relies only on the
   environmental data and deep learning techniques. Different from other
   out-of-band side-information aided communication strategies, the
   proposed one fully utilizes the environmental information, e.g., the
   shape, the position, and even the materials of the surrounding
   buildings/cars/trees that are obtained from 3D scene reconstruction.
   Specifically, we build the neural networks with the input as point cloud
   of the 3D scene and the output as the beam indices. Compared with the
   LIDAR aided technique, the reconstructed 3D scene here is achieved from
   multiple images taken offline from cameras and thus significantly lowers
   down the cost and makes itself applicable for small mobile terminals.
   Simulation results show that the proposed 3D scene based beam selection
   can outperform the LIDAR method in terms of accuracy.},

Title = {A combined intelligent and game theoretical methodology for
   collaborative multicenter pickup and delivery problems with time window
   assignment},
Journal = {APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Collaborative multicenter pickup and delivery problems with time window
   assignment (CMPDPTWA) are introduced in this paper and formulated and
   solved as a two-stage optimization problem. First, the collaborative
   mechanism achieves optimal transportation resource configuration in a
   multicenter logistics network. Second, open-closed mixed pickup and
   delivery routes satisfying the demands and time windows of customers are
   proposed to enhance transportation efficiency and reduce the total
   logistics operating cost. A set of candidate-time windows is assigned to
   the corresponding customers through time window assignment (TWA)
   strategy to increase the operational efficiency of logistics network. A
   bi-objective programming model for CMPDPTWA is formulated to minimize
   the number of vehicles and total operating cost. An improved k-means
   clustering algorithm is used to cluster customers according to their
   proximities to pickup and delivery centers for reducing the
   computational complexity to solve the abovementioned problem. A
   self-learning non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (SNSGA-II) is
   proposed to optimize the open-closed mixed pickup and delivery routes in
   CMPDPTWA. An update mechanism for the probabilities of crossover and
   mutation is devised to improve the efficiency of searching the solution
   space, and thus to accelerate the convergence of SNSGA-II. The
   performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with that of other
   algorithms, and the results indicate that it can generate near-optimal
   solutions for CMPDPTWA. A game theoretical method involving a cost gap
   allocation model and the strictly monotonic path strategy is proposed to
   find the best profit allocation scheme and the optimal coalition
   sequence for stabilizing the collaborative coalition. Finally, the
   proposed method is applied to a case study using the real-world
   logistics network in Chongqing City, China. Six scenarios with and
   without the collaborative mechanism and TWA strategy are simulated and
   compared with one another to verify the efficacy of the proposed method.
   The results show that the collaborative mechanism and TWA strategy can
   improve the utilization of transportation resources and operational
   efficiency. Thus, they can facilitate an efficient and sustainable urban
   logistics network. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Construction of an effective model for regression to fit data samples
   with noise or outlier is a challenging work. In this paper, in order to
   reduce the influence of noise or outlier on regression and further
   improve the prediction performance of standard twin support vector
   regression (TSVR), we proposed a fast clustering-based weighted TSVR,
   termed as FC-WTSVR. First, we use a fast clustering algorithm to quickly
   classify samples into different categories based on their similarities.
   Secondly, to reflect the prior structural information and distinguish
   contributions of samples located at different positions to regression,
   we introduce the covariance matrix and weighted diagonal matrix into the
   primal problems of FC-WTSVR, respectively. Finally, to shorten the
   training time, we adopt the successive over-relaxation algorithm to
   solve the quadratic programming problems. The results show that the
   proposed FC-WTSVR can obtain better prediction performance and
   anti-interference capability than some state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Title = {An integrated computational intelligence technique based operating
   parameters optimization scheme for quality improvement oriented

Abstract = {The analysis and improvement of product quality for process industry is
   an increasing concern for academia and industry. As the outputs of a
   manufacturing system mainly depend on corresponding input conditions, so
   it is of high significance to develop an optimization scheme to actively
   and accurately determine operating parameters to obtain desired quality.
   However, the widely employed single-model modeling mode for whole
   production process neglects the natural characteristics within process
   manufacturing system such as multistage manufacturing and hysteresis.
   Additionally, the popular data-driven modeling techniques in current
   works, especially black-box machine learning models have been restricted
   to satisfying the requirements regarding excellent approximation
   capability and explicit mathematical expression simultaneously. To fill
   up above research gap, it is meaningful to develop a new data-driven
   optimization scheme in this work to effectively and accurately determine
   the optimum operating parameters considering the abovementioned
   characteristics and requirements. Firstly, two different connecting
   strategies are discussed to determine the more accurate and feasible
   quality propagation mode between adjacent stages. Then, two
   computational intelligence (CI) techniques, i.e., Multi-Gene Genetic
   Programming (MGGP) and Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization
   (MOPSO) algorithm are exploited to construct correlation model with
   explicit mathematical expression and derive the optimal operating
   parameters, respectively. Afterwards, the fuzzy Multi-criteria Decision
   Making (FMCDM) method is further proposed to select the optimal solution
   from the obtained Pareto solutions sets. The application of the proposed
   scheme in a coal preparation process indicates that the proposed scheme
   is promising and competitive on prediction accuracy and optimization
   efficiency over baseline methods, and can significantly improve the
   final product quality comparing with initial parameters setting.
   Moreover, the feasible quality specification for intermediate product
   can also be obtained by our proposed scheme which is beneficial for
   early detection of quality abnormality and timely parameters adjustment.},

Abstract = {College laboratories are generally perceived to be low-risk environments
   in comparison to industrial laboratories and plant operations. However,
   accidents in college chemistry laboratories have revealed the safety
   conditions to which both students and staff may be exposed. Improving
   the effectiveness of laboratory safety training programs and chemical
   safety education requires gaining an understanding of how undergraduate
   students may perceive the risk associated with chemistry laboratory
   settings. This study characterized risk perceptions of safety hazards in
   chemistry laboratories among college students. Undergraduate college
   students from the chemistry and biology department of a university in
   Mexico were surveyed. The Workers' Risk Perception Dimensional
   Evaluation (EDRP-T) was used to characterize risk perceptions through
   nine dimensions and the overall perceived risk for three risk factors:
   laboratory work, chemical splashes, and chemical-substances inhalation.
   Perceived risk was characterized in a sample of 521 undergraduate
   students. Students felt confident in successfully dealing with the risk
   factors evaluated despite feelings of dread and vulnerability as well as
   concerns about the severity of the consequences of an injury. Their
   perceived ability to control and avoid these risks might have reflected
   the students' self-efficacy. Discrepancies in characterizing risk
   perception as a multidimensional construct or a direct, measurable
   characteristic were identified. Gaining an understanding about what
   undergraduate students do and do not perceive as hazardous is a valuable
   input to develop risk management and communication strategies with the
   potential to influence students' decision-making process that can result
   in safer behaviors. Successful design and implementation of chemical
   education programs requires recognizing gaps at all levels.},

Abstract = {Designing is a problem-solving process, which the professional designers
   need for higher imagination and creativity to carry on the
   problem-solving. In the research, we aim to develop a training program
   which helps designers to enhance the mechanism of imagination during
   industrial designing. First, imagination and creativity theories, design
   cognition and thinking, design methods and techniques are being explored
   by way of a literature survey in order to gain a deeper understanding of
   the structure and mechanism of human imagination. Research methods for
   design thinking, the pattern of imagination, the factors that affect the
   imagination, and developing techniques and teaching methods for
   imagination, have then been inducted for further studies. We then
   explored the forty international professional designers using secondary
   interview data. The data was analyzed based on the abstract and
   concrete, the activities, location, etc., the source of imaginative
   inspiration for the designers were categorized. The results showed that
   two designers using an abstract way of generating an imagination and
   inspiration mode accounted for 58\%, using concrete objects to achieve
   the source of inspiration accounts for 42\%. Indoor activities accounted
   for 64\% inspiration of the factors of environmental stimulation, 36\%
   were outdoor activities. Therefore, for the learning strategy, we
   conclude that enhancing the cognitive and experience-driven skills to
   gain insights from a variety of life experiences, expands the implicit
   design knowledge for the cognitive activities to trigger the imagination
   in the design thinking of designing.},

Title = {Families of similar surrogate forms based on predictive accuracy and
   model complexity},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {163},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The prevalence of many diverse surrogate forms and absence of common
   insights to identify the best form make exhaustive, enumerative, and
   tedious search imperative for surrogate selection in most applications.
   In this work, we aim to develop some insights into the similarities
   between varied surrogate forms, which could ease and limit the surrogate
   selection process. We present a modified index to judge such similarity,
   and use 49 forms, two quality metrics, many noisy and non-noisy data
   sets to identify families of similar forms by solving a series of
   mixed-integer linear programs. All our generated families were
   successfully validated using several additional data sets. We propose a
   faster family-based strategy for surrogate selection. The best form
   identified by this strategy is either the same as or performs very much
   like the true best form. This work sheds useful light on the performance
   of various surrogates, and expedites surrogate selection.(c) 2022

Title = {Supporting health professional educators in the workplace: A scoping
   review},
Journal = {MEDICAL TEACHER},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUL 29},
Abstract = {Purpose Clinical educators frequently request additional support for
   educating pre-qualification health professions students despite having
   access to professional development programs to build education knowledge
   and skills. The breadth of `additional support' options remains unclear.
   The aim of this review is to explore what is known about support options
   for health professional educators in the workplace through the lens of
   learning organisations. Materials and methods A scoping review was
   conducted searching Ovid Medline, CINAHL, ProQuest and PsycINFO
   electronic databases from 1 January 2005 up to 21 October 2020 for
   studies that identified support strategies for clinical educators of
   pre-qualification students in the workplace. Relevant data were charted,
   summarised thematically and synthesised with reference to support type
   and implementation level. Results Fifty relevant records related to
   medicine, nursing and allied health clinical education were included.
   Twelve support themes and five cross-cutting support categories were
   identified across four implementation levels of healthcare systems.
   Conclusions A diversity of support for clinical educators beyond
   professional development was identified. Future research combined with
   leadership and commitment from the healthcare and education sectors is
   needed to better understand the applicability, efficacy and resourcing
   of any newly integrated support to ensure it is sustainable and improves
   clinical educator capability.},

Abstract = {An extension of Campbell and Bennett's novelty detection or one-class
   classification model incorporating prior knowledge is studied in the
   paper. The proposed extension relaxes the strong assumption of the
   empirical probability distribution over elements of a training set and
   deals with a set of probability distributions produced by prior
   knowledge about training data. The classification problem is solved by
   considering extreme points of the probability distribution set or by
   means of the conjugate duality technique. Special cases of prior
   knowledge are considered in detail, including the imprecise
   linear-vacuous mixture model and interval-valued moments of feature
   values. Numerical experiments show that the proposed models outperform
   Campbell and Bennett's model for many real and synthetic data.},

Abstract = {Supplier's coordination plays a vital role in managing a supply chain.
   Organizations have learned that selecting the right suppliers and
   allocating right orders are the keys to success. The presence of
   disruption risks in the supply chain creates more complexity in the
   supplier selection and order allocation process. This paper presents a
   mixed-integer nonlinear programming model to optimize supplier selection
   and order allocation simultaneously in centralized supply chains
   considering disruption risks. In order to reduce disruption effects, two
   protective policies are taken into account. Protection policy for the
   selected suppliers and emergency inventory allocation policy for the
   protected suppliers are utilized in this study. The presented model
   proves to be non convex, indicating that, conventional methods are not
   capable of solving such a complex problem. The proposed method is
   exemplified by numerical instances. The results indicate that with an
   increase in the disruption probability the factors which effect the
   decisions related to supplier selection and order allocation are
   altered. At the low disruption probability, the disruption risk plays a
   key role in the decisions, while at the higher disruption probability,
   wholesale price and disruption risk are the dominant factors to form the
   decisions.},

Title = {The implementation of a quality system in the Dutch GP specialty
   training: barriers and facilitators; a qualitative study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {JUL 21},
Abstract = {Background: Quality assurance programs in medical education are
   introduced to gain insight into the quality of such programs and to
   trigger improvements. Although of utmost importance, research on the
   implementation of such programs is scarce. The Dutch General Practice
   (GP) specialty training institutes used an implementation strategy to
   implement a quality system (QS), and we aimed to study the success of
   this strategy and to learn about additional facilitators and barriers.
   Methods: Seventeen structured interviews were conducted with the
   directors and quality coordinators (QCs) of the eight Dutch GP training
   institutes. A five-stage process model of implementation was used to
   structure these interviews and analyze the data. Two researchers
   analyzed the data with a framework approach.
   Results: The strategy supported the institutes in implementing the QS.
   However, after the introduction of the QS, staff experienced the QS as
   demanding, although they noticed almost no concrete short-term results.
   Moreover, they experienced difficulties in integrating the QS into their
   local situation. Collectively working with the QS and following common
   deadlines did create a sense of commitment towards each other that
   appeared to be a true stimulus to the introduction of the QS.
   Conclusions: The implementation strategy focused mainly on the
   introduction of the QS in the GP specialty training, and it was, as
   such, rather successful. An important barrier concerned the acceptance
   of the QS and the integration of the QS into local structures, which
   suggests that there is a need for guidance on the translation of the QS
   to local contexts. All in all, we recommend more focus on the benefits
   of a QS.},

Title = {It Can Be Done! A Skills-Based Elective in Implicit Bias Recognition and
   Management for Preclinical Medical Students},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {95},
Number = {12, S},
Pages = {S150-S155},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Purpose
   Students perceive bias in learning environments. Curricula targeting
   implicit bias recognition and management increase student awareness and
   achieve strategy identification, but fall short of actual skill
   development to address bias. In light of this gap, the authors developed
   and evaluated a skills-based elective to recognize and manage implicit
   bias in the learning environment.
   Method
   Nine 1.5-hour sessions were delivered to 15 first-year medical students
   from 2017 to 2019. An evidence-based conceptual framework and
   transformative learning theory informed the instructional design; it
   incorporated active learning exercises. Skills assessment occurred
   through direct observation of student performances in role-play
   exercises. Using thematic analysis, the authors conducted a program
   evaluation based on focus groups with students and data from notes taken
   by the investigative team.
   Results
   Students engaged with all aspects of instruction, including role-plays.
   Authors identified 3 themes from the program evaluation: (1) Student
   engagement can be enhanced, (2) Instruction is empowering, and (3) It
   (addressing bias in one's own and witnessed encounters) can be done!
   Analysis additionally highlighted opportunities for improvement and
   lessons learned.
   Conclusions
   This innovative course achieved skill development and practice for
   medical students in implicit bias recognition and management as it
   pertains to 3 facets of clinical care present at every stage of a health
   professional's career. These include interpersonal encounters,
   advocating for patients when bias is perceived in witnessed encounters
   with peers and supervisors, and addressing comments made by others
   within the learning environment. Outcomes could inform novel,
   skills-based curricula across the spectrum of health professions
   training and practice.},

Title = {Hermes: Latency Optimal Task Assignment for Resource-constrained Mobile
   Computing},

Abstract = {With mobile devices increasingly able to connect to cloud servers from
   anywhere, resource-constrained devices can potentially perform
   offloading of computational tasks to either save local resource usage or
   improve performance. It is of interest to find optimal assignments of
   tasks to local and remote devices that can take into account the
   application- specific profile, availability of computational resources,
   and link connectivity, and find a balance between energy consumption
   costs of mobile devices and latency for delay-sensitive applications. We
   formulate an NP-hard problem to minimize the application latency while
   meeting prescribed resource utilization constraints. Different from most
   of existing works that either rely on the integer programming solver, or
   on heuristics that offer no theoretical performance guarantees, we
   propose Hermes, a novel fully polynomial time approximation scheme
   (FPTAS). We identify for a subset of problem instances, where the
   application task graphs can be described as serial trees, Hermes
   provides a solution with latency no more than (1 + epsilon) times of the
   minimum while incurring complexity that is polynomial in problem size
   and 1/epsilon. We further propose an online algorithm to learn the
   unknown dynamic environment and guarantee that the performance gap
   compared to the optimal strategy is bounded by a logarithmic function
   with time. Evaluation is done by using real data set collected from
   several benchmarks, and is shown that Hermes improves the latency by 16
   percent compared to a previously published heuristic and increases CPU
   computing time by only 0: 4 percent of overall latency.},

Title = {Transforming the Academic Faculty Perspective in Graduate Medical
   Education to Better Align Educational and Clinical Outcomes},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {91},
Number = {4},
Pages = {473-479},

Abstract = {The current health care delivery model continues to fall short in
   achieving the desired patient safety and quality-ofcare outcomes for
   patients. And, until recently, an explicit acknowledgment of the role
   and influence of the clinical learning environment on professional
   development had been missing from physician-based competency frameworks.
   In this Perspective, the authors explore the implications of the
   insufficient integration of education about patient safety and quality
   improvement by academic faculty into the clinical learning environment
   in many graduate medical education (GME) programs, and the important
   role that academic faculty need to play to better align the educational
   and clinical contexts to improve both learner and patient outcomes.
   The authors propose a framework that closely aligns the educational and
   clinical contexts, such that both educational and clinical outcomes are
   centered around the patient. This will require a reorganization of
   academic faculty perspective and educational design of GME training
   programs that recognizes that (1) the dynamic interplay between the
   faculty, learner, training program, and clinical microsystem ultimately
   influences the quality of physician that emerges from the training
   program and environment, and (2) patient outcomes relate to the quality
   of education and the success of clinical microsystems. To enable this
   evolution, there is a need to revisit the core competencies expected of
   academic faculty, implement innovative faculty development strategies,
   examine closely faculty's current clinical supervision practices, and
   establish a training environment that supports bridging from clinician
   to educator, training program to clinical microsystem, and educational
   outcomes to clinical outcomes that benefit patients.},

Title = {Recent Trends in Primary Care Interest and Career Choices Among Medical
   Students at an Academic Medical Institution},
Journal = {TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {42-51},
Abstract = {Phenomenon: As an impending shortage of primary care physicians is
   expected, understanding career trajectories of medical students will be
   useful in supporting interest in primary care fields and careers. The
   authors sought to characterize recent trends in primary care interest
   and career trajectories among medical students at an academic medical
   institution that did not have a family medicine department. Approach:
   Match data for 2,477 graduates who matched into resident training
   programs between 1989 and 2014 were analyzed to determine the proportion
   entering primary care residency programs. An online search and
   confirmatory phone call methodology was used to determine primary care
   career trajectories for the 795 graduates who matched into primary care
   residency programs between 1989 to 2010. Subanalyses were performed to
   characterize primary care career entrance among graduates who matched
   into the three primary care residency programs: Family Medicine,
   Categorical and Primary Care Internal Medicine, and Categorical and
   Primary Care Pediatrics. Findings: Between 1989 and 2014, 911 (37\%) of
   all matched graduates matched into primary care residency programs. Of
   the 795 graduates who matched into these programs between 1989 and 2010,
   less than half (245; 31\%) entered primary care careers. Of the
   graduates who ultimately entered primary care careers, 82\% matched into
   either internal medicine or pediatrics residency programs and 18\%
   matched into family medicine programs. Although there have been
   fluctuations in primary care interest that seem to parallel health care
   trends over the 26-year period, the overall percentage of graduates
   entering primary care residency programs and careers has remained fairly
   stable. Between 2006 and 2010, entrance into both primary care residency
   programs and primary care careers steadily increased. Despite this, the
   overall percentage of matched graduates who entered primary care careers
   over the 22-year study period (12\%) was less than the national average
   (16\%-18\%). Insights: In the 26-year period between 1989 and 2014,
   primary care career interest increased slightly among medical students
   at this academic medical institution, with fluctuations that seem to
   coincide with national health care trends. Year-to-year fluctuations
   appear to be driven by rising numbers of Categorical Pediatrics and
   Categorical Internal Medicine matchers pursuing careers in primary care.
   There may be a need for specialized curricula and strategies to promote
   and retain interest in primary care at academic medical institutions,
   especially at institutions without family medicine training programs.},

Title = {ALBFL: A novel neural ranking model for software fault localization via
   combining static and dynamic features},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {139},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Context: Automatic software fault localization serves as a significant
   purpose in helping developers solve bugs efficiently. Existing
   approaches for software fault localization can be categorized into
   static methods and dynamic ones, which have improved the fault locating
   ability greatly by analyzing static features from the source code or
   tracking dynamic behaviors during the runtime respectively. However, the
   accuracy of fault localization is still unsatisfactory. Objective: To
   enhance the capability of detecting software faults with the statement
   granularity, this paper puts forward ALBFL, a novel neural ranking model
   that combines the static and dynamic features, which obtains excellent
   fault localization accuracy. Firstly, ALBFL learns the semantic features
   of the source code by a transformer encoder. Then, it exploits a
   self-attention layer to integrate those static features and dynamic
   features. Finally, those integrated features are fed into a LambdaRank
   model, which can list the suspicious statements in descending order by
   their ranked scores. Method: The experiments are conducted on an
   authoritative dataset (i.e., Defect4J), which includes 5 open-source
   projects, 357 faulty programs in total. We evaluate the effectiveness of
   ALBFL, effectiveness of combining features, effectiveness of model
   components and aggregation on method level. Result: The results reflect
   that ALBFL identifies triple more faulty statements than 11 traditional
   SBFL methods and outperforms 2 state-of-the-art approaches by on average
   14\% on ranking faults in the first position. Conclusions: To improve
   the precision of automatic software fault localization, ALBFL combines
   neural network ranking model equipped with the self-attention layer and
   the transformer encoder, which can take full use of various techniques
   to judge whether a code statement is fault-inducing or not. Moreover,
   the joint architecture of ALBFL is capable of training the integration
   of these features under various strategies so as to improve accuracy
   further. In the future, we plan to exploit more features so as to
   improve our method's efficiency and accuracy.},

Abstract = {Background: The patient-centered medical home is a model for delivering
   primary care in the United States. Primary care clinicians and their
   staffs require assistance in understanding the innovation and in
   applying it to practice. Purposes: The purpose of this article is to
   describe and to critique a continuing education program that is relevant
   to, and will become more common in, primary care. Methods: A
   multifaceted educational strategy prepared 20 primary care private
   practices to achieve National Committee for Quality Assurance Level 3
   recognition as Patient-Centered Medical Homes. Results: Eighteen (90\%)
   practices submitted an application to the National Committee for Quality
   Assurance. On the first submission attempt, 13 of 18 (72\%) achieved
   Level 3 recognition and 5 (28\%) achieved Level 1 recognition.
   Conclusion: An interactive multifaceted educational strategy can be
   successful in preparing primary care practices for Patient-Centered
   Medical Homes recognition, but the strategy may not ensure
   transformation. Future educational activities should consider an
   expanded outcomes framework and the evidence of effective continuing
   education to be more successful with recognition and transformation.},

Title = {Nurse educators' critical thinking: A mixed methods exploration},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {66},
Pages = {117-122},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Nurse educator's critical thinking remains unexamined as a key factor in
   the development of students' critical thinking.
   Objectives: The objective of this study is to understand how nurse
   educators reveal their critical thinking in the clinical setting while
   supervising students.
   Design: This study uses a single-phase triangulation mixed methods
   design with multiple data gathering techniques.
   Participants/Settings: Participants for this study are clinical nurse
   educators from a large Western Canadian baccalaureate nursing program
   who teach 2nd or 3rd year students in medical-surgical settings.
   Methods: Participants for this study completed a demographic survey, the
   California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST), the California
   Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI), participant observation
   in a clinical practice setting, and semi-structured interviews.
   Results: The results from the California Critical Thinking assessments
   (CCTST and CCTDI) show that participants are positively inclined and
   have a moderate to strong ability to think critically, similar to other
   studies. Participants find it difficult to describe how they reveal
   their critical thinking in the clinical setting, yet all participants
   use role modeling and questioning to share their critical thinking with
   students. When the quantitative and qualitative results are compared, it
   is apparent that the confidence in reasoning subscale of the California
   Critical Thinking Skills Test is higher in those educators who more
   frequently demonstrate and voice engagement in reflective activities.
   Dispositions associated with critical thinking, as measured by the
   California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory, are more easily
   observed compared to critical thinking skills.
   Conclusions: This study is a beginning exploration of nurse educators'
   critical thinking-in-action. Our mixed methods approach uncovers a
   valuable approach to understanding the complexity of nurse educators'
   critical thinking. Further study is needed to uncover how nurse
   educators' can specifically enact their thinking abilities to support
   student learning in the clinical setting.},

Title = {Development of the Awareness of Cultural Safety Scale: A pilot study
   with midwifery and nursing academics},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {44},
Pages = {20-25},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Rates of academic success of Indigenous students compared to
   other students continues to be significantly lower in many first world
   countries. Professional development activities for academics can be used
   to promote teaching, learning and support approaches that value
   Indigenous worldviews. However, there are few valid and reliable tools
   that measure the effect of academic development strategies on awareness
   of cultural safety.
   Objectives: To develop and validate a self-report tool that aims to
   measure nursing and midwifery academics' awareness of cultural safety.
   Methods: This study followed a staged model for tool development. This
   included: generation of items, content validity testing and expert
   Indigenous cultural review, administration of items to a convenience
   sample of academics, and psychometric testing. An online survey
   consisting of demographic questions, Awareness of Cultural Safety Scale
   (ACSS), and awareness of racism items was completed by academics
   undertaking a professional development program on cultural safety.
   Findings: Ratings by experts revealed good content validity with an
   index score of 0.86. The 12-item scale demonstrated good internal
   reliability (Cronbach's alpha of 0.87). An evaluation of construct
   validity through factor analysis generated three factors with sound
   internal reliability: Factor 1 (Cultural Application, Cronbach's alpha =
   .85), Factor 2 (Cultural Support, Cronbach's alpha = .70) and Factor 3
   (Cultural Acknowledgement, Cronbach's alpha = .85). The mean total scale
   score was 46.85 (SD 7.05, range 31-59 out of a possible 60). There was a
   significant correlation between scores on the Awareness of Cultural
   Safety Scale and awareness of racism scores (r = .461, p = .002).
   Conclusion: Awareness of cultural safety is underpinned by principles of
   respect, relationships, and responsibility. Results indicated the ACSS
   was valid and reliable. Completion of the scale aimed to foster
   purposeful consideration by nursing and midwifery academics about their
   perceptions and approaches to teaching in order to improve Indigenous
   student success. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A descriptive, cross-sectional study of medical student preferences for
   vodcast design, format and pedagogical approach},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {MAY 19},
Abstract = {Background: Vodcasts (video podcasts) are becoming increasingly popular
   in medical education. At A. T. Still University School of Osteopathic
   Medicine in Arizona (ATSU SOMA), vodcasts are an essential component of
   our blended learning environment, where year 2-4 students train in a
   contextual setting at community health centers across the U.S. Vodcasts
   are used far less frequently in our year 1 residential learning
   environment at the main campus in Arizona, but we are considering moving
   to significantly more interactive educational experiences with on-demand
   videos followed by in-class activities. The aim of this study was to
   determine stakeholder (i.e. medical student) preferences for vodcast
   design, format, and pedagogical strategies. The overall goal was to
   increase opportunities for students to learn with this modality.
   Methods: An interactive Qualtrics (TM) survey was administered to three
   cohorts of medical students. The survey generated quantitative and
   open-ended response data that addressed principles of vodcast
   instructional design and learning. Responses to survey items were
   analyzed for statistical significance using the independent samples
   t-test for interval data, the chi-square test for categorical data, and
   the Kruskal-Wallis test for ordinal data, using the post-hoc Bonferroni
   procedure to determine the appropriate a level. Responses to open-ended
   prompts were categorized using open-and axial-coding.
   Results: The most highly valued vodcast attributes, considered essential
   by all three cohorts, were clear explanations, organization,
   conciseness, high-yield for medical board exams, and the ability to
   speed vodcasts up. The least helpful vodcast attributes for all three
   cohorts were music and objects moving on screen. The average preferred
   vodcast length for each cohort was 27-28 min. There were significant
   differences between the less experienced learners in the residential
   setting and the more mature learners in the blended learning environment
   regarding certain vodcast attribute preferences, format of included
   practice questions, explanations for preferred vodcast lengths, and
   reasons for not viewing vodcasts.
   Conclusions: Overall, learner preferences were in line with
   non-interactive, screen-capture type vodcasts, which have lower demands
   on institutional cost and faculty production time than Flash (TM)-type
   interactive vodcasts. Students in the blended learning environment were
   much more focused on vodcast features that decreased their time
   commitment, including a preference for noninteractive vodcasts. Given
   the increase in distance learning in medical education, our results
   should be of value to other medical programs.},

Title = {Effects of Hierarchical Mentoring on Freshman Retention in a Biology
   First-Year Experience Course},
Journal = {AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER},

Volume = {80},
Number = {3},
Pages = {184-190},

Abstract = {Higher education must improve student retention and graduation rates to
   meet increased demand for STEM degrees in the workforce projected for
   the next ten years. The high rate of attrition among STEM students
   entering college compels institutions to implement strategies that
   improve student retention because more states now employ
   performance-based funding models with increased pressures to improve
   student outcomes, such as first-and second-year retention rates. We
   piloted a two-year hierarchical mentoring model as part of a first-year
   experience course developed for biology students (BioSkills) to increase
   retention rates among first-time-in-college (FTIC) students. We describe
   the mentoring structure we adopted and how the design of BioSkills
   supports and educates future biology professionals. Our findings show
   that FTIC students who participated in this program earned significantly
   higher first-year GPAs and were retained at higher rates than students
   who did not participate, which documents the impact of BioSkills as a
   successful first-year intervention. However, we were surprised that the
   benefit of BioSkills was not replicated among under-represented minority
   (URM) students. We briefly speculate on explanations for this finding.
   Lastly, we offer best practice suggestions for future implementation.},

Title = {Operationalizing Programmatic Assessment: The CBME Programmatic
   Assessment Practice Guidelines},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {97},
Number = {5},
Pages = {674-678},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Problem Assessing the development and achievement of competence requires
   multiple formative and summative assessment strategies and the
   coordinated efforts of trainees and faculty (who often serve in multiple
   roles, such as academic advisors, program directors, and competency
   committee members). Operationalizing programmatic assessment (PA) in
   competency-based medical education (CBME) requires comprehensive
   practice guidelines, written in accessible language with descriptions of
   stakeholder activities, to move assessment theory into practice and to
   help guide the trainees and faculty who enact PA. Approach Informed by
   the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II)
   framework, the authors used a multiphase, multimethod approach to
   develop the CBME Programmatic Assessment Practice Guidelines (PA
   Guidelines). The 9 guidelines are organized by phases of assessment and
   include descriptions of stakeholder activities. A user guide provides a
   glossary of key terms and summarizes how the guidelines can be used by
   different stakeholder groups across postgraduate medical education
   (PGME) contexts. The 4 phases of guideline development, including
   internal stakeholder consultations and external expert review, occurred
   between August 2016 and March 2020. Outcomes Local stakeholders and
   external experts agreed that the PA Guidelines hold potential for
   guiding initial operationalization and ongoing refinement of PA in CBME
   by individual stakeholders, residency programs, and PGME institutions.
   Since July 2020, the PA Guidelines have been used at Queen's University
   to inform faculty and resident development initiatives, including online
   CBME modules for faculty, workshops for academic advisors/competence
   committee members, and a guide that supports incoming residents'
   transition to CBME. Next Steps Research exploring the use of the PA
   Guidelines and user guide in multiple programs and institutions will
   gather further evidence of their acceptability and utility for guiding
   operationalization of PA in different contexts.},

Title = {Reservoir Computing Model for Human Hand Locomotion Signal
   Classification},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {19591-19601},
Abstract = {Human-movement recognition is a novel challenge in soft robotics. In
   recent years, there have been several attempts to develop soft wearable
   devices for supporting human-robot interfaces. Many algorithms and
   programming languages are available to integrate a wearable device with
   a soft robot. One such promising algorithm is reservoir computing (RC),
   which includes of a group of recurrently and randomly connected nodes.
   The RC model can easily process multidimensional signal data and can
   handle nonlineardata and has been extensively used in robotic control.
   It has been reported that the RC algorithm can speed up network training
   and solve complex data sets. However, the main existing limitations in
   hand-locomotion classification are the considerable run-time and the
   delayed response. In this study, we figure out the best machine learning
   algorithms to handle three-dimensional hand-gesture data. We employ a
   two-part strategy: a loopback filter is included in the preprocessing of
   the initial dataset to support the 3-dimensional (3D) signs of each hand
   posture; subsequently, the training dataset is applied to the machine
   learning algorithm which includes an artificial neural network (ANN),
   convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory(LSTM), and
   reservoir computing(RC). Each training network is optimized with various
   hyperparameters. Furthermore, we compare the performance of several
   machine-learning algorithms in classifying the three-dimensional
   hand-signal posture data. The results show that the classification of
   nonlinear hand-locomotion signals by RC requires a comparatively shorter
   training duration (12 minutes for training times), and that optimal
   accuracy 94.17, precision 94.10, and recall 93.99 is realized for time
   series data.},

Abstract = {During times of stress, such as those experienced during the novel
   coronavirus identified in 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, pharmacy students
   handle the experience differently. For some, the experience may
   negatively impact their sense of well-being; for others, being at home
   with family could actually improve their well-being. While students are
   completing academic work at home and after they finally return to
   campus, pharmacy schools need to be keenly aware of students'
   experiences and implement strategies to build their resilience and
   improve their well-being. One approach will not meet the needs of all
   students. Many of the challenges that pharmacy students have faced or
   will face when they return to the classroom are discussed along with
   some programs and activities that have proven successful.},

   Postsecondary Chemistry Faculty},

Abstract = {Research-based assessments in postsecondary chemistry education have
   been widely developed and published, but their use has not enjoyed the
   same level of focus in the chemistry education research literature as
   evidence-based instructional practices. Several high-quality assessment
   strategies have been developed for use in postsecondary chemistry
   education; however, we have little understanding of the prevalence of
   use of such assessments and the contexts in which those assessments are
   enacted. Framed by the teacher-centered systemic reform model, we
   conducted a survey of United States postsecondary chemistry faculty to
   understand what types of assessments are being used in their courses,
   how assessment use is associated with course characteristics like course
   level and size, and other personal contexts (e.g., participation in
   workshops). The results of our work suggest that utility determines
   assessment use in postsecondary chemistry education. We also identified
   a sample of courses that utilize research-based assessment tools (e.g.,
   concept tests/inventories and measures of affective learning), which are
   uniformly used over a range of courses, suggesting that there is a more
   nuanced picture of assessment tool use than what was captured by our
   survey items. The association between context and enacted assessment
   practices informs the development and dissemination of future assessment
   innovations; we encourage chemistry education researchers to focus on
   course size and level as targets for assessment optimization as well as
   teaching-focused workshops and funding opportunities as vehicles for
   dissemination of research-based assessment tools.},

Abstract = {Traditionally underserved students (TUSs), including Black, Latinx,
   American Native, and low-socioeconomic (SES) students, have higher rates
   of departure from STEM undergraduate programs than their more privileged
   peers. These higher departure rates are associated with TUSs' lower
   performance in STEM gatekeeper courses compared to non-STEM courses
   through their sophomore year. Flipped models of instruction when used in
   gatekeeper chemistry courses are broadly shown to improve student course
   performance (higher course grades; reduced W/D/F rates). However, there
   is no clear evidence that flipped models specifically improve course
   performance for TUSs. This study's objective was to determine the impact
   of a flipped model on students' course performance in General Chemistry
   I on the basis of their race/ethnicity and SES. Using a nonparallel
   quasi-experimental design, student performance by race/ethnicity and SES
   in the flipped model course was compared to that of students in the
   traditional course. Results show TUSs were significantly more likely to
   have higher course grades in the flipped model course as compared to the
   traditional course. Further, the performance gap was closed between
   Black and Latinx students and their White/Asian peers in the flipped
   model. However, a performance gap between low-SES and middle- to
   high-SES students emerged in the flipped model. The W/D/F rate was
   decreased in the flipped model for all student groups. Therefore,
   although flipped models are not a panacea, they can be one critical
   support strategy used in freshman and sophomore chemistry gatekeeper
   courses to mitigate TUSs' departure from STEM undergraduate programs.},

Abstract = {The traditional tennis serving teaching correction method has been
   deeply rooted, and in the current teaching, the teaching method based on
   experience has been used for a long time, relying on the subjective
   consciousness of the coach to guide and supervise the technical
   movements of the athletes. It is said that to master the essentials of
   technical movements proficiently, it is necessary to carry out long-term
   and repetitive exercises according to the coach's guidance. This
   situation seriously restricts the improvement of the level of teaching
   and training. To solve the above problems, the combined application of
   smart sensors and microsystem technology is used to Sensing identify and
   intelligently correct the player serve technology. This article in the
   presentation part initially sums up the movement catch innovation and
   tennis serve innovation and development; then, at that point, in the
   strategy part presents the objective following calculation and normal
   denoising handling calculation; and then, at that point, in the trial
   part presents the person choice, exploratory program, plan astute sensor
   handling framework, and trial examination. This article mainly
   introduces the application, research, and analysis of smart sensors in
   tennis server technology correction equipment, to reduce the burden on
   players and coaches. This article proposes target following
   calculations, normal denoising handling calculations, and so on, which
   are utilized to lead research investigating the use of savvy sensors in
   tennis server innovation adjustment hardware. The trial aftereffects of
   this paper show that the normal acknowledgment exactness of the savvy
   sensor is 91.14\%, and the acknowledgment precision is high, which can
   be better applied to the tennis serve innovation revision hardware.},

Title = {Toward High-Value, Cost-Conscious Care - Supporting Future Doctors to
   Adopt a Role as Stewards of a Sustainable Healthcare System},
Journal = {TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {33},
Number = {5},
Pages = {483-497},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Phenomenon:
   In order to tackle the persistent rise of healthcare costs, physicians
   as ``stewards of scarce resources{''} could be effective change agents,
   extending cost containment efforts from national policy to the micro
   level. Current programs focus on educating future doctors to deliver
   ``high-value, cost-conscious care{''} (HVCCC). Although the importance
   of HVCCC education is increasingly recognized, there is a lag in
   implementation. Whereas recent efforts generated effective interventions
   that promote HVCCC in a local context, gaps persist in the examination
   of system factors that underlie broader successful and lasting
   implementation in educational and healthcare practices.
   Approach:
   We conducted a realist evaluation of a program focused on embedding
   HVCCC in postgraduate education by encouraging and supporting residents
   to set up ``HVCCC projects{''} to promote HVCCC delivery. We interviewed
   39 medical residents and 10 attending physicians involved in such HVCCC
   projects to examine HVCCC implementation in different educational and
   healthcare contexts. We held six reflection sessions attended by the
   program commissioners and educationalists to validate and enrich the
   findings.
   Findings:
   A realist evaluation was used to unravel the facilitators and barriers
   that underlie the implementation of HVCCC in a variety of healthcare
   practices. Whereas research activities regularly stop after the
   identification of facilitators and barriers, we used these insights to
   formulate four high-value, cost-conscious care carriers: (1) continue to
   promote HVCCC awareness, (2) create an institutional structure that
   fosters HVCCC, (3) continue the focus on projects for embedding HVCCC in
   practice, (4) generate evidence. The carriers support residents,
   attendings and others involved in educating physicians in training to
   develop and implement innovative HVCCC projects.
   Insights:
   Strategies to promote physician stewardship go beyond the formal
   curriculum and require a transformation in the informal educational
   system from one that almost exclusively focuses on medical discussions
   to one that also considers value and cost as part of medical
   decision-making. The HVCCC carriers propose a set of strategies and
   system adaptations that could aid the transformation toward a HVCCC
   supporting context.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Psychological resilience has been studied in several
   demanding professions, including the military and competitive sports,
   yet specific strategies for managing stress are not commonly addressed
   during surgical training. The objective of this study was to investigate
   how surgeons view performance under pressure during high-risk surgical
   steps.
   DESIGN: Using constructivist grounded theory, we conducted 12 individual
   semi-structured interviews with a theoretical sample teaching surgeons,
   representing 10 different specialties and a range of experience. We drew
   on Luthar's concept of resilience as positive adaptation, an active and
   flexible process in which critical choices are made in stressful
   situations. We asked about both protective and vulnerability factors
   contributing to resilience in high-risk surgery. We coded transcripts,
   transforming each category of codes into a visual schematic highlighting
   our findings related to performance under pressure and resilience, which
   we transformed into a conceptual model.
   SETTING: Truman Medical Center, Kansas City, MO, tertiary hospital.
   PARTICIPANTS: Twelve teaching surgeons from 10 different surgical
   specialties.
   RESULTS: Mental 3D visualization is necessary for proper preoperative
   planning, enacting contingency plans in the face of intra-operative
   challenges, and managing emotions during high-risk surgery. Each of
   these factors informs staying calm under pressure and is necessary for
   building long-term surgical resilience. Negotiating challenges in
   high-risk surgery is contingent upon adapting to risk developed over
   time through surgical experience, mental 3D visualization,
   intentionality, and self-reflection.
   CONCLUSIONS: Mental 3D visualization informs processes for staying calm
   under pressure and is essential for building long-term surgical
   resilience. We recommend that residency curricula offer progressive
   education on mental 3D visualization and foster intraoperative
   environments that promote adapting to risk. ((C) 2022 Association of

Title = {The PIER framework for healthcare simulation integration in
   undergraduate physiotherapy education},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Background The need for healthcare curricula renewal to facilitate a
   continuum in education from classrooms to diverse healthcare settings is
   undeniable. Simulation has been recognized as an educational strategy to
   address healthcare education challenges, with limited reporting on the
   integration of simulation-based learning experiences in physiotherapy
   education. The study aimed to describe the finalisation of a framework
   for integration of healthcare simulation in an undergraduate
   physiotherapy program. Methods A qualitative descriptive research design
   was utilized. Five South African experts in the fields of healthcare
   simulation and/or physiotherapy education contributed to the
   finalization of the framework during a consensus meeting. Content
   analysis was employed and credibility was ensured through double coding.
   Results Structural coding yielded five themes- Planning, Implementation,
   Program Evaluation, Program Revision and Framework. The five themes
   consisted of fifteen categories, two sub-categories and 44 codes. The
   planning theme was most robust with seven categories. The Planning,
   Implementation, Evaluation, Revision (PIER) framework was developed and
   finalized by expert participants. following the consensus meeting.
   Conclusion Needs analyses when planning and incorporating simulation is
   essential. Collaboration through resource and knowledge sharing is vital
   in developing a responsive curriculum integrating simulation.
   Furthermore, facilitator and student preparation are paramount in
   ensuring active engagement in simulated-based learning experiences. The
   interconnectedness of all framework elements and integration phases, as
   well as the implied importance of competent facilitators and prepared
   students is crucial and highlights careful consideration to be given to
   these aspects. The PIER framework is generic in nature and represents
   the continuous process of simulation integration for any healthcare
   program.},

Title = {Survey analysis to determine the impact of evidence informed practice
   education upon East Asian medicine faculty clinical instruction and
   students' skills, knowledge, attitudes and behaviors within a master's
   degree program},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},

Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {Background Between 2013 and 2018 Pacific College of Health and Science
   (formerly Pacific College of Oriental Medicine) trained faculty and
   developed curriculum in evidence informed practice (EIP), with support
   from a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). A
   three-credit (45 h) Foundations of EIP course, and online EIP learning
   modules (developed as part of a previous NIH R25 award), were used for
   faculty and student training. In addition, EIP was incorporated into
   73\% of the East Asian medicine degree program. Clinical integration of
   EIP in the College clinic was enhanced by improving access to reference
   sources, including additional EIP-related questions to the patient
   intake forms, requiring the use of a patient-centered outcome
   instrument, and assessing students' clinical EIP competencies. Methods
   Master's degree students' self-reported EIP skills, knowledge, attitudes
   and behaviors were assessed before and after taking the Foundations of
   EIP course using a 17-question paper-based survey with an additional
   open-ended comments section. The survey was administered in 29 courses
   across all three Pacific College campuses. Clinical faculty
   self-reported EIP instruction, focusing on the EIP content and
   instructional approaches that were utilized, was evaluated on the New
   York City campus using a paper-based survey before and after changes
   were made to enhance the clinical integration of EIP. Results A total of
   1181 completed EIP-course surveys consisting of 657 pre-EIP course
   surveys and 524 post-EIP course surveys were analyzed. There was a
   statistically significant improvement in students' EIP skills, knowledge
   and behaviors after completing the EIP course. Students' perception of
   the importance of EIP was high before and after the EIP course. Little
   change in Faculty's EIP-related clinical instruction was evident
   following the EIP-related changes that were made to the Clinic.
   Conclusion Our study suggests that the three-credit (45 h) EIP course
   was effective at improving the EIP skills, knowledge and behaviors of
   this group of East Asian medicine students who were undertaking a
   master's degree that qualified them for licensure in acupuncture in the
   US. These students also demonstrated a high level of recognition for the
   importance of research and EIP both before and after the course.
   Training faculty clinical supervisors and providing greater access to
   evidence sources in the College clinic did not appear to increase EIP
   instructional activity.},

   implemented an annual 1-day AIAN MSAW in 2018. The main objectives of
   the workshop are for participants to gain insights into the medical
   school application process; learn strategies to competitively apply;
   receive feedback on their personal statement and mock interviews; and
   discuss the medical school application process with AIAN faculty,
   admissions deans, and peer-mentors. Recruitment of AIAN participants
   occurred via email; social media; text messaging; medical association
   contacts; and AIAN and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
   organizations. Two surveys were administered: one immediately after and
   another 1-year after the workshop.ResultsForty AIAN MSAW participants
   were accepted in 2018-2020. Findings indicate statistically significant
   increases in participants' self-reported knowledge of the medical school
   application process and in their self-reported confidence. Participants
   reported meeting other AIAN students was highly beneficial and feeling
   connected to a community of AIAN health professionals after attending
   the workshop. Among the 25 participants who completed the 1-year
   follow-up survey, 12 (48.0\%) indicated applying to medical school; all
   12 of these participants were invited to interview, and 11 were offered
   acceptance to at least one medical school.ConclusionsCompleting the MSAW
   increased participants' knowledge, confidence, and sense of community.
   If other programs and institutions were to consider using the MSAW model
   to reduce barriers and provide supports specifically designed for AIANs
   before and during the medical school application process, medical
   schools may stand to further increase AIAN representation in the
   physician workforce and ultimately to decrease health inequities among
   AIANs.},

Title = {Establishing psychological safety in simulation: Faculty perceptions},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {91},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: A psychologically safe learning environment is defined as
   one where individuals feel comfortable to take interpersonal risks
   without fear of negative consequences. Despite knowledge of best
   practice for simulation, there is a lack of knowledge regarding how
   nursing faculty perceive and establish psychological safety in a
   simulated learning environment.
   Objectives: The purpose of this study was to explore nursing faculty's
   perceptions of psychological safety as it exists within a simulation
   learning environment for pre-licensure nursing students.
   Design: Mixed methods with online survey data collection.
   Settings/participants: Purposive sampling was used to recruit simulation
   nursing faculty who had previously participated in the National League
   for Nursing Leadership Development Program. Faculty were recruited from
   the United States and Canada.
   Methods: Data were collected using a series of open-ended questions
   through the online survey tool, SurveyGizmo. Content analysis was
   utilized to discover how faculty established psychological safety during
   the pre-brief, scenario, and debriefing phases of simulation. Three
   researchers independently, then collaboratively, reviewed the data,
   identifying themes and patterns across each phase.
   Results: Thirty-seven nursing faculty participated in the study. Across
   the phases of pre-brief, scenario, and debriefing, five themes emerged:
   (1) Setting the Stage; (2) It's ok, It's Simulation; (3) Everyone is
   Here to Learn; (4) Planned Strategies; and (5) Facilitator as Observer.
   Conclusions: Faculty perceive that they play a role in establishing a
   psychologically safe learning environment during all three phases of a
   simulation experience. Scenarios are purposefully designed to
   emotionally protect students while they participate in unfamiliar
   encounters. Strategies are implemented throughout all three phases to
   facilitate student risk-taking as part of the learning process. Faculty
   watch for verbal and non-verbal cues by students signaling a potentially
   psychologically unsafe learning environment, and intervene to protect
   them if necessary.},

Title = {Interrupting the cycle of bullying witnessed or experienced by nursing
   students: An ethical and relational action framework},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {91},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: The prevalence of bullying experienced by nursing students
   continues to be a substantial concern for the profession, especially for
   nurse educators. It is also an issue in other health care professional
   programs.
   Objectives: To explore how educational institutions address bullying
   experienced by nursing and other health care professional students, with
   the goal of creating a set of procedures for reporting bullying if
   students witness or experience it during their education.
   Design: Qualitative Description. Our central question was ``What
   processes and resources do faculty members use when students disclose an
   experience related to bullying?{''}
   Settings: Educational institutions in Western Canada.
   Participants: Nine faculty members and one staff member with a student
   service role from nursing and other health care profession programs.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews.
   Results: We found significant variation in interviewees' conceptions of
   bullying and the policies, processes, and resources for addressing
   bullying within programs. We adopted an existing definition of bullying;
   designed a set of procedures focused on reporting mechanisms; and
   developed a guiding framework entitled Addressing Bullying in Nursing
   Education: An Ethical and Relational Action Framework.
   Conclusions: Nursing and other health care professional programs should
   ensure they have 1) clear and transparent procedures to report bullying
   2) education about bullying for students and faculty.},

Abstract = {The evidence of suicide prevention training for nurses is scarce.
   Strategies to enhance general nurses' ability in suicide risk assessment
   are critical to develop effective training programs in general medical
   settings. This study was aimed to examine the effectiveness of an
   interactive discussion group in a suicide prevention training program
   for general nurses. In this randomized study with two groups of pre-post
   study design, the sample was recruited from the Medical. Surgical, and
   Emergency/Intensive Care Sectors of a 2000-bed general hospital via
   stratified randomization. Among the 111 nurses, 57 participants randomly
   assigned to the control group received a two-hour baseline suicide
   gatekeeper lecture, and 54 participants assigning to the experimental
   group received an additional five-hour group discussion about suicide
   risk assessment skills. Using a case vignette, the nurses discussed and
   assessed suicide risk factors specified in a 10-item Chinese SAD PERSONS
   Scale during a group discussion intervention. The findings revealed that
   the nurses achieved significant and consistent improvements of risk
   identification and assessment after the intervention without influencing
   their mental health status for assessing suicide risks. The result
   suggested an effective approach of interactive group discussion for
   facilitating critical thinking and learning suicide risk assessment
   skills among general nurses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Despite the growing success of machine learning for predicting
   structure-property relationships in molecules and materials, such as
   predicting the dielectric properties of polymers, it is still in its
   infancy. We report on the effectiveness of solving structure-property
   relationships for a computer-generated database of dielectric polymers
   using recurrent neural network (RNN) models. The implementation of a
   series of optimization strategies was crucial to achieving high learning
   speeds and sufficient accuracy: (1) binary and nonbinary representations
   of SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line System) fingerprints and (2)
   backpropagation with affine transformation of the input sequence
   (ATransformedBP) and resilient backpropagation with initial weight
   update parameter optimizations (iRPROP(-) optimized). For the
   investigated database of polymers, the binary SMILES representation was
   found to be superior to the decimal representation with respect to the
   training and prediction performance. All developed and optimized
   Elman-type RNN algorithms outperformed nonoptimized RNN models in the
   efficient prediction of nonlinear structure-activity relationships. The
   average relative standard deviation (RSD) remained well below 5\%, and
   the maximum RSD did not exceed 30\%. Moreover, we provide a C++ codebase
   as a testbed for a new generation of open programming languages that
   target increasingly diverse computer architectures.},

Title = {Factors contributing to undergraduate nursing students' satisfaction
   with a video assessment of clinical skills},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {84},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: Clinical skill assessment via Objective Structured Clinical
   Assessment (OSCA) has many challenges for undergraduate nursing
   students. These include high levels of anxiety that can compromise
   performance during the assessment, inconsistency with assessor
   reliability and is inconsistent with clinical skills performance in the
   real world. The implementation of a Video Assessment of Clinical Skills
   (VACS) that integrates formative feedback may be a way to address the
   challenges posed by OSCA assessment.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the acceptability,
   utility, and nursing student satisfaction with a formative feedback
   strategy - the Video Assessment of a Clinical Skill (VACS).
   Design: A cross sectional survey.
   Settings: Undergraduate Bachelor of Nursing degree students from a large
   Australian University.
   Participants: Third year undergraduate nursing students (final year)
   enrolled in a Bachelor of Nursing Program.
   Methods: Participants were recruited via purposive sampling. A
   pre-survey (prior to VACs assessment) and post-survey (after VACS
   assessment) were completed. This paper reports on the open-ended
   responses in the post-survey that explored students' insights and
   perceptions into formative feedback and its impact on their learning for
   the VACS assessment.
   Results: A total of 731 open-ended responses were analysed with findings
   being organised into 3 major themes; (i) Flexibility and reflexivity,
   (ii) Editing and repeated attempts, and (iii) Working together.
   Conclusions: Video Assessment of a Clinical Skill has demonstrated good
   utility, acceptability, and satisfaction among undergraduate nursing
   students.},

Abstract = {Motivation: Single-cell RNA-seq makes possible the investigation of
   variability in gene expression among cells, and dependence of variation
   on cell type. Statistical inference methods for such analyses must be
   scalable, and ideally interpretable.
   Results: We present an approach based on a modification of a recently
   published highly scalable variational autoencoder framework that
   provides interpretability without sacrificing much accuracy. We
   demonstrate that our approach enables identification of gene programs in
   massive datasets. Our strategy, namely the learning of factor models
   with the auto-encoding variational Bayes framework, is not domain
   specific and may be useful for other applications.},

Abstract = {For an unfamiliar Application Programming Interface (API), software
   developers often access the official documentation to learn its usage,
   and post questions related to this API on social question and answering
   (Q\&A) sites to seek solutions. The official software documentation
   often captures the information about functionality and parameters, but
   lacks detailed descriptions in different usage scenarios. On the
   contrary, the discussions about APIs on social Q\&A sites provide
   enriching usages. Moreover, existing code search engines and information
   retrieval systems cannot effectively return relevant software
   documentation when the issued query does not contain code snippets or
   API-like terms. In this paper, we present CnCxL2R, a software
   documentation recommendation strategy incorporating the content of
   official documentation and the social context on Q\&A into a
   learning-to-rank schema. In the proposed strategy, the content, local
   context and global context of documentation are considered to select
   candidate documents. Then four types of features are extracted to learn
   a ranking model. We conduct a large-scale automatic evaluation on Java
   documentation recommendation. The results show that CnCxL2R achieves
   state-of-the-art performance over the eight baseline models. We also
   compare the CnCxL2R with Google search. The results show that CnCxL2R
   can recommend more relevant software documentation, and can effectively
   capture the semantic between the high-level intent in developers'
   queries and the low-level implementation in software documentation.},

Title = {Multiobjective optimization of classifiers by means of 3D
   convex-hull-based evolutionary algorithms},

Abstract = {The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and detection error tradeoff
   (DET) curves are frequently used in the machine learning community to
   analyze the performance of binary classifiers. Recently, the
   convex-hull-based multiobjective genetic programming algorithm was
   proposed and successfully applied to maximize the convex hull area for
   binary classification problems by minimizing false positive rate and
   maximizing true positive rate at the same time using indicator-based
   evolutionary algorithms. The area under the ROC curve was used for the
   performance assessment and to guide the search. Here we extend this
   research and propose two major advancements: Firstly we formulate the
   algorithm in detection error tradeoff space, minimizing false positives
   and false negatives, with the advantage that misclassification cost
   tradeoff can be assessed directly. Secondly, we add complexity as an
   objective function, which gives rise to a 3D objective space (as opposed
   to a 2D previous ROC space). A domain specific performance indicator for
   3D Pareto front approximations, the volume above DET surface, is
   introduced, and used to guide the indicator -based evolutionary
   algorithm to find optimal approximation sets. We assess the performance
   of the new algorithm on designed theoretical problems with different
   geometries of Pareto fronts and DET surfaces, and two
   application-oriented benchmarks: (1) Designing spam filters with low
   numbers of false rejects, false accepts, and low computational cost
   using rule ensembles, and (2) finding sparse neural networks for binary
   classification of test data from the UCI machine learning benchmark. The
   results show a high performance of the new algorithm as compared to
   conventional methods for multicriteria optimization. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {In the process of computer network communication, there is usually the
   situation of measuring the instability of data transmission within a
   specified time, which is the problem of bit error rate (BER). In order
   to transmit information accurately and reliably, the communication is
   more secure and the signal is more stable. In general, the corresponding
   error control measures in the communication network will be taken.
   Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) algorithm is an effective method to detect
   network communication errors. In this paper, the application of cyclic
   redundancy check in computer network communication error detection and
   control is studied. The proposed CRC algorithm can reduce the error rate
   of the system by detecting and controlling the errors. In addition, we
   analyse the principle of CRC algorithm, check rules and the
   understanding of algorithm programming idea in detail. Finally, the
   application of CRC algorithm in computer network communication error
   detection and control is discussed, and the validity of CRC algorithm is
   verified by experiments.},

Abstract = {While the United States federal government and the main teacher
   education accreditation organization push for the inclusion of
   technology in teacher education across the curriculum, little attention
   has been paid to understanding the technology competencies and behaviors
   of teacher educators. This study explores this gap by investigating what
   direct and mediating factors predict technological pedagogical content
   knowledge (TPACK) in teacher educators, and how these factors along with
   TPACK influence the adoption of the ISTE technology standards in teacher
   education. The findings from a sample of 806 teacher educators across
   the United States indicate that there are significant differences in
   both TPACK and ISTE standard alignment across subject areas, and that
   experience levels positively predict ISTE standard alignment to a small
   degree. More significant, however, is the finding that technology
   knowledge and institutional support are important mediators, predicting
   TPACK and ISTE standard alignment. Additionally, TPACK strongly predicts
   ISTE standard alignment. These findings suggest that institutions should
   provide targeted support to teacher educators across disciplines and
   should adopt coherent technology frameworks for their programs.},

Abstract = {Various programs effectively teach children to cross streets more
   safely, but all are labor- and cost-intensive. Recent developments in
   mobile phone technology offer opportunity to deliver virtual reality
   pedestrian environments to mobile smartphone platforms. Such an
   environment may offer a cost- and labor-effective strategy to teach
   children to cross streets safely. This study evaluated usability,
   feasibility, and validity of a smartphone-based virtual pedestrian
   environment. A total of 68 adults completed 12 virtual crossings within
   each of two virtual pedestrian environments, one delivered by smartphone
   and the other a semi-immersive kiosk virtual environment. Participants
   completed self-report measures of perceived realism and simulator
   sickness experienced in each virtual environment, plus self-reported
   demographic and personality characteristics. All participants followed
   system instructions and used the smartphone-based virtual environment
   without difficulty. No significant simulator sickness was reported or
   observed. Users rated the smartphone virtual environment as highly
   realistic. Convergent validity was detected, with many aspects of
   pedestrian behavior in the smartphone-based virtual environment matching
   behavior in the kiosk virtual environment. Anticipated correlations
   between personality and kiosk virtual reality pedestrian behavior
   emerged for the smartphone-based system. A smartphone-based virtual
   environment can be usable and valid. Future research should develop and
   evaluate such a training system.},

Abstract = {Background Despite the critical role of faculty diversity in the
   persistence and academic experiences of undergraduate students as well
   as in the development of engineering innovations, women of color (WoC)
   faculty are still underrepresented in engineering programs across the
   United States. Purpose/Hypothesis This study identifies whether the
   demographic composition of undergraduate engineering students is
   correlated with the representation of WoC faculty. It also highlights
   the institutional- and departmental-level factors that contribute to the
   race-gender diversification of the engineering professoriate.
   Design/Method Informed by organizational demography as the theoretical
   framework, the methods include linear and logit regression analyses.
   Data come from the American Society for Engineering Education, the
   Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, and the American
   Community Survey, and include engineering departmental-level
   observations across 345 institutions over 12 years. Results Engineering
   departments that award more bachelor's degrees to women African
   American/Black undergraduate students are more likely to employ
   relatively more African American/Black women faculty. This positive
   relationship is also found among Asian Americans and Hispanics/Latinas.
   Conclusions Research findings demonstrate the relationship between
   engineering undergraduate composition, as well as other departmental-
   and institutional-level factors, and the prevalence of WoC faculty. The
   findings highlight important areas for stakeholders and academic
   administrators to consider when developing strategies and programs to
   diversify the composition of engineering faculty.},

Abstract = {Context During the development process of a software program, regression
   testing is used to ensure that the correct behavior of the software is
   retained after updates to the source code. This regression testing
   becomes costly over time as the number of test cases increases and it
   makes sense to prioritize test cases in order to execute fault-detecting
   test cases as soon as possible. There are many coverage-based test case
   prioritization (TCP) methods that only use the code coverage data to
   prioritize test cases. By incorporating the fault-proneness estimations
   of code units into the coverage-based TCP methods, we can improve such
   techniques.
   Objective: In this paper, we aim to propose an approach which improves
   coverage-based TCP methods by considering the fault-proneness
   distribution over code units. Further, we present the results of an
   empirical study that shows using our proposed approach significantly
   improves the additional strategy, which is a widely used coverage-based
   TCP method.
   Method: The approach presented in this study uses the bug history of the
   software in order to introduce a defect prediction method to learn a
   neural network model. This model is then used to estimate
   fault-proneness of each area of the source code and then the estimations
   are incorporated into coverage-based TCP methods. Our proposed approach
   is a general idea that can be applied to many coverage-based methods,
   such as the additional and total TCP methods.
   Results: The proposed methods are evaluated on datasets collected from
   the development history of five real-world projects including 357
   versions in total. The experiments show that using an appropriate bug
   history can improve coverage-based TCP methods.
   Conclusion: The proposed approach can be applied to various
   coverage-based TCP methods and the experiments show that it can improve
   these methods by incorporating estimations of code units
   fault-proneness.},

Abstract = {Explaining physics content in an understandable way has been described
   as a vital skill for physics teachers in schools and universities.
   Studies suggest that physics teacher trainees regard explanation as one
   of the hardest challenges of their profession, and many scholars argue
   that explanation should be a part of physics teacher education. This
   paper presents an online test instrument for physics explanatory skills.
   It has been developed for diagnostic purposes and can be used-among
   other things-for teacher training and self-assessment (available via a
   weblink). The test takes about 45 min and calculates a score for
   explanatory skills as well as an indicator for underlying reasoning
   strategies. The individual results are compared with average scores from
   a study with physicists involved in science communication and physics
   teacher trainees. This comparison allows an estimation of the
   participants' skill to explain physics content successfully and gives
   hints on how to improve. The test consists of video scenes which show a
   teacher in the attempt to explain a physics phenomenon to a student.
   When the student asks a question, the video stops and the participant
   has to decide how to continue. Afterwards, he or she is asked to reason
   the choice made. The dialogue continues with the next video scene. In
   this paper, we summarise findings on how a science teaching explanation
   should be provided and discuss how the test instrument covers these
   aspects. Findings from a study with N = 154 participants are briefly
   discussed to show evidence for the validity of the instrument. Finally,
   possible uses of the test are proposed, including (self-)assessment,
   physics teacher education, and evaluation of training programs for all
   those who are involved in explaining physics.},

Title = {Scut to Scholarship: Can Operative Notes be Educationally Useful?},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Efforts to implement competency-based medical education
   require new sources of workplace based evidence of growth in learning.
   We used qualitative analysis of operative notes to explore procedural
   variation in a simple surgical procedure.
   DESIGN: We used a grounded theory-based mixed methods approach to depict
   intersurgeon procedural variation. Our grounded theory approach to
   analysis included follow up interviews with surgeons and residents to
   probe their understandings of the reasons for variation in the dictated
   notes and the current and potential utility of operative notes as a
   reliable source of data for learning and assessment.
   SETTING: Publicly funded tertiary care otolaryngology head \& neck
   surgery residency program in Ontario, Canada
   PARTICIPANTS: Using maximum variability sampling, all surgeons
   performing tonsillectomy in the department (n = 6) contributed operative
   notes from 65 tonsillectomies, 5 intraoperative observations, and 4 semi
   -structured interviews. An additional 3 residents from various levels of
   training contributed semistructured interviews.
   RESULTS: Intersurgeon procedural variations persist even in simple
   surgical procedures such as tonsillectomy. Operative notes appear to
   capture procedural variations in a limited way. Surgeons and resident
   make informal educational use of the clerical work of writing and
   assessing operative notes, but optimization will be required to shift
   such hidden work into the formal educational domain.
   CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of competency based medical education
   requires surgical educators to both eliminate low-yield tasks for
   learning and to find new opportunities for multiple low-stakes
   assessment. Analysis of operative notes may become a high-yield strategy
   for learning and assessment if residents and surgeons are coached to use
   operative notes more reliably and efficiently. (C) 2020 Association of

Abstract = {The emergence of OpenFlow-capable switches enables exciting new network
   functionality, at the risk of programming errors that make communication
   less reliable. The centralized programming model, where a single
   controller program manages the network, seems to reduce the likelihood
   of bugs. However, the system is inherently distributed and asynchronous,
   with events happening at different switches and end hosts, and
   inevitable delays affecting communication with the controller. In this
   paper, we present efficient, systematic techniques for testing
   unmodified controller programs. Our NICE tool applies model checking to
   explore the state space of the entire system the controller, the
   switches, and the hosts. Scalability is the main challenge, given the
   diversity of data packets, the large system state, and the many possible
   event orderings. To addressthis, we propose a novel way to augment model
   checking with symbolic execution of event handlers (to identify
   representative packets that exercise code paths on the controller). We
   also present a simplified OpenFlow switch model (to reduce the state
   space), and effective strategies for generating event interleavings
   likely to uncover bugs. Our prototype tests Python applications on the
   popular NOX platform. In testing three real applications-a MAC-learning
   switch, in-network server load balancing, and energy-efficient traffic
   engineering-we uncover 13 bugs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Writing Multiple Choice Questions-Has the Student Become the Master?},
Journal = {TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 MAR 5},
Abstract = {Construct We compared the quality of clinician-authored and
   student-authored multiple choice questions (MCQs) using a formative,
   mock examination of clinical knowledge for medical students. Background
   Multiple choice questions are a popular format used in medical programs
   of assessment. A challenge for educators is creating high-quality items
   efficiently. For expediency's sake, a standard practice is for faculties
   to repeat items in examinations from year to year. This study aims to
   compare the quality of student-authored with clinician-authored items as
   a potential source of new items to include in faculty item banks.
   Approach We invited Year IV and V medical students at the University of
   Adelaide to participate in a mock examination. The participants first
   completed an online instructional module on strategies for answering and
   writing MCQs, then submitted one original MCQ each for potential
   inclusion in the mock examination. Two 180-item mock examinations, one
   for each year level, were constructed. Each consisted of 90
   student-authored items and 90 clinician-authored items. Participants
   were blinded to the author of each item. Each item was analyzed for item
   difficulty and discrimination, number of item-writing flaws (IWFs) and
   non-functioning distractors (NFDs), and cognitive skill level (using a
   modified version of Bloom's taxonomy). Findings Eighty-nine and 91
   students completed the Year IV and V examinations, respectively.
   Student-authored items, compared with clinician-authored items, tended
   to be written at both a lower cognitive skill and difficulty level. They
   contained a significantly higher rate of IWFs (2-3.5 times) and NFDs
   (1.18 times). However, they were equally or better discriminating items
   than clinician-authored items. Conclusions Students can author MCQ items
   with comparable discrimination to clinician-authored items, despite
   being inferior in other parameters. Student-authored items may be
   considered a potential source of material for faculty item banks;
   however, several barriers exist to their use in a summative setting. The
   overall quality of items remains suboptimal, regardless of author. This
   highlights the need for ongoing faculty training in item writing.},

Abstract = {Clinician educators often experience distress caused by uncertainty
   regarding how effectively to participate in assessment practices in a
   way that supports both their programs and their students. Uncertainty is
   a common state for clinicians, particularly for those who see patients
   with early or ill-defined illness presentations. While clinicians often
   feel ill at ease when facing uncertainty in the clinical realm, becoming
   comfortable with uncertainty and learning to manage such states are now
   recognized as vital components of clinical practice. Clinicians, as a
   result, have adopted a series of strategies to lessen the unease that
   uncertainty can create. While similar experiences plague clinician
   educators placed in assessment roles, much less attention has been given
   to how we can support individuals in the education setting. Here, the
   distress of uncertainty may be greater due to clinician educators having
   less experience with assessment practices. Fortunately, strategies that
   are effective in the clinical domain can be translated into the
   assessment realm to accommodate uncertainty when assessing learners. In
   this 12 tips article we offer guidance on the translation of such
   strategies.},

Title = {Identifying and Supporting Students to Prevent USMLE Step 1 Failures
   When Testing Follows Clerkships: Insights From 9 Schools},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {95},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1338-1345},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Several schools have moved the United States Medical Licensing
   Examination Step 1 exam after core clerkships, and others are
   considering this change. Delaying Step 1 may improve Step 1 performance
   and lower Step 1 failure rates. Schools considering moving Step 1 are
   particularly concerned about late identification of struggling students
   and late Step failures, which can be particularly problematic due to
   reduced time to remediate and accumulated debt if remediation is
   ultimately unsuccessful. In the literature published to date, little
   attention has been given to these students. In this article, authors
   from 9 medical schools with a postclerkship Step 1 exam share their
   experiences. The authors describe curricular policies, early warning and
   identification strategies, and interventions to enhance success for all
   students and struggling students in particular. Such learners can be
   identified by understanding challenges that place them ``at risk{''} and
   by tracking performance outcomes, particularly on other standardized
   assessments. All learners can benefit from early coaching and advising,
   mechanisms to ensure early feedback on performance, commercial study
   tools, learning specialists or resources to enhance learning skills, and
   wellness programs. Some students may need intensive tutoring,
   neuropsychological testing and exam accommodations, board preparation
   courses, deceleration pathways, and options to postpone Step 1. In rare
   instances, a student may need a compassionate off-ramp from medical
   school. With the National Board of Medical Examiner's announcement that
   Step 1 scoring will change to pass/fail as early as January 2022,
   residency program directors might use failing Step 1 scores to screen
   out candidates. Institutions altering the timing of Step 1 can benefit
   from practical guidance by those who have made the change, to both
   prevent Step 1 failures and minimize adverse effects on those who fail.},

Title = {Perceptions of portfolio assessment in family medicine graduates: a
   qualitative interview study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 30},
Abstract = {Background: The use of the portfolio methodology in medical education
   can serve as a tool for learning, assessment, and reflection on
   practice. This study concentrates on perceptions of the portfolio
   assessment methodology among participants in the Saudi Diploma of Family
   Medicine program. Methods: In this qualitative interview study, data
   were collected and analysed using a grounded theory approach. Results:
   Nine codes emerged: (1) Importance of understanding the definition,
   objectives, and process of portfolio assessment, (2) Impact of different
   understandings on the part of various trainers, (3) Role of the type of
   assessment, (4) Workload and stress of portfolio assessment, (5)
   Effectiveness of the portfolio contents, (6) Role of the mentor's
   feedback, (7) Role in the learning process, (8) Role in practice, (9)
   Suggestions for portfolio improvement. Open codes were then regrouped
   into three axial codes: context, strategy, and outcome of portfolio
   assessment. Conclusion: This study explored a general explanation of
   portfolio assessment shaped by the postgraduate students. It identifies
   the importance of portfolio understanding in student acceptability of
   the portfolio assessment methodology. Thus, proper implementation is
   vital for the success of assessing the student by the portfolio
   methodology. The students perceived reflection as the most valuable part
   of the process, which facilitated their learning, confidence, and
   self-assessment. Mentor feedback is a good strategy for coping with
   portfolio challenges. Our findings provide some evidence of positive
   outcomes of portfolio assessment in practice and professional
   development.},

Title = {Scenario cluster Lagrangean decomposition for risk averse in multistage
   stochastic optimization},

Abstract = {In this work we present a decomposition approach as a mixture of
   dualization and Lagrangean Relaxation for obtaining strong lower bounds
   on large-sized multistage stochastic mixed 0-1 programs with a time
   stochastic dominance risk averse measure. The objective function to
   minimize is a composite function of the expected cost along the time
   horizon over the scenarios and the penalization of the expected cost
   excess on reaching the set of thresholds under consideration, subject to
   a bound on the expected cost excess for each threshold and a bound on
   the failure probability of reaching it. The main differences with some
   other risk averse strategies are presented. The problem is represented
   by a mixture of the splitting representation up to a given stage,
   so-called break stage, and the compact representation for the other
   stages along the time horizon. The dualization of the nonanticipativity
   constraints for the node-based and risk averse variables up to the break
   stage and the Lagrangean Relaxation of the cross node constraints of the
   risk averse strategy result in a model that can be decomposed into a set
   of independent scenario cluster submodels. Three Lagrangean multipliers
   updating schemes as the Subgradient method, the Lagrangean Progressive
   Hedging algorithm and the Dynamic Constrained Cutting Plane are
   computationally compared. We have observed in the randomly generated
   instances we have experimented with that the smaller the number of
   clusters, the stronger the lower bound provided for the original problem
   (even, frequently, it is the solution value) obtained with an affordable
   computing time. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Twelve tips for crossborder curriculum partnerships in medical education},
Journal = {MEDICAL TEACHER},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {40},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {514-519},
Abstract = {Crossborder curriculum partnerships are a relatively new and
   fast-growing form of internationalization in which the curriculum that
   has been developed by one institution (the home institution) crosses
   borders and is implemented in another institution (the host
   institution). These partnerships aim to provide comparable learning
   experiences to the students in both institutions and are driven by a
   variety of motives, such as strengthening international networks,
   increasing financial gains, and stimulating research spinoffs. Although
   popular, crossborder curriculum partnerships are also criticized for
   their potentially low educational quality, failing to address
   fundamental differences in teaching and learning between the home and
   host institutions, and not addressing the educational needs of the host
   country's health care system. Our aim is to provide guidance to those
   considering or engaged in designing, developing, managing, and reviewing
   a crossborder curriculum partnership or other forms of international
   educational partnerships in medical education. Drawing from research,
   personal, and institutional experiences in this area, we listed twelve
   tips categorized into four themes, which contribute to the establishment
   of sustainable partnerships that can withstand the aforementioned
   criticism.},

Abstract = {Despite calls for including content on climate change and its effect on
   health in curricula across the spectrum of medical education, no widely
   used resource exists to guide residency training programs in this
   effort. This lack of resources poses challenges for training program
   leaders seeking to incorporate evidence-based climate and health content
   into their curricula. Climate change increases risks of heat-related
   illness, infections, asthma, mental health disorders, poor perinatal
   outcomes, adverse experiences from trauma and displacement, and other
   harms. More numerous and increasingly dangerous natural disasters caused
   by climate change impair delivery of care by disrupting supply chains
   and compromising power supplies. Graduating trainees face a knowledge
   gap in understanding, managing, and mitigating these many-faceted
   consequences of climate change, which-expected to intensify in coming
   decades-will influence both the health of their patients and the health
   care they deliver. In this article, the authors propose a framework of
   climate change and health educational content for residents, including
   how climate change (1) harms health, (2) necessitates adaptation in
   clinical practice, and (3) undermines health care delivery. The authors
   propose not only learning objectives linked to the Accreditation Council
   for Graduate Medical Education core competencies for resident education
   but also learning formats and assessment strategies in each content
   area. They also present opportunities for implementation of climate and
   health education in residency training programs. Including this content
   in residency education will better prepare doctors to deliver
   anticipatory guidance to at-risk patients, manage those experiencing
   climate-related health effects, and reduce care disruptions during
   climate-driven extreme weather events.},

Title = {Prioritizing data flows and sinks for app security transformation},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {92},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {There have been extensive investigations on identifying sensitive data
   flows in Android apps for detecting malicious behaviors. Typical real
   world apps have a large number of sensitive flows and sinks. Thus,
   security analysts need to prioritize these flows and data sinks
   according to their risks, i.e., flow ranking and sink ranking. In this
   paper, we present an efficient graph-algorithm based risk metric for
   prioritizing risky flows and sinks in Android grayware apps. The new
   risk metric is quantitative and can differentiate the sensitivities of
   flows and sinks in an app. In the experiments, our risk prioritization
   produces orderings that are highly consistent with manual inspection. To
   enable post-detection security enforcement of sensitive sinks, we also
   present an automatic rewriting framework that utilizes the above
   prioritization technique. Our rewriting strategies are more feasible
   than the state-of-art solutions by supporting flow-and sink-based
   rewriting. We implement our prototype as ReDroid. ReDroid is designed
   for security analysts who manage organizational app repositories and
   customize third-party apps to satisfy organization imposed security
   requirements. We use ReDroid to rewrite both benchmark apps and real
   world grayware. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A group of surgeons and a medical educator constructed a
   curriculum to strengthen communication and emotional intelligence skills
   in the surgical setting.
   DESIGN: The curriculum consisted of a small group discussion series
   occurring during medical students' eight-week surgery clerkship. The
   curriculum targeted the following objectives: building team rapport,
   exploring self-management strategies in team communication, recognizing
   communication styles, diagnosing conflict, identifying opportunities in
   professional and personal development, and discussing professionalism in
   medicine. Students completed pre-post Likert style tests about their
   knowledge and understanding of the above-mentioned topics.
   SETTING: Texas A\&M University College of Medicine, Surgical Clerkship
   at Baylor Scott and White Medical Center, a level 1 trauma center, in
   Temple, TX.
   PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four students in their third year of medical school
   completed the communication curriculum.
   RESULTS: Wilcoxon sign test was used to analyze the non-parametric data
   and multiple repeat tests required the significance level (p-Value) be
   adjusted to 0.003. Students showed significant increase in understanding
   of conflict management, their ability to communicate effectively, and
   their awareness of communication preferences (p < 0.001). In addition,
   they recognized better ways to engage with other students, residents,
   and staff on their rotation (p = 0.002) and felt more confident in their
   ability to handle feedback (p = 0.001). Open-ended responses on the
   post-test had overwhelmingly positive feedback with themes of awareness,
   psychological safety, and team rapport. Finally, students requested that
   the curriculum be taught longitudinally throughout their third-year
   clerkships.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our curriculum enabled students to improve their awareness
   of communication, conflict management, team dynamics, and
   professionalism. These important competencies will support students
   throughout their training and in their practice as future surgeons. (C)

Title = {Weighting Estimation Methods for Opponents' Utility Functions Using
   Boosting in Multi-Time Negotiations},

Abstract = {Recently, multi-issue closed negotiations have attracted attention in
   multi-agent systems. In particular, multi-time and multilateral
   negotiation strategies are important topics in multi-issue closed
   negotiations. In multi-issue closed negotiations, an automated
   negotiating agent needs to have strategies for estimating an opponent's
   utility function by learning the opponent's behaviors since the
   opponent's utility information is not open to others. However, it is
   difficult to estimate an opponent's utility function for the following
   reasons: (1) Training datasets for estimating opponents' utility
   functions cannot be obtained. (2) It is difficult to apply the learned
   model to different negotiation domains and opponents. In this paper, we
   propose a novel method of estimating the opponents' utility functions
   using boosting based on the least-squares method and nonlinear
   programming. Our proposed method weights each utility function estimated
   by several existing utility function estimation methods and outputs
   improved utility function by summing each weighted function. The
   existing methods using boosting are based on the frequency-based method,
   which counts the number of values offered, considering the time elapsed
   when they offered. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
   accuracy of estimating opponents' utility functions is significantly
   improved under various conditions compared with the existing utility
   function estimation methods without boosting.},

Title = {Bridging the Gap between Sexual Health Education and Clinical Services:
   Adolescent Perspectives and Recommendations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SCHOOL HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {91},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND Adolescents often lack access to accurate and appropriate
   sexual health information and services. Providing information about
   local clinical services during sexual health education classes is one
   strategy to increase awareness, yet many programs miss this opportunity.
   This study aims to learn about adolescents' experiences with sexual
   health education and their perceptions of barriers and facilitators to
   clinical care. METHODS Nine focus groups were conducted between April to
   July 2018 with 69 adolescents who had recently attended a comprehensive
   sexual health education program in California. Topics included
   information received about local clinics during class and barriers and
   facilitators to access care. Qualitative data were coded and analyzed
   for key themes and compared by sex and geographic location. RESULTS The
   majority of participants (89\%) were Latino and most reported receiving
   relevant information about clinical services and had positive
   impressions of local services. Several mentioned that this information
   increased the likelihood that they would access services if needed.
   Common barriers to clinic services included parental disapproval,
   stigma, embarrassment, and confidentiality concerns. Facilitators
   included peer and family support, confidentiality of services, awareness
   and education, and accessibility. CONCLUSIONS Sexual health education
   programs can provide an important bridge to local clinic services and
   address adolescents' concerns.},

   sexual orientation (SO) and gender identity (GI) diversity could help
   reduce health disparities among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender
   (LGBT) patients. The authors share the University of California, Davis,
   Health System's (UCDHS's) experience as it became the first U.S.
   academic health center to formally introduce patient SO/GI demographic
   data into its electronic health record (EHR) as a step toward reducing
   LGBT health disparities. Adding these data to the EHR initially met with
   resistance. The authors, members of the UCDHS Task Force for Inclusion
   of SO/GI in the EHR, viewed this resistance as an invitation to educate
   leaders, providers, and staff about LGBT health disparities and to
   expose providers to techniques for discussing SO/GI with patients. They
   describe the strategies they employed to effect institutional culture
   change, including involvement of senior leadership, key informant
   interviews, educational outreach via grand rounds and resident
   workshops, and creation of a patient safety net through inviting
   providers to self-identify as welcoming LGBT patients. The ongoing
   cultural change process has inspired spin-off projects contributing to
   an improved climate for LGBT individuals at UCDHS, including an employee
   organization supporting SO/GI diversity, support for and among LGBT
   medical learners through events and listservs, development and
   implementation of an LGBT health curriculum, and creation of peer
   navigator programs for LGBT patients with cancer. The authors reflect on
   lessons learned and on institutional pride in and commitment to
   providing quality care for LGBT patients.},

Abstract = {The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the important role
   veterinarians play as public health communicators and emphasized the
   importance of engaging veterinary students in epidemiology and public
   health curriculum, the majority of whom have a clinical focus and
   struggle to see their relevance in relation to future career plans.To
   enhance student engagement, second-year DVM students were asked to
   create a one-page risk communication handout centered on a zoonotic
   disease and organized with public health message mapping. Informed by
   the distribution of students' self-declared career plans at admission to
   the DVM program, students were asked to choose from a list of zoonotic
   pathogens previously covered in the DVM curriculum and to select a
   relevant focus species and expected lay audience member.This assignment
   was scaffolded with previous infectious disease and communication
   coursework and provided an opportunity for all students to engage with
   public health material regardless of prior interest or knowledge.
   Students chose 13 of 15 zoonotic diseases provided, and their species
   and audience focuses were distributed across previously stated career
   focuses, including companion animals, food producing animals, exotic
   animals, and wildlife. Providing options relevant to diverse student
   experiences and connecting the assignment to clinical competencies
   supported student autonomy and engagement in public health content
   outside clinically focused core classes. Students' successful delivery
   of constructive peer feedback indicated their engagement with the public
   health course material, integration of learning from other parts of the
   curriculum, and perceived relevance of the assignment to their future
   career focus.},

Abstract = {Anatomical sciences are foundational to the health professions, yet
   little is known about the qualifications of anatomy educators at the
   graduate and professional level in the United States. Moreover, there is
   concern that the number of qualified anatomy educators being trained may
   be insufficient to meet the growing demand posed by new and expanded
   programs in medicine and allied health specialties. The authors surveyed
   anatomists from across the country to (i) characterize the educational
   credentials of current anatomy educators and (ii) assess the perceived
   need for education-focused postdoctoral positions or formal mentorships
   to prepare anatomists for teaching-intensive faculty positions. To probe
   the survey responses more deeply, one-on-one interviews were conducted
   with eight individuals selected to represent a diverse sample of
   respondents in terms of institution, gender, and academic rank. Results
   indicate that 30-40\% of educators at the graduate level and
   approximately 60\% of those at the undergraduate level lack graduate
   coursework in histology, embryology, and neuroanatomy. Forty-five
   percent of respondents had completed a postdoctoral fellowship.
   Eighty-six percent replied yes/maybe to the question of whether an
   anatomy education postdoctoral fellowship would benefit doctoral
   graduates. The top 3 reasons for this recommendation were to (i)
   establish independent educational research, (ii) improve a publication
   record, and (iii) gain additional teaching experience. Notable
   weaknesses of education-focused postdoctoral training were related to
   finances, fear of exploitation, and undervaluing of teaching. Moving
   forward, postdoctoral fellowships and other forms of postgraduate
   training may represent a key strategy for training anatomists in the
   current educational climate. Anat Sci Educ 00: 000-000. (c) 2018

Title = {Debating the Effectiveness and Necessity of Tenure in Pharmacy Education},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {80},
Number = {6},
Abstract = {Academic tenure is a controversial and highly debated topic. Is tenure
   truly outdated or does it simply need to be reformed? On one hand, the
   tenure system has shortcomings including deincentivizing productive
   faculty members, inconsistent application of tenure policies and
   procedures, and the potential for discrimination during tenure
   decisions. On the other hand, the tenure system is a long held tradition
   in the academy, essential in higher education to ensure academic
   standards and values are upheld in the best interest of students. It
   provides faculty members with the academic freedom to try innovative
   teaching strategies and conduct research and assists with faculty
   retention and recruitment. Regardless of one's opinion, the tenure
   debate is not going away and warrants further discussion. This paper
   represents the work of a group of academic leaders participating in the
   2014-2015 AACP Academic Leadership Fellowship Program. This work was
   presented as a debate at the 2015 AACP Interim Meeting in Austin, TX in
   February 2015.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a stochastic algorithm for virtual network service
   mapping in virtualized network infrastructures, based on reinforcement
   learning (RL). An exact mapping algorithm in line with the current state
   of the art and based on integer linear programming is proposed as well,
   and the performances of the two algorithms are compared. While most of
   the current works in literature report exact or heuristic mapping
   methods, the RL algorithm presented here is instead a stochastic one,
   based on Markov decision processes theory. The aim of the RL algorithm
   is to iteratively learn an efficient mapping policy, which could
   maximize the expected mapping reward in the long run. Based on the
   review of the state of the art, the paper presents a general model of
   the service mapping problem and the mathematical formulation of the 2
   proposed strategies. The distinctive features of the 2 algorithms, their
   strengths, and possible drawbacks are discussed and validated by means
   of numeric simulations in a realistic emulated environment.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-52},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background/Purpose: Physical education teacher education (PETE) programs
   have experienced enrollment decline, leading some PETE faculty to
   consider increasing efforts to recruit new students to their programs.
   This aspect of the current study sought to investigate PETE program
   coordinators' perceptions of possible causes for decreased PETE
   enrollments as well as their role in, and barriers to, recruiting
   preservice teachers. Methods: Thirty-six PETE program coordinators (12
   males and 24 females) participated in in-depth interviews. The data were
   coded using a standard interpretative approach grounded in inductive
   analysis and constant comparison. Results: PETE faculty members
   perceived declining enrollments to be related to negative public
   perceptions of education, low-quality K-12 physical education,
   academically unprepared PETE students, and restructuring programs to
   emphasize other kinesiology areas. Though compelled to recruit, PETE
   coordinators questioned their responsibility to do so and reported
   lacking time and training to be effective. Discussion/Conclusions: PETE
   coordinators favor recruiting strategies that are less time-intensive
   and match their academic skill set.},

Title = {Vigilante Innovation (VIX): case study on the development of student
   skills through a team-based design process and environment},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Background: Many undergraduate students majoring in science, technology,
   engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields lack experience in
   collaborative thinking, limiting their effectiveness as they enter
   careers in academic and industrial environments. The SyBBURE Searle
   Undergraduate Research Program has incorporated a team-based design
   component into its curriculum to fill this gap in training. This design
   framework, called Vigilante Innovation (VIX) to highlight its emphasis
   on self-initiation and action, has evolved into a multi-semester-long
   group undertaking that combines just-in-time training in
   entrepreneurship and project design with student-driven collaborations
   aimed at solving a real-world problem. We hypothesize that this
   framework provides a hands-on, realistic workplace simulation task
   through which students can develop an understanding of teamwork.
   Results: Using a case-study approach, we discuss the development of the
   VIX design framework since its inception in 2014 and assess the impact
   of the VIX framework on student learning and growth using a student
   survey from 2016 to 2017 and student interviews from 2018.
   Conclusions: A flexible approach, an annualized project timeline, a
   student-driven prototyping space, and self-selecting project areas
   emerged as key contributors to the successful implementation of the VIX
   design and to deepened student learning. The diversity of VIX teams, the
   self-reported success of student projects, and student interviews
   indicate that students who participate in VIX possess an in-depth
   understanding of team-based strategies. These findings support the VIX
   framework as an effective method of providing undergraduates in STEM
   fields with efficient and meaningful exposure to the team-based
   entrepreneurial skills that are vital in their future careers.
   Additional work is needed to determine if this approach has a long-term
   impact on student success in team-based environments. The website

Title = {Afraid of Being ``Witchy With a `B'{''}: A Qualitative Study of How
   Gender Influences Residents' Experiences Leading Cardiopulmonary
   Resuscitation},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {89},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1276-1281},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Purpose
   Ineffective leadership during cardiopulmonary resuscitation
   ({''}code{''}) can negatively affect a patient's likelihood of survival.
   In most teaching hospitals, internal medicine residents lead codes. In
   this study, the authors explored internal medicine residents'
   experiences leading codes, with a particular focus on how gender
   influences the code leadership experience.
   Method
   The authors conducted individual, semistructured telephone or in-person
   interviews with 25 residents (May 2012 to February 2013) from 9 U.S.
   internal medicine residency programs. They audio recorded and
   transcribed the interviews and then thematically analyzed the
   transcribed text.
   Results
   Participants viewed a successful code as one with effective leadership.
   They agreed that the ideal code leader was an authoritative presence;
   spoke with a deep, loud voice; used clear, direct communication; and
   appeared calm. Although equally able to lead codes as their male
   colleagues, female participants described feeling stress from having to
   violate gender behavioral norms in the role of code leader. In response,
   some female participants adopted rituals to signal the suspension of
   gender norms while leading a code. Others apologized afterwards for
   their counternormative behavior.
   Conclusions
   Ideal code leadership embodies highly agentic, stereotypical male
   behaviors. Female residents employed strategies to better integrate the
   competing identities of code leader and female gender. In the future,
   residency training should acknowledge how female gender stereotypes may
   conflict with the behaviors required to enact code leadership and offer
   some strategies, such as those used by the female residents in this
   study, to help women integrate these dual identities.},

Title = {Breaking Down Barriers to Pharmacy Graduate Education: The Report of the

Abstract = {EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
   The 2017-2018 Research and Graduate Affairs Committee (RGAC) was given
   three charges aimed at helping academic pharmacy address barriers that
   must be overcome by both students and schools to attract, retain, and
   support the development of a diverse, well-rounded, and successful
   graduate student population. These charges were (1) identifying teaching
   methodologies, tools and opportunities that graduate programs can
   introduce into curriculum to overcome barriers to success of today's and
   tomorrow's learners; (2) developing a strategy for achieving member
   support of the 2016-2017 recommended graduate competencies by
   identifying gaps in and existing examples of courses or opportunities
   that achieve competency-based pharmacy graduate education; and (3)
   identifying potential strategies to address identified barriers to
   pursuing graduate education, especially among under-represented student
   populations. This report describes attitudes toward and opportunities
   related to competency-based education in graduation education in
   colleges and schools of pharmacy, identifies types of tools schools
   could use to enhance training towards the competency framework developed
   by the 2016-2017 RGAC, particularly with regards to the so-called power
   skills, and outlines a role for AACP in facilitating this training. This
   report also considers a number of barriers, both perceived and real,
   that potential students encounter when considering graduate training and
   suggests strategies to understand the impact of and mitigate these
   barriers. To strengthen competency-based graduate education, the RGAC
   puts forth two recommendations that AACP develop a toolkit supporting
   the training of power skills and that AACP should develop or curate
   programs or tools to support the use of individual development plans
   (IDPs). The RGAC also puts forth a suggestion to schools that IDPs be
   implemented for all students. In considering the barriers to pursuing
   graduate education, the Committee proposes one policy statement that
   AACP supports the training and development of an increasingly diverse
   population of researchers at pharmacy schools through active efforts to
   promote M.S. and Ph.D. education along with Pharm.D. education.
   Additionally, the Committee provides recommendations that AACP should
   expand its efforts in career tracking of graduate students to include
   collection and/or analysis of data that could inform the Academy's
   understanding of barriers to pursuing graduate education in pharmacy
   schools, the AACP Office of Institutional Research and Effectiveness
   should expand upon graduate program data described in the annual Profile
   of Pharmacy Students report, and finally that AACP should include
   graduate programs in efforts to increase diversity of students at
   pharmacy schools.},

Title = {Optimal Allocation Model for EV Charging Stations Coordinating Investor
   and User Benefits},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {36039-36049},
Abstract = {Deploying charging stations (CSs) catering to the demand from electric
   vehicles plays an important role in modernizing energy infrastructures.
   In this paper, a bi-level optimal allocation model for allocating fast
   CSs is proposed aiming to maximize the CS investor benefit (upper layer
   sub-problem) by optimally allocating CSs with the coordinated
   determination of the expected efficiency of charging service supply
   (lower layer sub-problem). The efficiency is formulated as a charging
   performance index in terms of user satisfaction degree, which
   mathematically couples the upper level and lower level subproblems. The
   proposed nonlinear bi-level model is reduced to a single-layer
   optimization model under the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions.
   An improved dynamic differential evolution algorithm with an adaptive
   update strategy is proposed to solve this single-layer optimization
   model. The proposed method is validated using a realistic case. The test
   results show that the proposed methodology is able to co-ordinate both
   objectives of interest, i.e., allocating CSs network with the maximized
   benefits and optimizing the fast charging service efficiency at the same
   time.},

Title = {Intrinsic roles in the crosshair - strategic analysis of multi-site role
   implementation with an adapted matrix map approach},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {JUN 27},
Abstract = {BackgroundThe implementation of competency-based intrinsic roles in
   undergraduate medical education remains a challenge. Faculties in
   transition need to be provided with generalizable curricular data in
   order to facilitate orientation on curricular roles' representation and
   to decide on steps of curriculum development. Explicit and implicit
   representation of objectives and multi-site agreement can be viewed as
   status indicators for the adoption of roles. Our aim was to develop a
   pragmatic cross-locational approach to capture roles' developmental
   status in an overview and prioritize strategic
   recommendations.MethodsBased on the mapping data from six German medical
   faculties, the relationship between explicit and implicit curricular
   representation of role' objectives (weighting) and extent of programs'
   consent (agreement) was calculated. Data was visualized in a
   role-specific Matrix Map to analyse roles' implicit-explicit relation
   and risk-value potential. The matrix was combined with Roger's stages of
   innovation diffusion for differentiated interpretation of the
   developmental role status.ResultsEntangling multi-site agreement and
   curricular weighting, the 4-Field-Matrix allows to assess objectives
   based on their current localization in a quadrant: Disregard (lower
   left) and Progress quadrant (upper left) reveal the diffusion period;
   Potential (lower right) and Emphasis quadrant (upper right) indicate the
   adoption period. The role patterns differ in curricular representation,
   progression and clarity: (1) Scholar: explicit/implicit - scattered
   across the matrix; most explicit objectives in Progress. (2) Health
   Advocate: explicit - primarily in Emphasis; only role in which the
   explicit representation significantly exceeds the implicit. (3)
   Collaborator: explicit - mainly Potential; implicit - Progress or
   Emphasis. (4) Professional: explicit - primarily Potential but also
   Emphasis; implicit - Progress and Emphasis; appears better adopted but
   scattered in weighting; high hidden curricula. (5) Manager: explicit and
   implicit - exclusively in Potential, without signs of development. Role
   patterns correspond to evidences from literature. Exemplified with
   roles, quadrant-specific strategies and measures are suggested.
   Framework reviewers may gain information for discussion of critical
   content.ConclusionThe Matrix Map enables to catch intuitively the status
   of intrinsic roles' profiles regarding role pattern, implicit-explicit
   relation and programs agreement. Thus, interpretation and informed
   discussions are fostered. Further target-oriented analyses and strategic
   developments can be conducted to enhance transparency and
   resource-efficiency.},

Abstract = {Searching content in mobile opportunistic networks is a difficult
   problem due to the dynamically changing topology and intermittent
   connections. Moreover, due to the lack of global view of the network, it
   is arduous to determine whether the best response is discovered or
   search should be spread to other nodes. A node that has received a
   search query has to take two decisions: (i) whether to continue the
   search further or stop it at the current node (current search depth)
   and, independently of that, (ii) whether to send a response back or not.
   As each transmission and extra hop costs in terms of energy, bandwidth
   and time, a balance between the expected value of the response and the
   costs incurred must be sought. In order to better understand this
   inherent trade-off, we consider a model where both the query and
   response follow the same or similar path. We formulate the problem of
   optimal search for two cases: a node holds (i) exactly matching content
   with some probability, and (ii) some content partially matching the
   query. We design static search in which the search depth is set at query
   initiation, dynamic search in which search depth is determined locally
   during query forwarding, and learning dynamic search which leverages the
   observations to estimate suitability of content for the query.
   Additionally, we show how unreliable response paths affect the optimal
   search depth and the corresponding search performance. Moreover, we
   study different methods to a priori learn the availability of the
   content in the network based on passive observations (e.g., using
   regression and maximum-likelihood based estimates). Such information is
   highly valuable when defining the optimal search parameters. Finally, we
   investigate the principal factors affecting the optimal search strategy.

Abstract = {The time-shifting elements and high between individual changeability
   make early forecast of a seizure express a difficult errand. Numerous
   examinations have demonstrated that EEG signals do have profitable data
   that if effectively broke down, could help in the expectation of
   seizures in epileptic patients before their event. A few numerical
   changes have been broke down for its connection with seizure beginning
   forecast and a progression of analyses were done to ensure their
   qualities. New calculations are exhibited to help elucidate, screen, and
   cross-approve the order of EEG signs to foresee the ictal (for example
   seizure) states, explicitly the preictal, interictal, and postictal
   states in the mind. These new strategies show promising outcomes in
   distinguishing the nearness of a preictal stage before the ictal state.
   Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are playing major role in
   Diagnosis and Predicting the diseases, EEG signal were recorded with 16
   channel system from brain scalp and stored in system. From recorded
   database seizure levels were analyzed from each channel by articrafting
   with ICA and PCA algorithms and processed through Band pass filter to
   identify the Delta, Theta, Alpha and Beta levels. After collecting the
   brain signals from each channel they were bided with FFT to get the data
   in time domain series. A machine learning model is developed using
   python programming by sampling on obtained EEG data, sampled data is
   trained on to the system. Machine Learning algorithms were applied to
   the data to accuracy and predict the accuracy on developed model neural
   network is applied to identify the True-False values. The analyzed data
   is integrated with IOT framework to Diagnosis the Cerebral Palsy patient
   remotely. Remote monitoring system for the persons with Intellectual
   disabilities and update the health status to care takers time to time
   while they are at work. It's also reduces the patient work load by
   checking his details staying at home rather going to a hospital. If
   system identifies any changes in patient heart rate, brain signals, body
   temperature, the system alerts the doctor and respective relatives about
   patient's status over IOT and also stores the patient details in the
   cloud.},

Abstract = {Surgical resident autonomy is an essential element of the transition
   from supervised training to independent practice. However, in an age of
   duty hour restrictions, legislative constraints, increased litigation,
   and heightened societal expectations, training an autonomous resident
   proves increasingly difficult. To tackle these barriers to training
   successful surgeons, the American College of Surgeons Committee on
   Resident Education initiated the Resident Mentored Autonomy Project. As
   a subdivision of this project, the Empowered Learner research team here
   presents a framework for training the self-directed and empowered
   surgical resident learner. There are many strategies by which surgical
   faculty, program directors and chairs, and residents themselves may
   engage to improve resident operative autonomy. (c) 2022 Association of

Title = {Rules discovery in fuzzy classifier systems with PSO for scheduling in

Abstract = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a bio-inspired optimization
   strategy founded on the movement of particles within swarms. PSO can be
   encoded in a few lines in most programming languages, it uses only
   elementary mathematical operations, and it is not costly as regards
   memory demand and running time. This paper discusses the application of
   PSO to rules discovery in fuzzy classifier systems (FCSs) instead of the
   classical genetic approach and it proposes a new strategy, Knowledge
   Acquisition with Rules as Particles (KARP). In KARP approach every rule
   is encoded as a particle that moves in the space in order to cooperate
   in obtaining high quality rule bases and in this way, improving the
   knowledge and performance of the FCS. The proposed swarm-based strategy
   is evaluated in a well-known problem of practical importance nowadays
   where the integration of fuzzy systems is increasingly emerging due to
   the inherent uncertainty and dynamism of the environment: scheduling in
   grid distributed computational infrastructures. Simulation results are
   compared to those of classical genetic learning for fuzzy classifier
   systems and the greater accuracy and convergence speed of classifier
   discovery systems using KARP is shown. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Video coaching has been found to be an effective teaching
   method because it incorporates many of the established principles of
   successful adult learning. The goal of our study was to assess the
   feasibility and effectiveness of using a point-of-view video camera
   (Google Glass) to improve the surgical skills education of orthopaedic
   surgery residents.
   METHODS: Forty-two residents from 4 institutions participated in a
   partially blinded randomized control trial performing an intra-articular
   distal tibial fracture reduction task while wearing Google Glass to
   record the performance. Participants underwent a structured coaching
   session with 20 participants (intervention group) using the recorded
   video to augment this session, and 22 participants (control group)
   receiving verbal coaching alone. The task was repeated again immediately
   after the coaching session. Performance was scored using an Objective
   Structured Assessment of Technical Skills checklist, Global Rating
   Scale, fluoroscopic usage, and reduction quality. A semistructured
   interview was then performed to assess experience of participants.
   RESULTS: There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) seen in score
   improvement in the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills
   checklist, Global Rating Scale, fluoroscopic usage, or reduction quality
   between the control and intervention groups. Thematic analysis of
   interview showed majority of participants found video coaching increased
   effectiveness in understanding of goals, developing techniques and
   strategies, and process of self-reflection. Their involvement was seen
   overall as a positive experience, with participants wanting to see more
   inclusion of video coaching within surgical education.
   CONCLUSIONS: No difference in performance improvement between the 2
   groups was seen, but majority of participants found the video coaching
   sessions valuable and could have potential beneficial role in education.

Abstract = {Study abroad experiences, relatively rare in chemistry programs and
   encouraged by the American Chemical Society, are a way to advance the
   cultural competence of students. We describe a study abroad experience
   that includes an upper level chemistry course on fermentation. Many
   articles have described the integration of fermentation into lecture and
   lab classes, providing instructors with resources for course
   development. The described course demonstrates several novel features: a
   model for the development of a study abroad experience, a strategy for
   increasing student enrollment, and a mechanism to ensure student
   engagement with the fermentation content before and during the study

Title = {Graduate entry and undergraduate medical students' study approaches,
   stress levels and ways of coping: a five year longitudinal study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Background: Incorporating graduate students into undergraduate medical
   degree programs is a commonly accepted practice. However, it has only
   recently been recognized that these two types of students cope with
   their studies in various ways. The aim was to compare the learning
   approaches, stress levels and ways of coping of undergraduate (UG) and
   graduate entry medical students (GEMP) throughout their medical course.
   Methods: From 2007-2011 each of the five year cohorts of undergraduate
   and GEMP students completed four components of the study. The components
   included demographics, The Biggs' R-SPQ-2 F questionnaire which
   determines students' approaches to learning, the Perceived Stress Scale
   (PSS) used to rate students perceived stress during the past four weeks,
   and the Ways of Coping (WOC) questionnaire used to assess students'
   methods of coping with everyday problems.
   Results: There was a consistent difference between UG and GEMP students
   approaches to learning over the five years. GEMP students preferred a
   deep approach while the UG students preferred a superficial approach to
   learning. This difference became more obvious in the clinical years.
   There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in
   stress levels. There were consistent differences in the ways the two
   groups coped with stress.
   Conclusions: There were significant differences in approaches to
   learning and ways of coping with stress between the UG and the GEMP
   students. These need to be considered when introducing curriculum
   change, in particular, redesigning an UG program for post graduate
   delivery.},

Title = {Towards Posture and Gait Evaluation through Wearable-Based Biofeedback
   Technologies},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In medicine and sport science, postural evaluation is an essential part
   of gait and posture correction. There are various instruments for
   quantifying the postural system's efficiency and determining postural
   stability which are considered state-of-the-art. However, such systems
   present many limitations related to accessibility, economic cost, size,
   intrusiveness, usability, and time-consuming set-up. To mitigate these
   limitations, this project aims to verify how wearable devices can be
   assembled and employed to provide feedback to human subjects for gait
   and posture improvement, which could be applied for sports performance
   or motor impairment rehabilitation (from neurodegenerative diseases,
   aging, or injuries). The project is divided into three parts: the first
   part provides experimental protocols for studying action anticipation
   and related processes involved in controlling posture and gait based on
   state-of-the-art instrumentation. The second part provides a biofeedback
   strategy for these measures concerning the design of a low-cost wearable
   system. Finally, the third provides algorithmic processing of the
   biofeedback to customize the feedback based on performance conditions,
   including individual variability. Here, we provide a detailed
   experimental design that distinguishes significant postural indicators
   through a conjunct architecture that integrates state-of-the-art
   postural and gait control instrumentation and a data collection and
   analysis framework based on low-cost devices and freely accessible
   machine learning techniques. Preliminary results on 12 subjects showed
   that the proposed methodology accurately recognized the phases of the
   defined motor tasks (i.e., rotate, in position, APAs, drop, and recover)
   with overall F1-scores of 89.6\% and 92.4\%, respectively, concerning
   subject-independent and subject-dependent testing setups.},

Abstract = {Sector duration optimization (SDO) is a problem arising in treatment
   planning for stereotactic radiosurgery on Gamma Knife. Given a set of
   isocenter locations, SDO aims to select collimator size configurations
   and irradiation times thereof such that target tissues receive
   prescribed doses in a reasonable amount of treatment time and healthy
   tissues nearby are spared. We present a multiobjective linear
   programming model for SDO to gener-ate a diverse collection of solutions
   so that clinicians can select the most appropriate treat-ment. We
   develop a generic two-phase solution strategy based on the
   epsilon-constraint method for solving multiobjective optimization
   models, 2PHAS epsilon, which aims to systematically increase the number
   of high-quality solutions obtained, instead of conducting a traditional
   uniform search. To improve solution quality further and to accelerate
   the procedure, we incorporate some general and problem-specific
   enhancements. Moreover, we propose an alternative version of 2PHAS
   epsilon, which makes use of machine learning tools to reduce the
   com-putational effort. In our computational study on eight previously
   treated real test cases, a significant portion of 2PHAS epsilon
   solutions outperformed clinical results and those from a single
   -objective model from the literature. In addition to significant
   benefits of the algorithmic enhancements, our experiments illustrate the
   usefulness of machine learning strategies to reduce the overall run
   times nearly by half while maintaining or besting the clinical practice.},

Title = {A Feasible Fall Evaluation System via Artificial Intelligence Gesture
   Detection of Gait and Balance for Sub-Healthy Community- Dwelling Older
   Adults in Taiwan},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Abstract = {In Taiwan, falls are one of the major causes of permanent disability and
   seeking medical care in older adults. One in seven people in the
   Taiwanese population exceeds the age of 65 years, and there are roughly
   4 million community-dwelling older adults. One in six older adults have
   fallen or been diagnosed with Sarcopenia, which can lead to a loss of
   mobility. The major identified risk factors are impaired balance and
   gait. Implementing an early-stage prevention system is already an urgent
   requirement. The primary objective of this study is to propose an
   artificial intelligence (AI) Internet of Things (IoT) program and to
   develop an easy-access fall prevention system. This study took the
   criteria of the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) and
   implemented it in field practice. Field experts reviewed data from the
   combination of gait parameters and gesture parameters and adaptively
   modified the training course bi-weekly. With 3 months of field practice
   and intervention, sub-healthy older adults' average increase in gait
   speed was 29.83\% for male participants and 34.06\% for female
   participants. The results of this study demonstrate that rehabilitation
   of older adults can significantly improve mobility. This helps to
   understand the relationship of gait and gesture patterns to walking
   stability and strategies and adaptive interventions that could be taught
   in expertise programs to minimize the risk of fall.},

Abstract = {Current models of quality improvement and patient safety (QIPS)
   education are not fully integrated with clinical care delivery,
   representing a major impediment toward achieving widespread QIPS
   competency among health professions learners and practitioners. The
   Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada organized a 2-day
   consensus conference in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, called Building
   the Bridge to Quality, in September 2016. Its goal was to convene an
   international group of educational and health system leaders, educators,
   frontline clinicians, learners, and patients to engage in a
   consensus-building process and generate a list of actionable strategies
   that individuals and organizations can use to better integrate QIPS
   education with clinical care. Four strategic directions emerged:
   prioritize the integration of QIPS education and clinical care, build
   structures and implement processes to integrate QIPS education and
   clinical care, build capacity for QIPS education at multiple levels, and
   align educational and patient outcomes to improve quality and patient
   safety. Individuals and organizations can refer to the specific tactics
   associated with the 4 strategic directions to create a road map of
   targeted actions most relevant to their organizational starting point.
   To achieve widespread change, collaborative efforts and alignment of
   intrinsic and extrinsic motivators are needed on an international scale
   to shift the culture of educational and clinical environments and build
   bridges that connect training programs and clinical environments, align
   educational and health system priorities, and improve both learning and
   care, with the ultimate goal of achieving improved outcomes and
   experiences for patients, their families, and communities.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To investigate youth basketball coaches' perceptions and
   implementation of fundamental movement skills training. Method: Snowball
   and criterion-based sampling approaches were used to survey youth
   basketball coaches (n=79) beliefs and experiences relating to their
   perceptions and implementation of nonbasketball-specific skills and
   fundamental movement skills into practice. Realist evaluation inspired
   the analysis of descriptive statistics (means and frequencies) and
   reflexive qualitative thematic analysis to inform the results. Results:
   It was found that the participants had a comprehension of fundamental
   movement skills and acknowledge their value in the long-term development
   of youth players. However, there appeared to be varying levels of uptake
   among the surveyed coaches. Discussion: Based on these findings, coaches
   appear to hold sports specialization in a higher regard than the broader
   aspects of player development, illustrating a dichotomized perspective
   of fundamental movement skills and basketball. Conclusion: The findings
   suggest there is a need for governing bodies to develop innovative
   strategies to persuade youth basketball coaches to adopt
   nonsports-specific movement skills to improve their practice.},

Title = {The CARE platform for the analysis of behavior model inference
   techniques},

Abstract = {Context: Finite State Machine (FSM) inference from execution traces has
   received a lot of attention over the past few years. Various approaches
   have been explored, each holding different properties for the resulting
   models, but the lack of standard benchmarks limits the ability of
   comparing the proposed techniques. Evaluation is usually performed on a
   few case studies, which is useful for assessing the feasibility of the
   algorithm on particular cases, but fails to demonstrate effectiveness in
   a broad context. Consequently, understanding the strengths and
   weaknesses of inference techniques remains a challenging task.
   Objective: This paper proposes CARE, a general, approach-independent,
   platform for the intensive evaluation of FSM inference techniques.
   Method: Grounded in a program specification scheme that provides a good
   control on the expected program structures, it allows the production of
   large benchmarks with well identified properties.
   Results: The CARE platform demonstrates the following features: (1)
   providing a benchmarking mechanism for FSM inference techniques, (2)
   allowing analysis of existing techniques w.r.t. a class of programs
   and/or behaviors, and (3) helping users in choosing the best suited
   approach for their objective. Moreover, our extensive experiments on
   different FSM inference techniques highlight that they do not behave in
   the same manner on every class of program. Characterizing different
   classes of programs thus helps understanding the strengths and
   weaknesses of the studied techniques.
   Conclusion: Experiments reported in this paper show examples of use
   cases that demonstrate the ability of the platform to generate large and
   diverse sets of programs, which allows to carry out meaningful inference
   techniques analysis. The analysis strategies the CARE platform offers
   open new opportunities for program behavior learning, particularly in
   conjunction with model checking techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Undergraduate STEM Instructors' Teacher Identities and Discourses on
   Student Gender Expression and Equity},

Abstract = {Background Despite long-standing initiatives to improve gender equity
   across STEM fields, women's representation in undergraduate engineering
   programs remains low. STEM faculty, as influential gatekeepers, can
   promote gender inclusivity in these fields. Yet, little is known about
   how faculty construct their responsibilities to advance gender equity.
   Purpose/Hypothesis We investigated how STEM faculty teaching first-year
   engineering courses constructed teacher identities and responsibilities.
   Our research questions included: What discourses do faculty use to
   construct the meaning of student gender expression in their classroom?
   How do faculty discursively position themselves in relation to gender
   equity? What teacher identities and responsibilities do they construct
   through these discourses?
   Design/Method Utilizing a feminist, poststructural epistemology and
   discursive methodology, we analyzed 18 interviews with instructors in
   three undergraduate engineering programs. After coding data for ways
   instructors talked about gender in their work with students, we analyzed
   how faculty constructed their teacher identities in relation to each
   discourse and how these positions affected their promotion of gender
   equity.
   Results Faculty used three dominant discourses to construct student
   gender expression and teacher identities: gender blindness, gender
   acknowledgment, and gender intervention. Faculty most frequently
   utilized discourses acknowledging gender inequity, which often limited
   their responsibilities to promote equity and highlights the pernicious
   nature of systemic gender bias.
   Conclusions Findings suggest that institutions could expand discourse
   and better align faculty awareness of gender inequity with meaningful,
   pedagogical change strategies.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Continuing professional development activities should be
   designed to meet the identified personal goals of the learner. This
   article aims to explore the self-perceived competency levels and the
   professional educational needs of pharmacists in Qatar and to compare
   these with observations of pharmacy students undergoing experiential
   training in pharmacies (students) and pharmacy academics, directors, and
   managers (managers).
   Methods: Three questionnaires were developed and administered to
   practicing pharmacists, undergraduate pharmacy students who have
   performed structured experiential training rotations in multiple
   pharmacy outlets in Qatar and pharmacy managers. The questionnaires used
   items extracted from the National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory
   Authorities (NAPRA) Professional competencies for Canadian pharmacists
   at entry to practice and measured self- and observed pharmacists'
   competency and satisfaction with competency level.
   Results: Training and educational needs were similar between the
   pharmacists and observers, although there was trend for pharmacists to
   choose more fact-intensive topics compared with observers whose
   preferences were toward practice areas. There was no association between
   the competency level of pharmacists as perceived by observers and as
   self-assessed by pharmacists (P <= .05). Pharmacists' self-assessed
   competency level was consistently higher than that reported by students
   (P <= .05).
   Discussion: The results suggest that the use of traditional
   triangulation might not be sufficient to articulate the professional
   needs and competencies of practicing pharmacists as part of a strategy
   to build continuing professional development programs. Pharmacists might
   have a limited ability to accurately self-assess, and observer
   assessments might be significantly different from self-assessments which
   present a dilemma on which assessment to consider closer to reality. The
   processes currently used to evaluate competence may need to be enhanced
   through the use of well-designed rubrics or other strategies to empower
   and to better inform respondents and subsequently improve their ability
   to self-assess their competencies.},

Abstract = {Emotions are foundational to teaching and teacher education practice.
   They can influence all aspects of the change process, including
   considerations of relationships, pedagogical and curricular decisions,
   and organizational structures. While the study of emotions in teaching
   has increased since the 1990s, less explicit attention has been paid to
   the role of emotions in teacher education practice. Using a
   sociocultural perspective on emotion, the purpose of this research was
   to consider the emotional aspects of pedagogical change experienced by
   teacher educators. The context in which change occurred was the
   development and enactment of a blended course (i.e. using face-to-face
   and online formats) in one physical education teacher education program.
   Collaborative self-study of teacher education practice methodology
   guided the research design, including the processes of critical
   friendship, and data collection and analysis strategies. Emotions were
   omnipresent throughout the pedagogical change process and were expressed
   by both the teacher educator whose practice was being examined and the
   critical friend. Emotions were often experienced in contrasting ways and
   in tension to each other; for example, trust-distrust, and
   uncertainty-confidence. The explicit focus on the emotional dimension
   brought to life the teacher educators' experiences, taking the analysis
   beyond the technical and rational implementation of decisions and
   offering a humanistic perspective on the pedagogical change process. The
   focus on emotion carries implications for policies and practices related
   to the ongoing professional development of teacher educators.},

Title = {A Systematic Interdisciplinary Engineering and Technology Model Using
   Cutting-Edge Technologies for STEM Education},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {64},
Number = {4},
Pages = {390-397},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Contribution: A systematic interdisciplinary engineering and technology
   instructional model using cutting-edge technologies is proposed in this
   research. This model consists of four key components: 1)
   interdisciplinary collaboration; 2) hands-on projects; 3) real-world
   simulations; and 4) cutting-edge technologies. The model was designed to
   engage students in the real-world engineering projects and experience
   through the following activities: 1) performing the design, fabrication,
   and lab testing; 2) modeling and analyzing testing samples; 3)
   conducting on-site experiments; and 4) performing data processing and
   analysis. Background: Engineering programs are challenged by the rapid
   development of innovative technologies. To address this challenge, it is
   required to provide engineering graduates with ``soft skills{''} for the
   capability of project management, especially the communication and
   collaboration among disciplines through university education. Therefore,
   it is desired to develop a systematic interdisciplinary engineering and
   technology educational strategy. Research questions: 1) is the proposed
   systematic interdisciplinary instructional model appropriate and
   feasible to be integrated into the engineering curriculum? 2) what were
   the students' perceptions and experiences about the interdisciplinary
   model? 3) does the interdisciplinary model facilitate engineering
   students' soft skills, such as interdisciplinary communication and
   collaboration? and 4) does the interdisciplinary model help to enhance
   engineering students' real-world professional experience, develop design
   thinking and problem-solving skills, which will help them to transfer
   their learning experience from the classroom setting to the real-world
   setting? Methodology: A systematic interdisciplinary engineering and
   technology model was developed, implemented, and evaluated. Findings:
   The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed systematic
   instructional model were validated by various data sources. The tested
   model is recommended for broader adaptation in various STEM disciplines.},

Abstract = {As society and technology change the way public transit systems are
   perceived, contemporary professionals need to be equipped with the
   skills to manage transportation systems to keep up with modern demands
   and challenges. Information Communication Technologies and data ubiquity
   represent great potential advances in transport systems; however, the
   challenge of transferring the knowledge from research and academia
   remains a significant barrier. This paper contributes to the literature
   in two ways: it serves as a benchmark for the challenges in transit
   systems planning education today, and it is a reference guide for future
   educators to find resources to create and refine effective educational
   programs in this area. A case study of a sample teaching module for
   transit systems planning in the Greater Toronto Area is presented with
   guidelines to teach (1) models of data-driven flexible transit services;
   (2) technologies to integrate and visualize user and systems data; and
   (3) methodologies to evaluate demand for such services at a societal
   level. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Abstract = {Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) integrate
   authentic research into undergraduate chemistry laboratories,
   introducing students to research while simultaneously reinforcing
   fundamental concepts. Despite their ubiquitous nature in bioanalytical
   research, few CUREs have been published applying the fundamental
   techniques of separations, spectroscopy, quantification, and mass
   spectrometry. To engage students in learning these increasingly
   essential bioanalytical techniques, we designed and implemented a
   semester-long project-based course centered around the purification,
   quantification, and identification of heterologously expressed proteins
   in five succinct and adaptable modules. Instructors can use these
   modules to form the foundation of a CURE specific to their research
   interests. The extensive commercial availability of plasmids for
   transformation combined with the modular approach to laboratory
   experiments enables convenient customization to accommodate diverse
   research goals. Instructors can tailor the modules to meet the
   curricular requirements and instrumentation capabilities of their
   institutions and can easily extend the research goals to incorporate
   more specialized analytical techniques, as needed. Through the
   implementation of the five modules, students apply the fundaments of
   acid-base chemistry, statistics, quantification strategies,
   spectrophotometry, separations, and mass spectrometry, thus covering the
   material required in most undergraduate introductory analytical courses.
   Instructors can then use these modules as a backbone to support
   student-led discovery-based investigations for the remainder of the
   course. Students demonstrate their understanding through the completion
   of a comprehensive, publication-style laboratory report as well as a
   poster presentation at a university-wide undergraduate research
   symposium. Since first offering this course in 2016, student evaluations
   have been exceedingly positive, with over 75\% of students indicating
   that the course both increased their scientific skills as well as their
   confidence in their ability to succeed in further science courses.
   Furthermore, 22\% of students reported they were ``much more{''} or
   ``extremely more{''} likely to enroll in a Ph.D. program in science,
   math, or engineering following the courses, emphasizing the impact that
   project-based laboratories can have on undergraduate chemists' career
   trajectories.},

Abstract = {Developing algorithms that discover all frequently occurring subgraphs
   in a large graph database is computationally extensive, as graph and
   subgraph isomorphisms play a key role throughout the computations. Since
   subgraph isomorphism testing is a hard problem, fragment miners are
   exponential in runtime. To alleviate the complexity issue, we propose to
   introduce a bias in the projection operator and instead of using the
   costly subgraph isomorphism projection, one can use a polynomial
   projection having a semantically valid structural interpretation. In
   this paper, our purpose is to present LC-mine, a generic and efficient
   framework to mine frequent subgraphs by the means of local consistency
   techniques used in the constraint programming field. Two instances of
   the framework based on the arc consistency technique are developed and
   presented in this paper. The first instance follows a breadth-first
   order, while the second is a pattern-growth approach that follows a
   depth-first search space exploration strategy. Then, we prove
   experimentally that we can achieve an important performance gain without
   or with nonsignificant loss of discovered patterns in terms of quality.},

Abstract = {Wireless-powered mobile-edge computing (MEC) emerges as a crucial
   component in the Internet of Things (IoTs). It can cope with the
   fundamental performance limitations of low-power networks, such as
   wireless sensor networks or mobile networks. Although computation
   offloading and resource allocation in MEC have been studied with
   different optimization objectives, performance optimization in
   larger-scale systems still needs to be further improved. More
   importantly, energy efficiency is also a key issue as well as
   computation offloading and resource allocation for wireless-powered MEC.
   In this article, we investigate the joint optimization of computation
   rate and energy consumption under limited resources, and propose an
   online offloading model to search for the asymptotically optimal
   offloading and resource allocation strategy. First, the joint
   optimization problem is modeled as a mixed integer programming (MIP)
   problem. Second, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method,
   energy efficiency computation offloading using probabilistic action
   generating (ECOPG), is designed to generate the joint optimization
   policy for computation offloading and resource allocation. Finally, to
   avoid the curse of dimensionality in large network scales, an action
   exploration mechanism based on probability is introduced to accelerate
   the convergence rate by targeted sampling and dynamic experience replay.
   The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods
   significantly outperform other DRL-based methods in energy consumption,
   and gain better computation rate and execution efficiency at the same
   time. With the expansion of the network scale, the improvements become
   more apparent.},

Title = {How is Students' Understanding of Nature of Science Related with Their
   Metacognitive Awareness?},
Journal = {SCIENCE \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 SEP 23},
Abstract = {The paper reports an empirical study on the relationship between middle
   school students' understanding of nature of science (NOS) and their
   metacognitive awareness. The reconceptualised family resemblance
   approach to the nature of science (RFN) (Erduran \& Dagher, 2014; Kaya
   \& Erduran, 2016) as a holistic framework that covers science as
   epistemic-cognitive and social system guided the study. A total of 701
   students (180 5th, 167 6th, 170 7th, and 184 8th grade) and 3 students
   from each grade level (in total 12 students) who have low, moderate,
   high-RFN understanding, and metacognitive awareness levels were
   interviewed. The data sources are the ``RFN Student Questionnaire,{''}
   ``Meta-cognitive Awareness Inventory for Children,{''} and interviews.
   The data was analyzed with Pearson product-moment and thematic analysis.
   The results indicated that there is a statistically positive
   relationship between middle school students' RFN understanding and their
   metacognitive awareness. Furthermore, the results of the interviews
   showed that students' responses to RFN and metacognitive awareness
   questions were aligned and compatible. The students with high
   metacognitive awareness had higher RFN understanding and those with
   lower metacognitive awareness had lower RFN understanding. This
   relationship was evident for each grade level student separately as
   well. The study opens a new study area in terms of the use of
   metacognitive strategies in RFN-enriched lessons for experimental and
   causal-comparative designs. The teacher education programs or curriculum
   studies can consider utilization of metacognitive prompts in NOS
   teaching.},

Title = {DRL-Based Edge Computing Model to Offload the FIFA World Cup Traffic},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {NOV 19},
Abstract = {In recent years, the volume of global video traffic has been increasing
   rapidly and it is considerably significant to offload the traffic during
   the process of video transmission and improve the experience of users.
   In this paper, we propose a novel traffic offloading strategy to provide
   a feasible and efficient reference for the following 2022 FIFA World Cup
   held in Qatar. At first, we present the system framework based on the
   Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm, which supports transferring the
   FIFA World Cup traffic to the mobile edge servers. Then, the Deep
   Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is used to provide the traffic scheduling
   method and minimize the scheduling time of application programs.
   Meanwhile, the task scheduling operation is regarded as the process of
   Markov decision, and the proximal policy optimization method is used to
   train the Deep Neural Network in the DRL. For the proposed traffic
   offloading strategy, we do the simulation based on two real datasets,
   and the experimental results show that it has smaller scheduling time,
   higher bandwidth utilization, and better experience of user than two
   baselines.},

Title = {Improving Surgical Safety and Nontechnical Skills in Variable-Resource
   Contexts: A Novel Educational Curriculum},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A substantial proportion of adverse intra-operative events
   are attributed to failures in nontechnical skills. To strengthen these
   skills and improve surgical safety, the Non-Technical Skills for
   Surgeons (NOTSS) taxonomy was developed as a common framework. The NOTSS
   taxonomy was adapted for low- and middle-income countries, where
   variable resources pose a significant challenge to safe surgery. The
   NOTSS for variable-resource contexts (VRC) curriculum was developed and
   implemented in Rwanda, with the aim of enhancing knowledge and attitudes
   about nontechnical skills and promoting surgical safety.
   DESIGN: The NOTSS-VRC curriculum was developed through a rigorous
   process of integrating contextually appropriate values. It was
   implemented as a 1-day training course for surgical and anesthesia
   postgraduate trainees. The curriculum comprises lectures, videos, and
   group discussions. A pretraining and posttraining questionnaire was
   administered to compare knowledge and attitudes regarding nontechnical
   skills, and their potential to improve surgical safety.
   SETTING: The setting of this study was in the tertiary teaching hospital
   of Kigali, Rwanda.
   PARTICIPANTS: Participants were residents of the University of Kigali. A
   total of 55 residents participated from general surgery (31.4\%),
   obstetrics (25.5\%), anesthesia (17.6\%), and other surgical specialties
   (25.5\%).
   RESULTS: In a paired analysis, understanding of NOTSS improved
   significantly (55.6\% precourse, 80.9\% post course, p<0.01). All
   residents reported that the course would improve their ability to
   provide safer patient care, and 97.4\% believed developing nontechnical
   skills would improve patient outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Nontechnical skills must be highlighted in surgical
   training in low- and middle-income countries. The NOTSS-VRC curriculum
   can be implemented without additional technology or significant
   financial cost. Its deliberate design for resource-constrained settings
   allows it to be used both as an educational course and a quality
   improvement strategy. Our research demonstrates it is feasible to
   improve knowledge and attitudes about NOTSS through a 1-day course, and
   represents a novel approach to improving global surgical safety. (C)

Abstract = {Background: Nursing students often perform poorly on numeracy tests.
   Whilst one-off interventions have been trialled with limited success, a
   whole-of-curriculum approach may provide a better means of improving
   applied numeracy skills.
   Objective: The objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of a
   whole-of-curriculum approach in improving nursing students' applied
   numeracy skills.
   Design: Two cycles of assessment, implementation and evaluation of
   strategies were conducted following a high fail rate in the final
   applied numeracy examination in a Bachelor of Nursing (BN) programme.
   Strategies included an early diagnostic assessment followed by referral
   to remediation, setting the pass mark at 100\% for each of six applied
   numeracy examinations across the programme, and employing a specialist
   mathematics teacher to provide consistent numeracy teaching.
   Setting: The setting of the study is one Australian university.
   Participants: 1035 second and third year nursing students enrolled in
   four clinical nursing courses (CNC III, CNC IV, CNC V and CNC VI) were
   included.
   Methods: Data on the percentage of students who obtained 100\% in their
   applied numeracy examination in up to two attempts were collected from
   CNCs III, IV, V and VI between 2008 and 2011. A four by two chi(2)
   contingency table was used to determine if the differences in the
   proportion of students achieving 100\% across two examination attempts
   in each CNC were significantly different between 2008 and 2011.
   Results: The percentage of students who obtained 100\% correct answers
   on the applied numeracy examinations was significantly higher in 2011
   than in 2008 in CNC III (chi(2) = 272, 3; p < 0.001), IV (chi(2) = 94.7,
   3; p < 0.001) and VI (chi(2) = 76.3,3; p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: A whole-of-curriculum approach to developing applied
   numeracy skills in RN students resulted in a substantial improvement in
   these skills over four years. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Network Function Parallelization for High Reliability and Low Latency
   Services},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {75894-75905},
Abstract = {In 5G-and-beyond wireless communication systems, Network Function
   Virtualization (NFV) has been widely acknowledged as an important
   network architecture solution to meet diverse service requirements in
   various scenarios. However, with the increase of network functions, the
   introduction of NFV may significantly increase the delay of traffic
   flows, which is much undesired, especially for Ultra Reliable and Low
   Latency Communication (URLLC) service. Network Function Parallelism
   (NFP) architecture has been recently proposed as an effective technique
   to address the bottleneck of NFV technology. NFP can potentially improve
   the reliability and reduce the delay of service function chains (SFCs).
   In this paper, we propose a learning based SFC deployment strategy under
   NFP architecture with aim to improve the service reliability while
   reducing the end-to-end service delay. Specifically, service reliability
   is improved by deploying back-up virtual network function (VNF) nodes,
   while the flow delay is reduced via parallel network function
   processing. We formulate the VNF deployment as an integer-programming
   problem with objective of minimizing the reserved computing and
   bandwidth resources, while guaranteeing the service reliability and
   end-to-end delay. Considering the hardness and properties of the
   problem, we transform it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and employ
   a reinforcement-learning algorithm to solve it. We conduct simulations
   and the numerical results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can
   significantly improve the service reliability and delay performance,
   which are crucial for URLLC service.},

Title = {Faculty Perceptions: A Qualitative Study of the Perceived Need,
   Opportunities, and Challenges of Developing ``One Health-One
   Medicine{''} in the Medical, Veterinary, and Public Health Curricula},

Abstract = {Introduction: The conceptual framework of One Health (OH) provides a
   strategy for promoting collaboration across the nexus of animal, human,
   and environmental health, which is essential for tackling emerging
   disease threats, such as COVID-19. However, there is no accreditation
   requirement for OH to prepare students across the professions for
   collaborative practice. This study aimed to explore the perspectives of
   faculty across the medical, veterinary, and public health programs about
   the need, opportunities, and challenges of developing OH in the
   curricula. Methods: In this qualitative study, faculty across the three
   disciplines were invited to participate in audio-recorded, focus group
   interviews. Recordings were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using
   inductive and deductive thematic analysis. Results: All participants
   recognized the need for OH as a critical concept for preparing students
   for collaborative practice. Opportunities were identified for shared
   learning and research across the disciplines, particularly through the
   use of interprofessional education. The lack of an accreditation mandate
   for OH in the medical curriculum was perceived to be the greatest
   challenge, leading to an anticipation of significant resistance among
   medical educators and students. Discussion: Successful development of OH
   in all three curricula is vital to prepare students for current and
   future threats to global health. The role of accreditation bodies in
   ensuring medical, veterinary, and public health curricula prepare
   students for these threats is crucial. Implications for practice include
   strategies for persuading medical educators and medical students to
   embrace OH in the curriculum and promote a culture of shared learning.},

Abstract = {In this article, by exploiting the event-triggered neural critic control
   scheme, the optimal control question of nonlinear continuous-time
   multiplayer nonzero-sum games with asymmetric control constraints is
   investigated. First, to satisfy the asymmetric constraints, we propose
   an appropriate nonquadratic function. Also, the time-based coupled
   Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations and the optimal control policies are
   deduced. To save communication resources and improve control efficiency,
   the event-driven mechanism is innovated. Further, the event-triggered
   optimal control strategies and the event-triggered coupled HJ equations
   are given. Afterwards, a novel triggering condition is established, and
   the critic neural networks are built to evaluate the optimal cost
   functions, thereby obtaining the event-triggered near-optimal controls.
   During neural critic learning, a new weight adjustment rule is proposed.
   Moreover, by exploiting the Lyapunov approach, the stability of the
   system state and the weight estimation errors is guaranteed. Finally,
   two examples are given to verify the efficacy of the established
   event-triggered neural critic control scheme.},

Abstract = {Wireless offloading in mobile-edge-computing (MEC)-enabled Internet of
   Things (IoT) networks inevitably suffers the risk of eavesdropping.
   Physical-layer security (PLS) approaches can be applied to prevent
   eavesdropping. However, the existing PLS techniques are not well
   targeted for videos due to the fact that video's distortion
   characteristics, which allow encoding parameters to be flexibly adjusted
   to enhance security in offloading, are ignored. A deep reinforcement
   learning (DRL)-based real-time, secure, and efficient video offloading
   scheme is proposed in this article, where video frame resolution, one
   key parameter of video's distortion characteristics, is introduced and
   jointly optimized with PLS scheme to guarantee video's security, improve
   users' Quality of Experience (QoE) and save energy consumption. We
   formulate a joint optimization problem of video frame resolution
   selection, computation offloading, and resource allocation strategy, to
   minimize energy consumption and maximize QoE in terms of delay and
   analytic accuracy, while subject to security rate, computing capability,
   and transmission power. To solve the formulated NP-hard problem with the
   form of high-dimensional nonlinear mixed-integer programming, the
   hierarchical reward-function-based DRL (JVFRS-CO-RA-MADDPG) algorithm is
   proposed to guide the agents to obtain the optimal policy efficiently.
   Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm
   outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of delay, energy
   consumption, and security level.},

Title = {Fine-Grained Compiler Identification With Sequence-Oriented Neural
   Modeling},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {49160-49175},
Abstract = {Different compilers and optimization levels can be used to compile the
   source code. Revealed in reverse from the produced binaries, these
   compiler details facilitate essential binary analysis tasks, such as
   malware analysis and software forensics. Most existing approaches adopt
   a signature matching based or machine learning based strategy to
   identify the compiler details, showing limits in either the detection
   accuracy or granularity. In this work, we propose NeuralCI (Neural
   modeling-based Compiler Identification) to infer these compiler details
   including compiler family, optimization level and compiler version on
   individual functions. The basic idea is to formulate sequence-oriented
   neural networks to process normalized instruction sequences generated
   using a lightweight function abstraction strategy. To evaluate the
   performance of NeuralCI, a large dataset consisting of 854,858 unique
   functions collected from 19 widely used real-world projects is
   constructed. The experiments show that NeuralCI achieves averagely
   98.6\% accuracy in identifying the compiler family, 95.3\% accuracy in
   identifying the optimization level, 88.7\% accuracy in identifying the
   compiler version, 94.8\% accuracy in identifying the compiler family and
   optimization level, and 83.0\% accuracy in identifying all compiler
   components simultaneously, outperforming existing function level
   compiler identification methods in terms of both detection accuracy and
   comprehensiveness.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To conduct the first study of intra- and postoperative
   outcomes related to intraoperative resident involvement in transurethral
   resection procedures for benign prostatic hyperplasia and bladder cancer
   in a large, multi-institutional database.
   DESIGN: Relying on the American College of Surgeons National Surgical
   Quality Improvement Program Participant User Files (2005-2012), we
   abstracted all cases of endoscopic prostate surgery (EPS) for benign
   prostatic hyperplasia and transurethral resection of bladder tumors
   (TURBTs). Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to
   assess the effect of trainee involvement (postgraduate year {[}PGY] 1-2:
   junior, PGY 3-4: senior, PGY 5: chief or fellow) vs attending only on
   operative time and length of hospital stay, as well as 30-day
   complication, reoperation, and readmission rates.
   RESULTS: In all, 5093 EPS and 3059 TURBTs for a total of 8152
   transurethral resection procedures were performed during the study
   period for which data on resident involvement were available. In
   multivariable analyses, resident involvement in EPS or TURBT was
   associated with increased odds of prolonged operative times and hospital
   readmissions in 30 days independent of resident level of training.
   Resident involvement was not associated with overall complications or
   reoperation rates.
   CONCLUSIONS: Resident involvement in lower urinary tract surgeries is
   associated with increased readmissions. Strategies to optimize resident
   teaching of these common urologic procedures in order to minimize
   possible risks to patients should be explored. (C) 2015 Association of

Abstract = {Background: Engineering education must prepare students to assume
   professional and ethical responsibility for the societal impacts of
   technology, but most engineering students do not receive adequate ethics
   teaching. In fact, engineering education has been described as
   characterized by a ``culture of disengagement{''} in which ethical and
   societal concerns are constructed as different from and less important
   than purely technical concerns.
   Purpose/Hypothesis: This study explores how a culture of disengagement
   is discursively constructed and perpetuated in engineering education by
   analyzing the discursive construction of ethics and ethical reflection
   in an introductory engineering course in Sweden.
   Design/Method: The study is based on extensive ethnographic data in the
   form of field notes, lecture recordings, interview data, and course
   documents. The data are analyzed using a discourse analytic approach
   rooted in discourse theory.
   Results: The results illustrate five processes through which ethics and
   ethical reflection are articulated as not the responsibility of the
   specific field of engineering, irrelevant for the profession, of low
   quality and status, and not very important for the engineering degree.
   Conclusions: The results contribute to understanding how a culture of
   disengagement may be perpetuated in engineering education. The results
   also point toward pedagogical tools and strategies that instructors and
   program managers can use to construct ethics and ethical reflection as
   an advanced skill that is an important and integral part of engineering
   and engineering education-and thus better prepare future engineers to
   become responsible professionals.},

Title = {Perceptions and Use of iPad Technology by Pharmacy Practice Faculty
   Members},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {78},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Objectives. To explore the potential of tablet technology to address the
   specific workload challenges of pharmacy practice faculty members and to
   evaluate tablet usage after a department-wide iPad initiative.
   Methods. After conducting a needs assessment to determine pharmacy
   faculty attitudes towards tablet technology and to identify potential
   usage scenarios, all faculty members in a department of pharmacy
   practice received an iPad. After iPad distribution, training sessions
   and virtual tutorials were provided. An anonymous survey was
   administered to evaluate the pilot.
   Results. The needs assessment survey revealed positive attitudes towards
   iPad technology, identified use scenarios, and led to a department-wide
   iPad pilot program. Most faculty members used iPads for connectivity
   with students (86\%), paper/project annotation (68\%), assessment
   (57\%), and demonstration of tools used in practice (36\%). For
   teaching, 61\% of faculty members used iPads in seminars/laboratories,
   57\% used iPads in the experiential setting, and 43\% used iPads in the
   classroom. Use of iPads for patient-care activities varied and depended
   on site support for mobile technology. The 23 faculty members with
   external practice sites used iPads to a greater extent and had more
   positive attitudes towards this technology compared with campus-based
   faculty members.
   Conclusion. Integration of tablet technology into the pharmacy education
   setting resulted in faculty-reported increased productivity and
   decreased paper waste. It also allowed faculty members to experiment
   with new teaching strategies in the classroom and experiential setting.
   Administrators at institutions exploring the use of tablet technology
   should allocate resources based on faculty needs and usage patterns.},

Title = {Quality of Service-Aware Resource Selection in Healthcare IoT Using Deep
   Autoencoder Neural Networks},
Journal = {HUMAN-CENTRIC COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Heterogeneous network and device-to-device communication are two
   possible solutions for improving wireless network spectral efficiency.
   Techniques based on the Internet of Things (IoT) can interact between a
   large number of smart devices as well as heterogeneous networks. The
   goal of this study is to investigate proposed quality of service-aware
   resource selection in an IoT network for healthcare data using a deep
   auto encoder neural network with spectrum reuse utilizing mixed integer
   nonlinear programming (MINLP). The suggested MINLP spectrum reuse was
   used to address the optimization problem, and the spectrum allocation
   was done using fast Fourier transform based reinforcement Q-learning.
   Increased transmission repetitions have been identified as a promising
   strategy for improving IoT coverage by up to 164 dB in terms of maximum
   coupling loss for uplink transmissions, which is a significant
   improvement over traditional LTE technology, particularly for serving
   customers in deep coverage. Based on a comparison of existing
   methodologies, the experimental study is performed using parameters such
   as bit error rate of 40\%, signal-to-interference plus noise ratio of
   72\%, sum rate of 88\%, and spectral efficiency of 98\%.},

Abstract = {BackgroundExamining the predictors of summative assessment performance
   is important for improving educational programs and structuring
   appropriate learning environments for trainees. However, predictors of
   certification examination performance in pediatric postgraduate
   education have not been comprehensively investigated in Japan.MethodsThe
   Pediatric Board Examination database in Japan, which includes 1578
   postgraduate trainees from 2015 to 2016, was analyzed. The examinations
   included multiple-choice questions (MCQs), case summary reports, and an
   interview, and the predictors for each of these components were
   investigated by multiple regression analysis.ResultsThe number of
   examination attempts and the training duration were significant negative
   predictors of the scores for the MCQ, case summary, and interview.
   Employment at a community hospital or private university hospital were
   negative predictors of the MCQ and case summary score, respectively.
   Female sex and the number of academic presentations positively predicted
   the case summary and interview scores. The number of research
   publications was a positive predictor of the MCQ score, and employment
   at a community hospital was a positive predictor of the case summary
   score.ConclusionThis study found that delayed and repeated examination
   taking were negative predictors, while the scholarly activity of
   trainees was a positive predictor, of pediatric board certification
   examination performance.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {12807-12819},
Abstract = {In multi-view clustering, an eigen-decomposition of the Laplacian matrix
   of the graph is usually necessary. This leads to a significant increase
   in time cost and also requires post-processing such as \$k\$ -means. In
   addition, some methods require learning a uniform graph matrix. In
   large-scale data, this process significantly increase time and memory
   costs. To address these problems, this paper proposes Fast Multi-view
   Clustering (FMvC). First, non-negative constraints are added to the
   objective function from the unified view of relaxed normalized and ratio
   cuts. Then, graph reconstruction is performed on the similarity matrix
   using an indication matrix to ensure that the obtained graph has robust
   intra-cluster and weak inter-cluster connectivity. Besides, the
   operation speed of the method can be further enhanced by setting a
   common labeling matrix. Finally, the problem is solved optimally based
   on the strategy of alternating directional multipliers. Experimental
   results on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the proposed algorithm, which can always outperform eleven existing
   baseline algorithms.},

Title = {Barriers and enablers to retention of Aboriginal Diploma of Nursing
   students in Western Australia: An exploratory descriptive study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {17-22},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Nursing education appropriate to the learning needs of
   Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students is essential to prepare
   them for registration as nurses. Despite incentives to encourage the
   recruitment and retention of such students, a disproportionate number
   commence but do not finish their nursing studies.
   Objectives: To describe the barriers and enablers to the retention of
   Aboriginal students in a Diploma of Nursing course (Enrolled/Division 2)
   in Western Australia.
   Design: An exploratory descriptive design was used.
   Settings: One metropolitan educational facility catering for Aboriginal
   people offering an 18-month course in a block release format.
   Participants: A convenience sample of 16 students aged 18+ years.
   Methods: Newly enrolled students (n = 10) participated in an
   investigator-developed survey to explore their motivation for entering
   the course. Nine of these students and a further seven students who were
   nearing the end of their course participated in focus groups to explore
   their experiences of nursing education.
   Results: Survey respondents had a mean age of 32.7 years; most were
   female, had nominated family as influential in the decision to enroll,
   and commenced with a friend. Regarding recruitment and retention, the
   qualitative data highlighted the importance of students': perceptions of
   the training organisation, characteristics, experiences of nursing
   education, and sources of support
   Conclusions: Strategies that develop individual's resilience and engage
   supportive networks can assist Aboriginal students to negotiate tertiary
   nursing study. Academic skills assessments supplemented with tailored
   educational support at entry can resource students to navigate
   increasingly complex course content Flexibility throughout the course
   enables students to negotiate study in a context of ongoing family and
   financial obligations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Feeling a sense of belonging in a learning environment can have positive
   effects on student success. The impact of this psychosocial variable on
   undergraduates' achievement and retention has been demonstrated in STEM
   disciplines, especially for women within physical sciences where large
   disparities in gender representation persist. The current study explores
   the relationship between belonging and student success in undergraduate
   chemistry, where greater gender parity has recently emerged. In
   particular, this research investigates the belonging of first-year
   students enrolled in a two-semester General Chemistry course sequence.
   The study begins by examining whether students' early sense of belonging
   in the course, indexed by two survey measures (perceived belonging,
   belonging uncertainty) varies depending on their demographics and
   academic preparation. The belonging measures are then used as predictors
   of performance in General Chemistry 1 and 2 and attrition from one
   semester to the next. Paralleling research in other STEM disciplines,
   the results show that female students, especially those from
   underrepresented minority groups, reported lower belonging and higher
   uncertainty than male students within the first weeks of the course.
   After accounting for demographics, preparation, and participation in a
   course supplemental program, the belonging measures predicted
   performance and attrition for all students. These findings suggest that
   course-level belonging in General Chemistry can have practical
   consequences for student success, and early disparities in belonging may
   have downstream effects on the retention of women and other groups
   underrepresented in STEM. Strategies for creating an inclusive and
   engaging environment that supports the success of all students are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Issue: Despite clear relevance, need, descriptive literature, and
   student interest, few schools offer required curriculum to develop
   leadership skills. This paper outlines a proposed shared vision for
   leadership development drawn from a coalition of diverse medical
   schools. We advocate that leadership development is about self (looking
   inward), teams (not hierarchy), and change (looking outward). We propose
   that leadership development is for all medical students, not for a
   subset, and we believe that leadership curricula and programs must be
   experiential and applied. Evidence: This paper also draws on the current
   literature and the experience of medical schools participating in the
   American Medical Association's (AMA) Accelerating Change in Medical
   Education Consortium, confronts the common arguments against leadership
   training in medical education, and provides three cross-cutting
   principles that we believe must each be incorporated in all medical
   student-centered leadership development programs as they emerge and
   evolve at medical schools. Implications: By confronting common arguments
   against leadership training and providing a framework for such training,
   we give medical educators important tools and insights into developing
   leadership training for all students at their institutions.},

Abstract = {This paper reports a study which demonstrates the advantages of using
   virtual-reality-based systems for training automotive assembly tasks.
   Sixty participants were randomly assigned to one of the following three
   training experiences to learn a car service procedure: (1) observational
   training through video instruction; (2) an experiential virtual training
   and trial in a CAVE; and (3) an experiential virtual training and trial
   through a portable 3D interactive table. Results show that virtual
   trained participants, after the training, can remember significantly
   better (p < .05) the correct execution of the steps compared to
   video-trained trainees. No significant differences were identified
   between the experiential groups neither in terms of post-training
   performances nor in terms of proficiency, despite differences in the
   interaction devices. The relevance of the outcomes for the automotive
   fields and for the designers of virtual training applications are
   discussed in light of the outcomes, particularly that virtual training
   experienced through a portable device such as the interactive table can
   be effective, as can training performed in a CAVE. This suggests the
   possibility for automotive industries to invest in advanced portable
   hardware to deliver effectively long-distance programs of training for
   car service operators placed all over the world.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   To report findings from a national effort initiated by three primary
   care certifying boards to catalyze change in primary care training.
   Method
   In this mixed-method pilot study ( 2012-2014), 36 faculty in 12 primary
   care residencies ( family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics) from
   four institutions participated in a professional development program
   designed to prepare faculty to accelerate change in primary care
   residency training by uniting them in a common mission to create
   effective ambulatory clinical learning environments. Surveys
   administered at baseline and 12 months after initial training measured
   changes in faculty members' confidence and skills, continuity clinics,
   and residency training programs. Feasibility evaluation involved
   assessing participation. The authors compared quantitative data using
   Wilcoxon signed-rank and Bhapkar tests. Observational field notes
   underwent narrative analysis.
   Results
   Most participants attended two in-person training sessions ( 92\% and
   72\%, respectively). Between baseline and 12 months, faculty members'
   confidence in leadership improved significantly for 15/ 19 ( 79\%)
   variables assessed; their self-assessed skills improved significantly
   for 21/22 ( 95\%) competencies. Two medical home domains ({''}Continuity
   of Care,{''} ``Support/Care Coordination{''}) improved significantly ( P
   < .05) between the two time periods. Analyses of qualitative data
   revealed that interdisciplinary learning communities formed during the
   program and served to catalyze transformational change.
   Conclusions
   Results suggest that improvements in faculty perceptions of confidence
   and skills occurred and that the creation of interdisciplinary learning
   communities catalyzed transformation. Lengthening the intervention
   period, engaging other professions involved in training the primary care
   workforce, and a more discriminating evaluation design are needed to
   scale this model nationally.},

Title = {Intervention Algorithm of Horse Racing for Students' Psychological
   Disorders Based on Big Data},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUL 31},
Abstract = {Horse racing is a competitive activity in which humans control horses.
   It is a worldwide traditional sports activity. In the history of
   human-horse racing, horse racing activities in various eras have been
   followed but also constantly innovated. According to the K-means
   clustering algorithm, a cluster analysis model is constructed for the
   model, and the algorithm model is applied to the students' mental health
   counseling work. After six iterations to get the classification and six
   iterations of the cluster center algorithm, it was found that the mixed
   psychological population accounted for 50\%. Horse racing can not only
   effectively relieve students' psychological problems and exercise
   students' willpower and thinking ability, but also promote traditional
   sports. Through K-means clustering algorithm research, frame design, and
   program design, a complete psychological disorder intervention system is
   established, which provides scientific, objective, and reliable data
   guarantee for the correct implementation of decision-making strategies.
   Integrating cluster analysis into the process of students' mental health
   analysis makes it easier for decision-makers to understand and master
   all aspects of students' information, to analyze and customize solutions
   for different types of students. It provides a good foundation for
   providing different psychotherapeutic methods for different groups of
   students.},

Title = {Behavior and Cognition Processing of Educational Tabletop Coding Games},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {363-370},
Abstract = {Many countries have been actively promoting computational thinking since
   it was put forward, and visual programming language, robots and
   educational tabletop games are commonly used in its promotion. To
   understand the relationship between students' learning of coding
   principles in educational tabletop games and players' cognitive
   processing at key points in time, students' behavior while playing the
   Interstellar Explorer tabletop game was observed by a brainwave EEG
   (electroencephalography) instrument and video and analyzed with
   cognitive processing. The results showed that a continuous increase in
   attention and meditation reflected a low level of knowledge and
   understanding as well as high-level application, analysis and evaluation
   of cognitive processing. This study explores the relationship between
   the state of students playing tabletop games and their behavior during
   play and then derives the relationship between their behavior and
   cognitive processing. It is recommended that the design of tabletop
   games consider how the learning content matches the game mechanics and
   examine whether cognitive processing is present according to Bloom's
   taxonomy. In addition, to enhance players' cognitive ability, it is
   recommended that tabletop games provide the ability to use contextual
   content and multiple strategies.},

Title = {Cooperative Operation Framework for a Wind-Solar-CCHP Multi-Energy
   System Based on Nash Bargaining Solution},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {119987-120000},
Abstract = {A multi-energy system can supply both electric and thermal energy
   simultaneously to the end-users to achieve a high energy use-efficiency.
   However conventional operational strategies for multi-energy systems, in
   the existing works, do not consider renewable energy generation plants
   and CCHP plants as belonging to different interests. To cope with this
   problem, this article studies a cooperative operation framework model
   for a Wind-Solar-CCHP Multi-energy system. Instead of the conventional
   non-cooperative solution-based method, the optimal operation scheduling
   problem of a multi-energy system is described as an optimization problem
   of Nash Bargaining. Then the optimization problem of Nash Bargaining for
   the multi-energy system decomposed into two subproblems: social welfare
   maximization problem (P1) and energy trading payment problem (P2). The
   optimal energy transaction profiles can be obtained by solving the P1
   problem and the problem of payment of energy trading between PV, WT
   plant agents and the CCHP plant agent can be obtained by solving the P2
   problem. Both problems P1 and P2 can be formulated into mixed-integer
   linear programming problems and solved by the alternating directional
   multiplier method. Numerical studies demonstrate the correctness and
   effectiveness of the proposed cooperative operation framework and
   distributed algorithm for solving the two subproblems. Moreover, the
   bargaining-based cooperative operation method can further induce the
   multi-energy system to improve the operating profit with the reduced
   feed-in tariff of distributed generation.},

Title = {Development of Linear Regression Models to Estimate the Margin of
   Stability Based on Spatio-Temporal Gait Parameters},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {19853-19859},
Abstract = {Spatio-temporal gait parameters such as step width, cadence, stride
   length, and walking speed contribute to dynamic stability. Several
   studies have investigated the role of gait parameters in maintaining
   balance. However, in these studies, subjects were instructed to alter
   their gait. This intentional alteration has the potential to create
   error in the results, as subjects are not walking with a natural and
   comfortable gait. In consideration of this, the sample chosen in this
   study consisted of patients who had undergone a knee replacement. Such
   individuals naturally have gait parameters that differ from normal
   subjects. The primary objective of this study was to develop regression
   models that predict and measure gait stability in both the
   anterior-posterior and medio-lateral directions based on gait
   parameters. The maximum deviation of the extrapolated center of mass
   from the border of the base of support was the measure of gait
   stability. A forward stepwise multiple regression analysis was conducted
   to develop both models. In testing the goodness of fit of models, the
   values of coefficient of determination, standard error of estimates, and
   root mean square error were calculated. Both models showed sufficient
   values of goodness of fit. To improve walking stability and minimize
   falls, fall-prone people should walk with an adequate base-of-support
   area, and with lower cadence and speed. The results of this study
   contribute to an understanding of gait patterns and their relationship
   to walking stability and to how gait strategies might be taught in
   physical therapy programs to minimize the risk of falls.},

Title = {Optimal Power Generation in Energy-Deficient Scenarios Using Bagging
   Ensembles},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {155917-155929},
Abstract = {This paper presents an improved technique for optimal power generation
   using ensemble artificial neural networks (EANN). The motive for using
   EANN is to benefit from multiple parallel processor computing rather
   than traditional serial computation to reduce bias and variance in
   machine learning. The load data is obtained from the load regulation
   authority of Pakistan for 24 hours. The data is analyzed on an IEEE
   30-bus test system by implementing two approaches; the conventional
   artificial neural network (ANN) with feed-forward back-propagation model
   and a Bagging algorithm. To improve the training of ANN and authenticate
   its result, first the Load Flow Analysis (LFA) on IEEE 30 bus is
   performed using Newton Raphson Method and then the program is developed
   in MATLAB using Lagrange relaxation (LR) framework to solve a
   power-generator scheduling problem. The bootstraps for the EANN are
   obtained through a disjoint partition Bagging algorithm to handle the
   fluctuating power demand and is used to forecast the power generation.
   The results of MATLAB simulations are analyzed and compared along with
   computational complexity, therein showing the dominance of the EANN over
   the traditional ANN strategy that closed to LR.},

   and methods used to study these topics. MEDLINE, Social Sciences
   Abstracts and ERIC electronic databases were searched. 817 full text
   articles from 2002 to 2012 were screened; 624 articles were included in
   the review.
   Results: The following research topic areas were identified: continuing
   education, curriculum development, undergraduate education, teaching
   methods, assessment techniques, selection of entrants, non-clinical
   skills, professional and faculty development, clinical decision-making
   and resident well-being. Quantitative studies comprised the large
   majority of research approaches; overall minimal methodological details
   were provided.
   Conclusions: Our review highlights an overall need for increased
   sophisticated in methodological approaches to education research in
   family medicine, a problem that could be ameliorated by multiple
   strategies including better engagement of methodologists throughout the
   research process. The results provide guidance for future family
   medicine education research programs.},

Abstract = {Introduction:Infectious disease training is considered vital in health
   care systems to improve knowledge, skills, and work performance of
   infection control professionals. However, the extent to which trainees
   effectively transfer knowledge, skills, and attitudes that they acquire
   through training has received little attention. This study aimed to
   identify factors influencing training transfer of infection control
   professionals receiving infectious disease training.Methods:This
   cross-sectional study selected infection control professionals who
   completed an infectious disease training program provided by Korea Human
   Resources Development Institute for Health and Welfare. A self-reported
   questionnaire was used to collect data on sociodemographic variables,
   trainee characteristics, training design, work environment, and training
   transfer. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS (version
   26.0).Results:The mean age of the 139 participants was 41.45 years, and
   77\% were female participants. Regression analysis indicated that the
   following factors significantly influenced the training transfer of
   infection control professionals and thereby decrease morbidity and
   mortality: for trainee characteristics, transfer experience (beta =
   0.205, P = 0.012) and motivation to learn (beta = 0.196, P =0.016); for
   training design, learning objectives (beta = 0.269, P = 0.021), goals
   (beta = 0.356, P =0.023), and methods (beta = 0.365, P = 0.020); and for
   the work environment, supervisor support (beta = 0.275, P =0.024) and
   colleague support (beta = 0.474, P = 0.022).Conclusion:Future training
   programs for improving training transfer should focus more on strategies
   to improve the motivation for training transfer. Trainees should be
   guided on (1) how to apply training knowledge in specific clinical
   contexts to improve their performance and (2) potential methods to get
   support from their supervisors and colleagues during training.},

Title = {An undergraduate medical education framework for refugee and migrant

Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},

Month = {MAY 16},
Abstract = {Background International migration, especially forced migration,
   highlights important medical training needs including cross-cultural
   communication, human rights, as well as global health competencies for
   physical and mental healthcare. This paper responds to the call for a
   `trauma informed' refugee health curriculum framework from medical
   students and global health faculty. Methods We used a mixed-methods
   approach to develop a guiding medical undergraduate refugee and migrant
   health curriculum framework. We conducted a scoping review, key
   informant interviews with global health faculty with follow-up
   e-surveys, and then, integrated our results into a competency-based
   curriculum framework with values and principles, learning objectives and
   curriculum delivery methods and evaluation. Results The majority of our
   Canadian medical faculty respondents reported some refugee health
   learning objectives within their undergraduate medical curriculum. The
   most prevalent learning objective topics included access to care
   barriers, social determinants of health for refugees, cross-cultural
   communication skills, global health epidemiology, challenges and
   pitfalls of providing care and mental health. We proposed a curriculum
   framework that incorporates values and principles, competency-based
   learning objectives, curriculum delivery (i.e., community service
   learning), and evaluation methods. Conclusions The results of this study
   informed the development of a curriculum framework that integrates
   cross-cultural communication skills, exploration of barriers towards
   accessing care for newcomers, and system approaches to improve refugee
   and migrant healthcare. Programs should also consider social
   determinants of health, community service learning and the development
   of links to community resettlement and refugee organizations.},

Abstract = {With the growing popularity of data mashups, the number of Web APIs has
   increased significantly. As a result, finding and composing the right
   APIs has become an increasingly complex task. Although several tools
   such as Yahoo's Pipes, IBM's Lotus Mashup, and Intel's Mashmaker have
   been developed to enable users to create data mashups without
   programming skills, there are several challenging issues when combining
   a large number of APIs into the data mashup. This paper proposes novel
   algorithms for the automatic discovery and composition of Web APIs. Our
   discovery algorithm adopts strategies that rapidly prune APIs that are
   guaranteed not to match the query. Our composition algorithm consists of
   constructing a composable similarity graph (CSG) and searching
   composition candidates. The CSG presents the semantic functional
   dependency between the inputs and the outputs of the Web APIs. Using
   this graph, we generate directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that can produce
   the output satisfying the desired goal. We evaluate the algorithms on a
   real-world dataset from ProgrammableWeb.com, and show that they can
   produce the results satisfying the user's desired output.},

Abstract = {Resilience is a dynamic and multifaceted process in which individuals
   draw on personal and contextual resources. In difficult situations,
   resilient people use specific strategies to learn from the situation
   without being overcome by it. As stressors are inherent to veterinary
   work, including long work hours, ethical dilemmas, and challenging
   interactions with clients, resilience is an important component of
   professional quality of life. However, while resilience in other health
   professionals has received attention, it has received little in the
   veterinary field. In this cross-sectional study, veterinary students
   from six veterinary schools in Australia completed an online survey,
   with 193 responses (23\%). Very few veterinary students (6\%) reached
   the threshold to be considered highly resilient using the Brief
   Resilience Scale, and approximately one third classified as having low
   levels of resilience. In the final linear multiple regression model,
   predictors of resilience included nonjudgmental and nonreactive
   mindfulness (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire) and self-compassion
   (Neff Self-Compassion Scale). Students with higher nonjudgmental and
   nonreactive mindfulness and self-compassion had higher resilience
   scores. These findings indicate that fostering these qualities of
   mindfulness and self-compassion may be aligned with strengthening
   veterinary student resilience. Importantly, if the factors that help
   veterinary students develop a capacity for resilience can be identified,
   intervention programs can be targeted to educate future veterinary
   professionals with a high quality of life, both professional and
   personal.},

   From 2014 to 2019, the authors used a previously developed survey to
   assess factors related to resident burnout, including sleep, personal
   time, professional fulfillment, effects on relationships, program
   recognition, and peer support. At Hennepin Healthcare, a safety-net
   hospital in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the authors created a reproducible
   process for collecting data from internal medicine residents annually,
   and for using evidence-based conceptual frameworks to develop a
   continuous improvement method to address worklife across training years.
   Interventions included jeopardy coverage for essential life events, a
   newsletter celebrating resident achievements, removal of after-hours
   consult pager call, an extra day off for senior residents on the wards,
   and care packages distributed to night teams.
   Outcomes
   Annually from 2014 to 2019, 40/66 (60.6\%) to 62/73 residents (84.9\%)
   completed the survey (average response rate was 72.1\% over 6 years).
   Survey results were shared with residents in multiple formats, and
   feedback was requested, demonstrating that burnout reduction is a
   priority for program leadership. High professional fulfillment scores
   were documented every year. Self-reported rates of burnout were between
   25\% and 35\%. Significant improvements were seen in perception of
   empathy, sleep impairment, and peer support.
   Next Steps
   The authors developed a plan for minimizing burnout, which includes the
   following evidence-based domains: workload, control, balance in effort
   and reward, work-life balance, fairness, values, support, gender equity,
   moral distress, and moral injury. Additional interventions include
   protected time for didactics, trauma-informed care training, and
   addressing workplace racism. The authors aspire to achieve an integrated
   culture of well-being for residents and faculty; foster an efficient,
   effective, and fair learning environment; and reduce-and ultimately
   eliminate-burnout.},

Title = {From Burnout to Wholehearted Engagement: A Qualitative Exploration of
   Psychiatry Residents' Experience of Stress},

Abstract = {Purpose
   Physician burnout is endemic across medical education and has numerous
   deleterious effects. Given the prevalence and negative effects of
   burnout, there is an urgent need to understand how residents experience
   and cope with stress and develop explanatory models that inform the
   development of more effective interventions.
   Method
   Using a qualitative, constructivist approach informed by grounded
   theory, the authors conducted semistructured interviews from March to
   April 2019, in which psychiatry residents were asked about their
   experiences of stress and how they coped. First- through fourth-year
   trainees at Zucker Hillside Hospital at Northwell Health, Glen Oaks, New
   York, were invited. Two authors independently and inductively coded
   deidentified transcripts. A constant comparative approach was used to
   analyze data and support construction of themes. Theoretic sufficiency
   was observed after 14 interviews.
   Results
   The authors constructed an explanatory model for how residents cope with
   stress and whether they tended toward burnout or wholehearted
   engagement. The model included 3 themes: self-care, work relationships,
   and meaning making. Self-care, including time spent with others,
   provided connection and belonging that bolstered physicians' developing
   identities. Interpersonal relationships at work profoundly influenced
   the experience of residents. Positive peer and supervisor relationships
   enhanced confidence and perseverance. Negative role models and conflict
   engendered feelings of inadequacy. The ability to shift perspective and
   build meaning through examining moral values in the face of challenges
   was crucial for residents who reported success at coping with stress.
   Residents identified personal psychotherapy as an especially important
   strategy to facilitate meaning making.
   Conclusions
   These findings provide guidance for how residency programs may help
   residents cope with stress and move away from burnout toward
   wholehearted engagement. Strategies may include reducing barriers to
   self-care and to accessing help early in training, creating spaces that
   promote peer connection and providing training in addressing conflict,
   and facilitating engagement in meaning-making activities.},

Title = {Institution-Specific Factors Associated With Family Medicine Residency
   Match Rates},
Journal = {TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {269-278},
Abstract = {Phenomenon: Existing research provides little specific evidence
   regarding the association between public and private medical school
   curricular settings and the proportion of medical students matching into
   family medicine careers. Institutional differences have been
   inadequately investigated, as students who match into family medicine
   are often consolidated into the umbrella of primary care along with
   those matching in internal medicine and pediatrics. However,
   understanding medical school contexts in relation to career choice is
   critical toward designing targeted strategies to address the projected
   shortage of family physicians. This study examines factors associated
   with family medicine residency match rates and the extent to which such
   factors differ across medical school settings. Approach: We combined
   data from a survey of 123 departments of family medicine with graduate
   placement rates reported to the American Academy of Family Physicians
   over a 2-year period. Chi-square/Fisher's Exact texts, t tests, and
   linear regression analyses were used to identify factors significantly
   associated with average match rate percentages. Findings: The resulting
   data set included 85\% of the U.S. medical schools with Departments of
   Family Medicine that reported 2011 and 2012 residency match rates in
   family medicine. Match rates in family medicine were higher among
   graduates of public than private medical schools11\% versus 7\%,
   respectively, t(92) = 4.00, p < .001. Using a linear regression model
   and controlling for institutional type, the results indicated2\% higher
   match ratesamongschools with smaller annual clerkship enrollments (p =
   .03), 3\% higher match rates among schools with clerkships lasting more
   than 3 to 4 weeks (p = .003), 3\% higher match rates atschools withat
   least 1 family medicinefaculty member in a senior leadership role (p =
   .04), and 8\% lower match rates at private medical schools offering
   community medicine electives (p < .001, R-2 = .48), F(6, 64) = 9.95, p <
   .001.Three additional factors were less strongly related and varied by
   institutional typeinformal mentoring, ambulatory primary care learning
   experiences, and institutional research focus. Insights: Educational
   opportunities associated with higher match rates in family medicine
   differ across private and public medical schools. Future research is
   needed to identify the qualitative aspects of educational programming
   that contribute to differences in match rates across institutional
   contexts. Results of this study should prove useful in mitigating
   physician shortages, particularly in primary care fields such as family
   medicine.},

Abstract = {In many applications such as transaction data analysis, the
   classification of long chains of sequences is required. For example,
   brand purchase history in customer transaction data is in a form like
   AABCABAA, where A, B, and C are brands of a consumer product. The
   decision tree-based package mbonsai is designed to handle sequence data
   of varying lengths using one or multiple variables of interest as
   predictor variables. This software package uses tree growing and pruning
   strategies adopted from C4.5 and CART algorithms, and includes new
   features for handling sequence data and indexing for classification
   purpose. The software uses a simple command line program for learning
   and predicting processes, and has the ability to generate user-friendly
   graphics depicting decision trees. The underlying C++ codes are designed
   to efficiently process large data sets in ASCII files. Two examples from
   transaction data sets are used to illustrate the application of mbonsai.},

Title = {Enhancing Medical Student Education and Combating Mistreatment During a
   Surgery Clerkship With a Novel Educational Tool: A Pilot Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {78},
Number = {1},
Pages = {76-82},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medical education changes dramatically from preclinical to
   clinical years, and the learning environment becomes key as students
   strive to develop clinical competence and informed career decisions.
   This change becomes heightened on a surgical clerkship where student
   mistreatment is often perceived, and the fast-paced nature of surgery
   can result in limited resident-student interactions and time for
   examination preparation.
   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate medical student and resident perception of
   educational strategies during a surgical clerkship and to determine
   whether the addition of a novel educational tool would increase
   satisfaction with the surgical clerkship on examination preparation and
   team dynamics.
   SETTING: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Department of
   Surgery.
   STUDY DESIGN: During the 2018-2019 academic year, a 10-item ``Ask a
   Resident Topics{''} (ART) card of high yield general surgery topics was
   implemented as part of the third-year surgery clerkship curriculum.
   Students were asked to review a topic and then discuss it with a general
   surgery resident. They were expected to complete at least 6 of 10 topics
   by the end of the rotation for credit. At the end of the year,
   third-year medical students were administered a 23-item survey regarding
   their experience on the surgery clerkship and with the ART cards.
   Fourth-year medical students and those students at satellite sites who
   did not receive the ART cards were administered the same survey, minus
   specific questions about the ART card, and were used as a
   preintervention control. General surgery residents who participated in
   teaching were similarly surveyed.
   RESULTS: Of those students that completed the ART cards, 84\% felt it
   improved their understanding of general surgery and were more likely to
   report the surgery clerkship prepared them well for the NBME examination
   compared to those who did not (X-2 (1, N = 87) = 4.95, p = 0.03). They
   were also more likely to report residents were willing to discuss
   surgery topics with them (X-2 (1, N = 87) = 2.77, p = 0.10).
   Seventy-three percent of students thought the card did not add undue
   stress to their clerkship. Sixty-three percent of all students felt they
   were a productive member of the surgery team, and this did not vary by
   intervention group (X-2 (1, N = 87) = 0.03, p = 0.9). Students who
   completed the ART card were more likely to report being interested in
   surgery than those who did not (X-2 (1, N = 87) = 4.20, p = 0.04).
   Hundred percent of residents surveyed felt the ART card provided value
   for themselves as a teacher and for the student as a learner.
   CONCLUSIONS: The ART card is mutually beneficial to both residents and
   medical students during the surgical clerkship. This tool is easy to
   implement, helps students improve their understanding of general
   surgery, increases camaraderie among the surgical team, and has a
   positive impact on students pursuing a career in surgery. (C) 2020

Title = {Eight years' experience with a Medical Education Journal Club in Mexico:
   a quasi-experimental one-group study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Month = {DEC 14},
Abstract = {Background: A time-honored strategy for keeping up to date in medicine
   and improving critical appraisal skills is the Journal Club (JC). There
   are several reports of its use in medicine and allied health sciences
   but almost no reports of JC focused on medical education. The purpose of
   the study is to describe and evaluate an eight years' experience with a
   medical education Journal Club (MEJC).
   Methods: We started a monthly medical education JC in 2006 at UNAM
   Faculty of Medicine in Mexico City. Its goal is to provide faculty with
   continuing professional development in medical education. A discussion
   guide and a published paper were sent 2 weeks before sessions. We
   reviewed the themes and publication types of the papers used in the
   sessions, and in June-July 2014 administered a retrospective
   post-then-pre evaluation questionnaire to current participants that had
   been regular attendees to the JC for more than 2 years. The
   retrospective post-then-pre comparisons were analyzed with Wilcoxon
   signed-rank test. Effect sizes were calculated for the pre-post
   comparisons with Cohen's r.
   Results: There have been 94 MEJC sessions until July 2014. Average
   attendance is 20 persons, a mix of clinicians, educators, psychologists
   and a sociologist. The articles were published in 32 different journals,
   and covered several medical education themes (curriculum, faculty
   development, educational research methodology, learning methods,
   assessment, residency education). 22 Attendees answered the evaluation
   instrument. The MEJC had a positive evaluation from good to excellent,
   and there was an improvement in self-reported competencies in medical
   education literature critical appraisal and behaviors related to the use
   of evidence in educational practice, with a median effect size higher
   than 0.5. The evaluation instrument had a Cronbach's alpha of 0.96.
   Conclusions: A periodic Medical Education Journal Club can improve
   critical appraisal of the literature, and be maintained long-term using
   evidence-based strategies. This activity is a useful adjunct to the
   scholarship of teaching.},

Title = {Development of collaborative family nurse practitioner education using
   physician preceptors: A focused critical ethnographic study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {107},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Global oppressive power structures in healthcare systems and
   between professions hinder care delivery. The family nurse practitioner
   is a new role in Israel. Through an innovative international
   collaborative education partnership, 19 Israeli nurses were trained as
   family nurse practitioners. Israeli physician preceptors integrated them
   into a national health maintenance organization despite national and
   organizational resistance. Objectives: Explore Israeli physicians'
   experiences while providing clinical mentorship to family nurse
   practitioners and develop strategies for the implementation of the new
   community role. Design: Qualitative focused critical ethnographic
   approach. Participants: Eleven Israeli physician preceptors were
   recruited from a larger pool of 50. Methods: Physicians were interviewed
   via recorded phone calls and asked open-ended questions about precepting
   family nurse practitioners. Observations of the program were included
   from the year prior to the interviews. Data were analyzed using
   Carspecken's five steps for critical ethnographic approach. Results:
   Three categories for transforming the current status were identified:
   role clarification, logistics, and collaborative education. Exemplar
   cases described collaborative practice regarding measurable outcomes.
   Learning happened through ``shadowing{''} and ``coaching{''} techniques.
   Findings led to the Collaborative Team Development Illustration which
   mirrors current recommendations from the World Health Organization and
   Institute of Medicine. Conclusions: The Collaborative Team Development
   Illustration offers a structured strategy for advocacy and
   transformation in other oppressive health systems considering
   introducing nurse practitioners. This paper provides evidence that
   physician participants believed partnerships with nurse practitioners
   could improve patient care delivery. We hope this research will
   contribute to changing power relations in healthcare and improve
   outcomes. This may offer hope for integration of family nurse
   practitioners in countries that currently do not support advanced
   practice nursing roles.},

Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {One of the most challenging control problems has been the speed control
   of an alternating current (AC) motor due to the highly nonlinear
   characteristics and many uncertain parameters including the magnetic
   flux, temperature-dependent rotor resistance, and the variable load. In
   this study, an intelligent control algorithm is proposed for the AC
   motor speed control using a PID controller-based backpropagation neural
   network (BP-NN). The momentum factor adaptive learning rate algorithm is
   introduced to improve the PID-based BP-NN. A simulation model
   representing the complete AC motor speed regulation system is
   established and tested using the MATLAB program. The simulation results
   show that this control strategy has strong adaptability and robustness
   when the controlled object is unknown or the parameters change. Compared
   with other PID and neural network parameter adjustment methods, the
   model has the potential to intelligently regulate the speed of the AC
   motor.},

Title = {A Systematic Mapping of the Classification of Open Educational Resources
   for Computer Science Education in Digital Sources},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Contribution: This study presents the results of a systematic mapping on
   the classification and organization of open educational resources (OERs)
   focused on Computer Science Education (CSEd) in digital sources.
   Background: The number of open resources (e.g., images, videos, and
   websites) available on the Internet for the teaching of Computer Science
   has increased in recent years. As a consequence, several authors have
   proposed different ways of classifying them, which include lists of
   disciplines, classification algorithms, and semantic enrichment.
   However, such studies are dispersed and fragmented in the literature,
   making the current state-of-the-art unclear. Research Questions: 1) What
   digital sources have been used to classify OERs for CSEd? 2) What CSEd
   domains have been explored for the classification of OERs? and 3) What
   approaches have been adopted for the classification of OERs for CSEd?
   Methodology: Three search strategies were performed: 1) automatic search
   in the five major digital libraries of CSEd; 2) manual search in the
   major CSEd conferences and journals; and 3) snowballing on the
   references and citations. As a result, 22 relevant studies were
   selected. Findings: The main findings were systematization of the main
   OER sources for CSEd, identification of 64 CSEd domains covered by OERs
   organized in a taxonomy, the immaturity level of investigations and
   tools, and lack of mechanisms that organize OERs for CSEd.},

Title = {LAMMPS-a flexible simulation tool for particle-based materials modeling
   at the atomic, meso, and continuum scales},

Abstract = {Since the classical molecular dynamics simulator LAMMPS was released as
   an open source code in 2004, it has become a widely-used tool for
   particle-based modeling of materials at length scales ranging from
   atomic to mesoscale to continuum. Reasons for its popularity are that it
   provides a wide variety of particle interaction models for different
   materials, that it runs on any platform from a single CPU core to the
   largest supercomputers with accelerators, and that it gives users
   control over simulation details, either via the input script or by
   adding code for new interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, or
   other features needed for their models. As a result, hundreds of people
   have contributed new capabilities to LAMMPS and it has grown from fifty
   thousand lines of code in 2004 to a million lines today. In this paper
   several of the fundamental algorithms used in LAMMPS are described along
   with the design strategies which have made it flexible for both users
   and developers. We also highlight some capabilities recently added to
   the code which were enabled by this flexibility, including dynamic load
   balancing, on-the-fly visualization, magnetic spin dynamics models, and
   quantum-accuracy machine learning interatomic potentials. Program

   Nature of problem: Many science applications in physics, chemistry,
   materials science, and related fields require parallel, scalable, and
   efficient generation of long, stable classical particle dynamics
   trajectories. Within this common problem definition, there lies a great
   diversity of use cases, distinguished by different particle interaction
   models, external constraints, as well as timescales and lengthscales
   ranging from atomic to mesoscale to macroscopic. Solution method: The
   LAMMPS code uses parallel spatial decomposition, distributed neighbor
   lists, and parallel FFTs for long-range Coulombic interactions {[}1].
   The time integration algorithm is based on the Stormer-Verlet symplectic
   integrator {[}2], which provides better stability than higher-order
   non-symplectic methods. In addition, LAMMPS supports a wide range of
   interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, software interfaces,
   and pre- and post-processing features. Additional comments including
   restrictions and unusual features: This paper serves as the definitive
   reference for the LAMMPS code. References {[}1] S. Plimpton, Fast

Title = {Educational renewal of physician training in Australia and New Zealand:
   Multiple educational innovations in a complex environment},

Abstract = {Aim: The Royal Australasian College of Physicians is renewing its
   specialty training programs and shifting towards competency-based
   medical education. Our aim is to improve the quality and rigor of
   training and graduate outcomes, and promote high standards of physician
   practice to serve the health of patients, families, and communities in a
   changing healthcare environment.
   Methods: We are progressing holistic change and multiple educational
   innovations in a complex environment. Numerous stakeholders, a disparate
   training landscape and a largely volunteer supervisor workforce pose
   challenges in supporting effective implementation. This paper describes
   our progress and experience with three key components of our education
   renewal program: curricular renewal, a new selection process and faculty
   development. It offers reflections on the practical challenges, lessons
   learned and factors critical for success.
   Conclusions: Our experience highlights opportunities for training
   organizations to maximize their influence over workplace training
   experiences and outcomes by taking a systems approach to the design,
   delivery and evaluation of the components of education renewal. We found
   that design, development and delivery of our multiple educational
   innovations have benefited from co-design approaches, progressive and
   concurrent development, continual exploration of new strategies, and
   implementation as soon as viable with a commitment to iterative
   improvements over time.},

Title = {Using parent feedback: A qualitative study of residents' and
   physician-educators' perspectives},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES ON MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {33-39},

Abstract = {Introduction Patients and family members can contribute to resident
   assessment in competency-based medical education. However, few studies
   have examined the use of patient/family member feedback generated from
   questionnaire-based assessments. To implement appropriate assessment
   strategies and optimize feedback use, we need to understand how
   residents and physician-educators would use feedback from these
   stakeholders. This study aimed to understand how paediatric residents
   and physician-educators would use parent feedback generated from
   questionnaire-based assessments.
   Methods This study was conducted at a paediatric academic health science
   centre. We held dyadic interviews with six residents and six
   physician-educators. A three-step approach was used to analyze the data:
   data reduction, data display, and conclusions/verifications. We
   developed an initial coding scheme, conducted an in-depth review of the
   data and coded it, finalized our coding scheme, and identified
   categories.
   Results Participants described that they would use parent feedback to:
   (a) provide additional direct observations of residents' performances,
   (b) teach and coach residents, (c) assess residents' overall performance
   and progression, and (d) encourage resident self-assessment and
   behaviour change.
   Discussion Parents directly observe residents as they interact with them
   and their children and, therefore, can provide feedback on residents'
   performances. Residency programs should include parent feedback and
   promote and facilitate its use by residents and physician-educators.
   Conclusion This study provides an initial understanding of how
   paediatric residents and physician-educators would use parent feedback
   if they were to receive it. This information, combined with future
   research, can inform the development and implementation of parent
   feedback strategies in competency-based medical education.},

Title = {Enhancing existing medical school curricula with an innovative
   healthcare disparities curriculum},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 11},
Abstract = {Background Effective healthcare disparities curricula seek to train
   physicians who are well equipped to address the health needs of an
   increasingly diverse society. Current literature on healthcare
   disparities curricula and implementation focuses on courses created
   independent of existing educational materials. Our aim was to develop
   and implement a novel resource-conserving healthcare disparities
   curriculum to enhance existing medical school lectures without the need
   for additional lectures. Methods This non-randomized intervention was
   conducted at the University of California Los Angeles. The curriculum
   was offered to all first-year medical students in the class of 2021
   (n=188). With institutional approval, a new healthcare disparities
   curriculum was created based on the Society of General Internal
   Medicine's core learning objectives for effective healthcare disparities
   curricula (J General Internal Med 25:S160-163, 2010). Implementation of
   the curriculum made use of ``teachable moments{''} within existing
   medical school lectures. Teachable moments were broad lecture topics
   identified by the research team as suitable for introducing relevant
   healthcare disparities content. The new lecture-enhancing healthcare
   disparities curriculum was delivered with the related lecture via
   integrated PDF documents uploaded to an online learning management
   system. Students were encouraged to complete pre- and post- course
   assessments to examine changes in disparities knowledge and self-rated
   confidence in addressing disparities. Matched chi 2 tests were used for
   statistical analysis. Results Participating students (n=92) completed
   both pre- and post-course assessments and were retrospectively
   stratified, based on self-reported use of the new lecture enhancing
   curriculum, into the ``high utilizer{''} group (use of materials
   ``sometimes{''} or ``very often,{''} n=52) and the comparison ``low
   utilizer{''} group (use of the materials ``rarely{''} or ``very
   rarely,{''} n=40). Students who self-identified as underrepresented
   racial and ethnic minorities in medicine were more likely to utilize the
   material (41\% of the high utilizers vs. 17\% of the low utilizer group,
   p<.01). Post-course knowledge assessment scores and self-reported
   confidence in addressing healthcare disparities improved only in the
   high utilizer group. Conclusions Integrating new guideline based
   curricula content simultaneously into pre-existing lectures by
   identifying and harnessing teachable moments may be an effective and
   resource-conserving strategy for enhancing healthcare disparities
   education among first year medical students.},

Abstract = {Owning to electricity market deregulation, residential customers now
   enjoy the freedom to choose their preferred electricity retailers. This
   paper investigates the application of recommender system, a
   fast-developing technique in machine learning, into the task of
   recommending electricity plans for the individual residential customer.
   Based on a collaborative filtering strategy, an electricity plan
   recommender system (EPRS) is developed. By providing easily obtainable
   data of some household appliances, residential customers of the EPRS are
   recommended with predicted ratings of different plans, which can provide
   effective guidance to customers in the selection of suitable plans and
   proper tariffs. Different numerical tests are carried out to evaluate
   the performance of the EPRS. The EPRS outperforms other strategies in
   the accuracy of recommendation result and is verified to be a promising
   solution to electricity plan recommendation task.},

Abstract = {The emerging mobile services have imposed several new challenges on the
   radio access network (RAN), which stimulates its evolution from
   cloud-RAN to next-generation RAN (NG-RAN). In NG-RAN, baseband functions
   are redefined as the radio unit (RU), distributed unit (DU), and central
   unit (CU), which are, respectively, connected by optical
   front/mid/backhaul (X-Haul) networks. The DU-CU placement and lightpath
   provision need an elaborate strategy for allocating resources tailored
   to user requests. However, most existing methods fail to fully perceive
   network conditions and then make inappropriate solutions, which may
   result in over-consumption of processing and transmission resources.
   Therefore, we propose a reinforcement-learning-based DU-CU placement and
   lightpath provision strategy using an edge-enhanced graph neural
   network, i.e, EGNN-RL. The EGNN is leveraged to adequately exploit
   graph-structured features in X-Haul networks, while
   proximal-policy-optimization-based RL is introduced to maintain policy
   stability. In addition, this problem is formulated as an integer linear
   programming model to find the optimal solution. We validate the proposed
   strategy under different service types (i.e., enhanced mobile broadband,
   ultra-reliable low latency communication, and massive machine
   connections) and different numbers of services, respectively. The
   results show that our scheme can achieve higher resource efficiency
   compared with existing methods. Moreover, it also adapts to new networks
   with the same nodes through fine-tuning the model. This can decrease
   nearly 15\% of the retaining time and obtain similar performance with
   retaining.},

Title = {Does faculty development influence the quality of in-training evaluation
   reports in pharmacy?},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {NOV 21},
Abstract = {Background: In-training evaluation reports (ITERs) of student
   workplace-based learning are completed by clinical supervisors across
   various health disciplines. However, outside of medicine, the quality of
   submitted workplace-based assessments is largely uninvestigated. This
   study assessed the quality of ITERs in pharmacy and whether clinical
   supervisors could be trained to complete higher quality reports.
   Methods: A random sample of ITERs submitted in a pharmacy program during
   2013-2014 was evaluated. These ITERs served as a historical control
   (control group 1) for comparison with ITERs submitted in 2015-2016 by
   clinical supervisors who participated in an interactive faculty
   development workshop (intervention group) and those who did not (control
   group 2). Two trained independent raters scored the ITERs using a
   previously validated nine-item scale assessing report quality, the
   Completed Clinical Evaluation Report Rating (CCERR). The scoring scale
   for each item is anchored at 1 ({''}not at all{''}) and 5
   ({''}exemplary{''}), with 3 categorized as ``acceptable{''}.
   Results: Mean CCERR score for reports completed after the workshop (22.9
   +/- 3.39) did not significantly improve when compared to prospective
   control group 2 (22.7 +/- 3.63, p = 0.84) and were worse than historical
   control group 1 (37.9 +/- 8.21, p = 0.001). Mean item scores for
   individual CCERR items were below acceptable thresholds for 5 of the 9
   domains in control group 1, including supervisor documented evidence of
   specific examples to clearly explain weaknesses and concrete
   recommendations for student improvement. Mean item scores for individual
   CCERR items were below acceptable thresholds for 6 and 7 of the 9
   domains in control group 2 and the intervention group, respectively.
   Conclusions: This study is the first using CCERR to evaluate ITER
   quality outside of medicine. Findings demonstrate low baseline CCERR
   scores in a pharmacy program not demonstrably changed by a faculty
   development workshop, but strategies are identified to augment future
   rater training.},

Title = {Data Mining Algorithm for Cloud Network Information Based on Artificial
   Intelligence Decision Mechanism},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {53394-53407},
Abstract = {Due to the rapid development of information technology and network
   technology, there is a lot of data, but the phenomenon of lack of
   knowledge is becoming more and more serious. Data mining technology has
   developed vigorously in this environment, and it has shown more and more
   vitality. Based on Spark programming model, this paper designs the
   parallel extension of fuzzy c-means. In order to enhance the performance
   of fuzzy c-means parallel expansion, the improvement strategy of k-means
   during the initialization phase is borrowed, and k-means// is extended
   to fuzzy c-means to obtain better clustering performance. Combined with
   Spark \& x2019;s programming model, this paper can obtain extended
   parallel fuzzy c-means algorithm. Several experiments on the data set of
   the algorithm proposed in this paper have shown good scalability and
   parallelism, effectively expanding fuzzy c-means clustering to
   distributed applications, greatly increasing the scale of the data
   processed by the algorithm. This improves the robustness of the
   algorithm and the adaptability of the algorithm to the shape and
   structure of the data, so that the parallel and scalable clustering
   algorithm can more effectively perform cluster analysis on big data.
   Three algorithms were simulated on MATLAB platform. We use simple data
   sets and complex two-dimensional data sets, and compare with the
   traditional fuzzy c-means algorithm and fuzzy c-means algorithm based on
   fuzzy entropy. Experiments show that the scalable parallel fuzzy c-means
   algorithm not only greatly improves the anti-noise performance, but also
   improves the convergence speed, and it can automatically determine the
   optimal number of clusters.},

Abstract = {Background: Identifying the predictors of nursing students' clinical
   competency in objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) is of
   utmost importance. Therefore, the present study was to investigate the
   predictive roles of exam anxiety and academic success in nursing
   students' clinical competency in the pre-internship OSCE.
   Methods: In this descriptive-analytical study, a total number of 102
   nursing students, meeting the inclusion criteria and enrolled in the
   sixth semester (third year) of the graduate nursing program in Iran,
   were firstly selected by the census method. The pre-internship OSCE was
   then implemented at eight stations based on a pre designed schedule
   template. The required data were also collected through a
   demographic-academic characteristics questionnaire and the State-Trait
   Anxiety Inventory to determine the exam anxiety score, the nursing
   program grade point average (GPA) to reflect on the levels of academic
   success, and the OSCE score to control clinical competency. The data
   analysis was also performed at the significance level of 0.05.
   Results: The linear regression model, in which the exam anxiety, the
   nursing program GPA, and the demographic academic characteristics
   variables had been imported, could explain 33.52\% of the variance of
   the nursing students' clinical competency in the pre-internship OSCE (R2
   = 0.616). Of the variables concerned, only the nursing program GPA could
   be a significant predictor of the nursing students' clinical competency
   scores in the OSCE, so that 0.8 points were added to the clinical
   competency scores in the OSCE as the nursing program GPA increased by
   one unit (p = 0.000, beta = 0.717), but no significant relationship was
   observed between exam anxiety and clinical competency in the
   pre-internship OSCE among the nursing students.
   Conclusions: The results of this study endorsed the use of the OSCE in
   assessing the nursing students' clinical competency and implementing
   learning strategies to strengthen the levels of academic success in such
   individuals.},

Title = {Nursing students' involvement in shift-to-shift handovers: Findings from
   a national study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {75},
Pages = {13-21},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: Effective performance of clinical handovers should be one of
   the priorities of nursing education to promote efficient communication
   skills and ensure patient safety. However, to date, no studies have
   explored to what extent nursing students are involved in handovers.
   Objective: To explore nursing students' handover involvement during
   their clinical rotations and associated factors.
   Method: This was a secondary analysis of a large national
   cross-sectional study that involved 9607 undergraduate nursing students
   in 27 universities across 95 three-year Italian baccalaureate nursing
   programs. The involvement in the clinical handovers was the end point
   (from 0, never, to 3, always). A path analysis was performed to identify
   variables directly and indirectly affecting students' handover
   involvement.
   Results: Handover involvement was reported as `only a little', `to some
   extent', and `always' by 1739 (18.1\%), 2939 (30.6\%), and 4180 (43.5\%)
   students, respectively; only 749 (7.8\%) of students reported never
   being involved. At the path analysis explaining the 19.1\% of variance
   of nursing students' involvement, some variables emerged that directly
   increased the likelihood of being involved in handovers. These were
   being female (beta = 0.115, p < 0.001); having children (beta = 0.107, p
   = 0.011); being a 3rd -year student (beta = 0.142, p < 0.001) and being
   a 2nd -year student as compared to a 1st-year student (beta = 0.050, p =
   0.036); and having a longer clinical rotation (beta = 0.015, p < 0.001)
   in units with high `quality of the learning environment' (beta = 0.279,
   p < 0.001). Moreover, students who were supervised by the nurse teacher
   (beta = -0.279, p < 0.001), or by a nurse on a daily basis (beta =
   0.253, p = 0.004), or by the staff (beta = 0.190, p < 0.001) reported
   being less involved in handovers as compared to those students
   supervised by a clinical nurse. Variables with indirect effects also
   emerged (model of student's supervision adopted at the unit level, and
   number of previous clinical rotations attended by students). Moreover,
   handover involvement explained 11.5\% of students self-reported degree
   of competences learned during the clinical experience.
   Conclusions: Limiting students' opportunity to be involved in handover
   can prevent the development of communication skills and the professional
   socialization processes. Strategies at different levels are needed to
   promote handover among undergraduate nursing students.},

Title = {Faculty Development for Medical School Community-Based Faculty: A
   Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance Study
   Exploring Institutional Requirements and Challenges},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {92},

Abstract = {Purpose
   Community-based faculty play a large role in training medical students
   nationwide and require faculty development. The authors hypothesized
   that positive relationships exist between clerkships paying preceptors
   and requiring faculty development, and between protected clerkship
   directors' time and delivering face-to-face preceptor training, as well
   as with the number or length of community-based preceptor visits.
   Through under-standing the quantity, delivery methods, barriers, and
   institutional support for faculty development provided to communitybased
   preceptors teaching in family medicine clerkships, best practices can be
   developed.
   Method
   Data from the 2015 Council of Academic Family Medicine's Educational
   Research Alliance survey of Family Medicine Clerkship Directors were
   analyzed. The cross-sectional survey of clerkship directors is
   distributed annually to institutional representatives of U.S. and
   Canadian accredited medical schools. Survey questions focused on the
   requirements, delivery methods, barriers, and institutional support
   available for providing faculty development to community-based
   preceptors.
   Results
   Paying community-based preceptors was positively correlated with
   requiring faculty development in family medicine clerkships. The
   greatest barrier to providing faculty development was community-based
   preceptor time availability; however, face-to-face methods remain the
   most common delivery strategy. Many family medicine clerkship directors
   perform informal or no needs assessment in developing faculty
   development topics for community-based faculty.
   Conclusions
   Providing payment to community preceptors may allow schools to enhance
   faculty development program activities and effectiveness. Medical
   schools could benefit from constructing a formal curriculum for faculty
   development, including formal preceptor needs assessment and program
   evaluation. Clerkship directors may consider recruiting and retaining
   community-based faculty by employing innovative faculty development
   delivery methods.},

Title = {Blue Skies With Clouds: Envisioning the Future Ideal State and
   Identifying Ongoing Tensions in the UME-GME Transition},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The transition from medical school to residency in the United States
   consumes large amounts of time for students and educators in
   undergraduate and graduate medical education (UME, GME), and it is
   costly for both students and institutions. Attempts to improve the
   residency application and Match processes have been insufficient to
   counteract the very large number of applications to programs. To address
   these challenges, the Coalition for Physician Accountability charged the
   Undergraduate Medical Education to Graduate Medical Education Review
   Committee (UGRC) with crafting recommendations to improve the system for
   the UME-GME transition. To guide this work, the UGRC defined and sought
   stakeholder input on a ``blue-skies{''} ideal state of this transition.
   The ideal state views the transition as a system to support a continuum
   of professional development and learning, thus serving learners,
   educators, and the public, and engendering trust among them. It also
   supports the well-being of learners and educators, promotes diversity,
   and minimizes bias. This manuscript uses polarity thinking to analyze 3
   persistent key tensions in the system that require ongoing management.
   First, the formative purpose of assessment for learning and growth is at
   odds with the use of assessment data for ranking and sorting candidates.
   Second, the function of residents as learners can conflict with their
   role as workers contributing service to health care systems. Third, the
   current residency Match process can position the desire for individual
   choice-among students and their programs-against the workforce needs of
   the profession and the public. This Scholarly Perspective presents
   strategies to balance the upsides and downsides inherent to these
   tensions. By articulating the ideal state of the UME-GME transition and
   anticipating tensions, educators and educational organizations can be
   better positioned to implement UGRC recommendations to improve the
   transition system.},

Title = {A Novel Method for Detecting Future Generations of Targeted and
   Metamorphic Malware Based on Genetic Algorithm},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {69951-69970},
Abstract = {This paper presents a novel solution for detecting rare and mutating
   malware programs and provides a strategy to address the scarcity of
   datasets for modeling these types of malware. To provide sufficient
   training data for malware behavioral modeling, genetic algorithms are
   used together with an optimization strategy that selectively creates
   generations of mutated elite malware samples. In our unique method, a
   sequence of system API calls is extracted using tracker filter drivers
   in a sandbox environment. The most obfuscated and metamorphic malware
   are chosen by an elite selection method. The behavioral chromosomes are
   formed by mapping extracted APIs to genes using linear regression. Our
   analysis system includes an Internet simulator and a human emulator to
   deceive intelligent classes of malware to successfully execute
   themselves and prevent system halting. The evolution process is
   performed through crossover and permutation of genes, which are encoded
   based on the addresses of the kernel-level system functions. An
   objective function has been defined to optimize the vital indicators of
   malignancy and tracking rate with a linear time complexity. This
   guarantees that new generations of malware are more destructive and
   stealthy than their parents. J48 and deep neural networks were employed
   in our experiments as they are two popular modeling and classification
   strategies in the area of behavioral malware detection. Real-world
   malware samples from valid references were used for the performance
   evaluation of our approach. Comprehensive scenarios were involved in the
   experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed strategy. The
   results demonstrate significant improvement in detection accuracy - up
   to 5\% considering rare and metamorphic malware. The results also
   demonstrated a considerable enhancement in true positive rate for the
   proposed deep-learning algorithm.},

Abstract = {Based on in-depth qualitative interviews with student veterans in the
   United States pursuing Bachelor's degrees in engineering across four
   institutions, we present findings relating military leadership and its
   application to engineering education. Our findings address three themes:
   (1) how leadership skills are learned, (2) motivation to be a leader,
   and (3) translation into, and enactment of military leadership skills
   in, engineering education. The interviews show that leadership skills
   and experiences acquired in the military play an important role in the
   academic experiences and success of student veterans in engineering
   (SVEs). Findings can help inform strategies and programs to encourage
   more SVEs to translate their leadership skills to an academic setting in
   an asset-based framework. Providing leadership opportunities for SVEs in
   the classroom has the potential to increase their engagement in
   engineering, strengthen their pathways to professional engineering
   practice, and provide important role models of servant leadership for
   the other engineering undergraduates who work with them.},

Title = {Development and Validation of a Novel Measure for the Direct Assessment
   of Empathy in Veterinary Students},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Empathy is a requisite clinical skill for health professionals and
   empathy scores have been positively associated with professionalism,
   clinical competency, confidence, well-being, and emotional intelligence.
   In order to improve empathy in the veterinary field, it is critical to
   measure the construct of empathy accurately. Most research has relied on
   self-reporting measures to assess empathy, while some studies have
   recently implemented the use of simulated client encounters in
   veterinary education. Building on this research, the aim of the current
   study was to develop and validate a novel quantitative assessment
   tool-the Empathy Clinical Evaluation Exercise (ECEX)-designed to measure
   empathy based on directly observable behaviors, using simulated clients.
   To evaluate empathy, evaluators used the ECEX to assess the performance
   of student clinicians in a simulated client encounter, which contained a
   pre-determined number of opportunities designed to elicit empathic
   responses from student clinicians. Statistical analysis suggests the
   test has a high degree of inter-rater reliability. In addition, there
   was moderate correlation between average empathy scores using ECEX and
   previously validated measures of empathy, compassion satisfaction, and
   burnout. Using these methods, we found the majority of students we
   studied had increased empathy scores at the completion of their primary
   care rotations. These results provide preliminary support for the use of
   the ECEX as a direct and quantitative tool for the assessment of
   empathy. Health professionals could use this novel empathy assessment
   tool to teach students, evaluate teaching strategies, and improve
   communication competencies in a wide variety of clinical settings. Our
   broad aim was to examine the utility of a direct and quantitative
   assessment tool for measuring empathy-the ECEX-in order to answer the
   following questions: (I) Does the tool have good inter-rater
   reliability? (2) Does the tool correlate with previously validated
   empathy measures? and (3) Does the tool correlate with similar
   constructs of compassion fatigue and burnout? Our secondary aim was to
   evaluate the change in empathy scores over the course of a 4-month
   (16-week) primary care rotation (pre- to -post).},

Title = {Predicting the Regional Adoption of Electric Vehicle (EV) With
   Comprehensive Models},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {147275-147285},
Abstract = {Adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has been regarded as one of the most
   important strategies to address the issues of energy dependence and
   greenhouse effect. Empirical reviews demonstrate that wide acceptance of
   EV is still difficult to achieve. This research proposes to investigate
   the factors that might trigger the wide usage of EVs to support the
   energy policy. The real-world owners of EV were extracted from the 2017
   National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), which provides large-scale
   individual characteristics. NHTS dataset was processed to establish the
   comprehensive estimation model for EV adoption with considering vehicle,
   personal and household factors. Besides the commonly social-economic
   factors, the gasoline price and car sharing program were found to be
   significant for EV adoption. Additionally, since the EV owners are only
   1.29\% of all vehicle owners, this article introduced the imbalanced
   dataset technique, which was seldom considered in existing researches.
   Subsequently, several machine learning methods were utilized to build
   the prediction model, and the model performance analysis indicates the
   Decision Tree (DT) model outperforms other models. A regional EV
   penetration map was also generated for the U.S. to validate the proposed
   approach. Implications for further research, transport policy and EV
   market are discussed.},

Abstract = {Physical education teacher education is at a ``tipping point{''} in
   history, where the survivability of the profession in many institutions
   of higher education may be in question. This monograph reflects an
   initial attempt to understand recruitment and retention in physical
   education teacher education programs from the perspective of program
   coordinators. The purpose of this culminating chapter is to connect key
   points identified throughout the monograph and critically assess how the
   results add to the knowledge base in physical education teacher
   education. The chapter authors present a historical perspective on
   reduced enrollments and identified strategies for the promotion of
   student recruitment and retention. It will become evident that if a
   favorable future for physical education is to become reality, then a
   vision must be developed and enacted through the concentrated efforts of
   multiple stakeholders who have the time and commitment necessary to
   enact positive change at local, state, and national levels.},

Title = {Computing eye gaze metrics for the automatic assessment of radiographer
   performance during X-ray image interpretation},

Abstract = {Aim: To investigate image interpretation performance by diagnostic
   radiography students, diagnostic radiographers and reporting
   radiographers by computing eye gaze metrics using eye tracking
   technology.
   Methods: Three groups of participants were studied during their
   interpretation of 8 digital radiographic images including the axial and
   appendicular skeleton, and chest (prevalence of normal images was
   12.5\%). A total of 464 image interpretations were collected.
   Participants consisted of 21 radiography students, 19 qualified
   radiographers and 18 qualified reporting radiographers who were further
   qualified to report on the musculoskeletal (MSK) system.
   Outcome measures: Eye tracking data was collected using the Tobii X60
   eye tracker and subsequently eye gaze metrics were computed. Voice
   recordings, confidence levels and diagnoses provided a clear
   demonstration of the image interpretation and the cognitive processes
   undertaken by each participant. A questionnaire afforded the
   participants an opportunity to offer information on their experience in
   image interpretation and their opinion on the eye tracking technology.
   Results: Reporting radiographers demonstrated a 15\% greater accuracy
   rate (p <= 0.001), were more confident (p < 0.001) and took a mean of
   2.4s longer to clinically decide on all features compared to students.
   Reporting radiographers also had a 15\% greater accuracy rate (p <=
   0.001), were more confident (p <= 0.001) and took longer to clinically
   decide on an image diagnosis (p = 0.02) than radiographers. Reporting
   radiographers had a greater mean fixation duration (p = 0.01), mean
   fixation count (p = 0.04) and mean visit count (p = 0.04) within the
   areas of pathology compared to students. Eye tracking patterns,
   presented within heat maps, were a good reflection of group expertise
   and search strategies. Eye gaze metrics such as time to first fixate,
   fixation count, fixation duration and visit count within the areas of
   pathology were indicative of the radiographer's competency.
   Conclusion: The accuracy and confidence of each group could be reflected
   in the variability of their eye tracking heat maps. Participants'
   thoughts and decisions were quantified using the eye tracking data. Eye
   tracking metrics also reflected the different search strategies that
   each group of participants adopted during their image interpretations.
   This is the first study to use eye tracking technology to assess image
   interpretation skills between various groups of different levels of
   experience in radiography, especially on a combination of the MSK
   system, chest cavity and a variety of pathologies. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Title = {Uplink-Downlink Duality Between Multiple-Access and Broadcast Channels
   With Compressing Relays},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Uplink-downlink duality refers to the fact that under a sum-power
   constraint, the capacity regions of a Gaussian multiple-access channel
   and a Gaussian broadcast channel with Hermitian transposed channel
   matrices are identical. This paper generalizes this result to a
   cooperative cellular network, in which remote access-points are deployed
   as relays in serving the users under the coordination of a central
   processor (CP). In this model, the users and the relays are connected
   over noisy wireless links, while the relays and the CP are connected
   over noiseless but rate-limited fronthaul links. Based on a Lagrangian
   technique, this paper establishes a duality relationship between such a
   multiple-access relay channel and broadcast relay channel, under the
   assumption that the relays use compression-based strategies.
   Specifically, we show that under the same total transmit power
   constraint and individual fronthaul rate constraints, the achievable
   rate regions of the Gaussian multiple-access and broadcast relay
   channels are identical, when either independent compression or Wyner-Ziv
   and multivariate compression strategies are used. The key observations
   are that if the beamforming vectors at the relays are fixed, the
   sum-power minimization problems under the achievable rate and fronthaul
   constraints in both the uplink and the downlink can be transformed into
   either a linear programming or a semidefinite programming problem
   depending on the compression technique, and that the uplink and downlink
   problems are Lagrangian duals of each other. Moreover, the dual
   variables corresponding to the downlink rate constraints become the
   uplink powers; the dual variables corresponding to the downlink
   fronthaul constraints become the uplink quantization noises. This
   duality relationship enables an efficient algorithm for optimizing the
   downlink transmission and relaying strategies based on the uplink.},

Abstract = {Modern neurological rehabilitation medicine and its clinical research
   results show that through the scientific rehabilitation training, the
   damaged limb motor function can be restored to some extent. During the
   entire rehabilitation process, the physician needs to monitor and
   evaluate the patient's physical condition and training effect in real
   time in order to develop or adjust the follow-up rehabilitation training
   program. Therefore, this paper takes the sports rehabilitation training
   as the background and based on the Internet of Things technology to
   develop a sports rehabilitation monitoring system based on wearable
   sensors and Internet of Things technology. Through the development of
   the sensory sensor monitoring sensor terminal node, based on the needs
   of physiological parameter monitoring during the rehabilitation training
   process, a monitoring system including electrocardiogram (ECG) signals,
   electromyography (EMG) signals, motion posture, body temperature and
   other physiological parameters was constructed based on the Internet of
   Things technology. The experimental results show that the system
   constructed in this paper can closely monitor the changes of vital signs
   of target users while providing real-time monitoring, and provide
   feedback. These physiological data can be analyzed to help doctors
   formulate effective rehabilitation training programs. Evaluate the
   recovery of exercise capacity and training participation, so as to
   achieve the purpose of improving training efficiency and achieving
   rehabilitation effects},

Title = {Real-time data-driven dynamic scheduling for flexible job shop with
   insufficient transportation resources using hybrid deep Q network},

Abstract = {With the extensive application of automated guided vehicles in
   manufacturing system, production scheduling considering limited
   transportation resources becomes a difficult problem. At the same time,
   the real manufacturing system is prone to various disturbance events,
   which increase the complexity and uncertainty of shop floor. To this
   end, this paper addresses the dynamic flexible job shop scheduling
   problem with insufficient transportation resources (DFJSP-ITR) to
   minimize the makespan and total energy consumption. As a sequential
   decision-making problem, DFJSP-ITR can be modeled as a Markov decision
   process where the agent should determine the scheduling object and
   allocation of resources at each decision point. So this paper adopts
   deep reinforcement learning to solve DFJSP-ITR. In this paper, the
   multiobjective optimization model of DFJSP-ITR is established. Then, in
   order to make agent learn to choose the appropriate rule based on the
   production state at each decision point, a hybrid deep Q network (HDQN)
   is developed for this problem, which combines deep Q network with three
   extensions. Moreover, the shop floor state model is established at
   first, and then the decision point, generic state features,
   genetic-programming-based action space and reward function are designed.
   Based on these contents, the training method using HDQN and the strategy
   for facing new job insertions and machine breakdowns are proposed.
   Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted, and the results show
   that HDQN has superiority and generality compared with current
   optimization-based approaches, and can effectively deal with disturbance
   events and unseen situations through learning.},

Title = {By the assemblage: physical education teachers' encounters of a state

Abstract = {With a focus on the American context, the study investigates a teacher
   accountability reform as an expanding assemblage of neoliberal
   governance by providing an account of physical education teachers who
   were experiencing an accountability reform that required them to
   document student learning growth for teacher evaluation. Through
   stratified sampling, 51 teachers were sampled from elementary, middle
   and high schools in North Carolina that served socioeconomically diverse
   communities for an online survey and a semi-structured indepth interview
   on their experiences with the accountability system and their
   envisioning of the future system. Reductive analysis yielded three
   themes. First, to prevent their program from being expendable, teachers
   subjected themselves to the accountability system by identifying with
   assessment and evaluation knowledge and adopting self-disciplinary
   practices. Second, they recognized the partiality, irrationality and
   discontinuity of various assessment as it reduced complex physical
   education learning through questionable quantification processes. Third,
   teachers experienced profound inequality in the accountability system,
   as the system applied different governance technologies towards the
   tested and non-tested subjects. Situated in theories of power (Foucault,
   1982), assemblage (Deleuze \& Guattari, 1988) and graduated governance
   (Ong, 2006), the study conceptualizes the teacher accountability system
   as an expanding assemblage of neoliberal governance. It attempted to
   include physical education under its governance but exacerbated the
   existing inequality across tested and non-test subjects. The results of
   the study suggest scholars and teachers in physical education to seek
   creative strategies to quantify student learning, having the values of
   the subject recognized in and beyond the accountability system.},

Abstract = {The state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) structures
   present growing irregularity in the sense of layer connections, which
   derives from the innovative manual designs and the recently proposed
   neural architecture searching approaches. Such irregular structures
   improve recognition accuracy, but also bring challenges for hardware
   deployment, especially on CNN accelerators with regular architectures:
   1) the complicated data dependency makes it nontrivial to decide the
   data reuse strategy between layers and 2) since the execution order of
   each network is not unique, the choice of layer scheduling, memory
   allocating, and loop tiling strategies greatly impact the hardware
   performance. These challenges cannot be solved by the existing CNN
   schedulers, which mainly focuses on the dataflow of a single layer. In
   this work, we propose a comprehensive framework to analyze and solve the
   mapping of an arbitrarily connected CNN network to specific hardware
   accelerators. We propose: 1) a dynamic programming and
   nodeclustering-based DAG partitioning approach to efficiently exploit
   interlayer data reuse and 2) a subgraph scheduling and onchip memory
   allocating strategy to find the optimal execution order. With the
   modeling of CNN accelerators, we also propose a loop tiling approach for
   fused layers. An automated framework is established to generate binary
   machine codes from original CNN models produced by mainstream deep
   learning frameworks, which can process large-scale CNNs with more than
   1000 layers in only a few minutes. Experiments based on stateof-the-art
   accelerators (e.g., NVDLA) show that our techniques greatly reduce the
   external data transfer of interlayer dependencies and bring significant
   performance improvement over existing approaches.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to assist educators in developing their skills
   in both modeling and numerical simulation of a Computational Fluid
   Dynamics (CFD) problem and fluid structure interaction under ABAQUS.
   This new teaching strategy serves as a background tool for educators to
   use in Masters programs in materials engineering. We present a case
   study of numerical simulation of a water jet impacting a new
   aeronautical material Ti555-03 titanium steel plate. The CFD behavior of
   the jet is investigated using a FV (Finite volume) method. The
   Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) is studied using a coupled SPH
   (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics)-FE (Finite Element) method. The jet
   hits the metal sheet with an initial velocity 500 m/s. Two
   configurations which differ from each other by the position (angle of
   inclination) of the plate relative to the axis of revolution of the jet
   inlet are investigated. Our objective is to predict the impact of the
   fluid produced at high pressure and high speed - especially at the first
   moment of impact. Numerical simulations are carried out under ABAQUS. We
   show that the inclination of the titanium alloy plate by 45 degrees
   stimulates the phenomenon of recirculation of water. This affects the
   velocity profile, turbulence and boundary layers in the impact zone. The
   stagnation zone and the phenomenon of water recirculation are strongly
   influenced by the slope of the plate which gives a pressure gradient and
   displacement - very important between the two configurations.
   Fluctuations of physical variables (displacement and pressure) prove the
   need for a noise and vibratory study. These predictions will
   subsequently be used for the modeling of the problem of an orthogonal
   cut in a high-speed machining process assisted by high-pressure water
   jet.},

Title = {Optimal management of bio-based energy supply chains under parametric
   uncertainty through a data-driven decision-support framework},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {139},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper addresses the optimal management of a multi-objective
   bio-based energy supply chain network subjected to multiple sources of
   uncertainty. The complexity to obtain an optimal solution using
   traditional uncertainty management methods dramatically increases with
   the number of uncertain factors considered. Such a complexity produces
   that, if tractable, the problem is solved after a large computational
   effort. Therefore, in this work a data-driven decision-making framework
   is proposed to address this issue. Such a framework exploits machine
   learning techniques to efficiently approximate the optimal management
   decisions considering a set of uncertain parameters that continuously
   influence the process behavior as an input. A design of computer
   experiments technique is used in order to combine these parameters and
   produce a matrix of representative information. These data are used to
   optimize the deterministic multi-objective bio-based energy network
   problem through conventional optimization methods, leading to a detailed
   (but elementary) map of the optimal management decisions based on the
   uncertain parameters. Afterwards, the detailed data-driven relations are
   described/identified using an Ordinary Kriging meta-model. The result
   exhibits a very high accuracy of the parametric meta-models for
   predicting the optimal decision variables in comparison with the
   traditional stochastic approach. Besides, and more importantly, a
   dramatic reduction of the computational effort required to obtain these
   optimal values in response to the change of the uncertain parameters is
   achieved. Thus the use of the proposed data-driven decision tool
   promotes a time-effective optimal decision making, which represents a
   step forward to use data-driven strategy in large-scale/complex
   industrial problems.},

Abstract = {Manufacturing enterprises nowadays face huge environmental challenges
   because of energy consumption and associated environmental impacts. One
   of the effective strategies to reduce energy consumption is by employing
   intelligent scheduling techniques. Production scheduling can have
   significant impact on energy saving in manufacturing system from the
   operation management point of view. Resource flexibility and complex
   constraints in flexible manufacturing system make production scheduling
   a complicated nonlinear programming problem. To this end, a

Abstract = {As the core technology of the next generation mobile communication
   system, the development of 5G key technologies needs to be able to
   efficiently and effectively support massive data services. Aiming at the
   impact of massive data traffic on mobile communication networks in 5G
   communication systems, this paper proposes a 5G-oriented hierarchical
   distributed cloud service mobile communication system architecture. The
   model consists of a cloud access layer, a distributed micro-cloud
   system, and a core cloud data center. The distributed micro cloud system
   consists of multiple micro clouds that are deployed to the edge of the
   network. The service content in the core cloud data center can be
   deployed and cached to the local micro cloud server in advance to reduce
   repeated redundant transmission of user requested content in the
   network. Aiming at the problem of how to determine the migration object
   when dynamically optimizing the resource structure, a heuristic
   function-based dynamic optimization algorithm for cloud resources is
   proposed. The experimental results show that the dynamic expansion
   algorithm of cloud resources based on dynamic programming ideas can
   better improve the performance of virtual resources, and the dynamic
   optimization algorithm of cloud resources based on heuristic functions
   can effectively and quickly optimize the resource structure, thereby
   improving the operating efficiency of user virtual machine groups. An
   efficient resource allocation scheme based on cooperative Q (Quality)
   learning is proposed. The environmental knowledge obtained by the base
   station learning and exchanging information is used for distributed
   resource block allocation. This resource allocation scheme can obtain
   the optimal resource allocation strategy in a short learning time, and
   can terminate the learning process at any time according to the delay
   requirements of different services. Compared with traditional resource
   allocation schemes, it can effectively improve system throughput.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the grant-free random access mechanism for
   massive Internet of Things (IoT) devices. By embedding the data symbols
   in the signature sequences, joint device activity detection and data
   decoding can be achieved, which, however, significantly increases the
   computational complexity. Coordinate descent algorithms that enjoy a low
   per-iteration complexity have been employed to solve this detection
   problem, but previous works typically employ a random coordinate
   selection policy which leads to slow convergence. In this article, we
   develop multiarmed bandit (MAB) approaches for more efficient detection
   via coordinate descent, which achieves a delicate tradeoff between
   exploration and exploitation in coordinate selection. Specifically, we
   first propose a bandit-based strategy, i.e., Bernoulli sampling, to
   speed up the convergence rate of coordinate descent, by learning which
   coordinates will result in more aggressive descent of the nonconvex
   objective function. To further improve the convergence rate, an inner
   MAB problem is established to learn the exploration policy of Bernoulli
   sampling. Both convergence rate analysis and simulation results are
   provided to show that the proposed bandit-based algorithms enjoy faster
   convergence rates with a lower time complexity compared with the
   state-of-the-art algorithm. Furthermore, our proposed algorithms are
   generally applicable to different scenarios, e.g., massive random access
   with low-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).},

Abstract = {This paper presents an algorithmic strategy to nonstationary policy
   search for finite-horizon, discrete-time Markovian decision problems
   with large state spaces, constrained action sets, and a risk-sensitive
   optimality criterion. The methodology relies on modeling time-variant
   policy parameters by a nonparametric response surface model for an
   indirect parametrized policy motivated by Bellman's equation. The policy
   structure is heuristic when the optimization of the risk-sensitive
   criterion does not admit a dynamic programming reformulation. Through
   the interpolating approximation, the level of nonstationarity of the
   policy, and consequently, the size of the resulting search problem can
   be adjusted. The computational tractability and the generality of the
   approach follow from a nested parallel implementation of derivative-free
   optimization in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulation. We demonstrate
   the efficiency of the approach on an optimal energy storage charging
   problem, and illustrate the effect of the risk functional on the
   improvement achieved by allowing a higher complexity in time variation
   for the policy.},

Title = {Exploring opportunities for embedding graduate attributes in a
   first-year undergraduate anatomy course for allied health students},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Volume = {19},

Abstract = {Background There is a growing discontent within the health care industry
   regarding the state of preparedness of graduates to adequately function
   in a dynamic work environment. It is therefore required of higher
   education institutions to equip graduates with skills beyond
   disciplinary expertise, which would allow them to function optimally in
   work environments. This study presents a team dissection project that
   incorporates graduate attributes in an undergraduate first-year anatomy
   course for the medical orthotics and prosthetics program. Method Focus
   group interviews with students (n = 23) were used to demonstrate the
   achievement of graduate attributes by aligning student perceptions of
   the dissection project with graduate attributes and indicators thereof.
   Results Students were positive about the effectiveness of the dissection
   project in enforcing anatomical knowledge; ensuring active engagement
   with human material; enhancing communication skills and teamwork; and
   increasing sensitivity towards cultural diversity. These views related
   largely to those graduate attributes which engage students towards
   becoming active and reflective learners; creative thinkers; independent
   and collaborative workers; effective communicators; and culturally and
   socially aware citizens. Areas of dissatisfaction included challenges
   with the use of technology for the video preparation; repetition of
   presentations and large dissection teams. Conclusion There is an
   emerging view that graduate attributes be integrated as early as
   possible into program curricula so as to become intrinsic in a student's
   academic and professional development. Through the expansion of a
   dissection project forming part of a subject taught very early on in a
   program's curriculum, the integration of graduate attributes and
   discipline-specific competencies are highlighted.},

Title = {Forecast-Assisted Service Function Chain Dynamic Deployment for
   SDN/NFV-Enabled Cloud Management Systems},
Journal = {IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 14},
Abstract = {Software-defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV)
   are acknowledged as the most promising technologies to effectively
   allocate resource for network service. A service function chain (SFC),
   which can deploy virtualized network functions (VNFs) and chain them
   with associated flows allocation, can be used to represent each network
   service owing to the introduction of the SDN/NFV technology. Co-hosted
   applications on multiple Internet of Things terminals have dynamic and
   time-varying service requirements, in order to allocate network
   resources optimally and meet the end-to-end delay requirements of
   services, sufficient strategies are required to satisfy the continuously
   changing service demands. In this article, a deep learning model that
   combines the multitask regression layer above the graph neural networks
   is first presented to predict the future resource requirements of each
   VNF instance. The SFC deployment problem is then solved using the
   integer nonlinear programming (INLP) approach, and a novel
   prediction-assisted Viterbi algorithm is presented to overcome the
   scalability problem of the INLP approach. According to the simulation
   findings, the proposed deep model provides a minimum of a 6.2\%
   improvement in prediction accuracy over baseline prediction models, and
   the proposed SFC deployment strategy has been demonstrated to deliver
   better performance in terms of acceptance ratio and revenue, compared to
   the current passive deployment algorithms.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Movement integration (MI) is a method to increase physical
   activity with numerous learning outcomes. However, MI implementation is
   low. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a
   job-embedded professional development intervention on teachers' MI
   barriers. An implementation science approach was used. Methods: The
   intervention was developed and delivered through six procedures.
   Mixed-methods data were used to develop the intervention and assess
   outcomes. The intervention was delivered over 3 weeks to 12
   participants. Results: Reported barriers included time constraints, lack
   of space, fear of losing control, and limited confidence and competence.
   Results indicated a significant increase in teachers' self-reported MI
   use from pre- to postimplementation (Z = -2.138, p =.0165, r =.6),
   improved confidence (p =.048), and a strong positive correlation (tau(b)
   =.627, p =.018) between confidence and competence. Conclusion:
   Job-embedded professional development may be an effective strategy to
   support teachers in overcoming barriers to MI.},

Title = {A Markov decision process for response-adaptive randomization in
   clinical trials},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS \& DATA ANALYSIS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {178},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In clinical trials, response-adaptive randomization (RAR) has the
   appealing ability to assign more subjects to better-performing
   treatments based on interim results. Traditional RAR strategies alter
   the randomization ratio on a patient-by-patient basis. An alternate
   approach is blocked RAR, which groups patients together in blocks and
   recomputes the randomization ratio in a block-wise fashion; past works
   show that this provides robustness against time-trend bias. However,
   blocked RAR poses additional questions: how many blocks should there be,
   and how many patients should each block contain? TRIALMDP is an
   algorithm that designs two-armed blocked RAR clinical trials. It differs
   from other trial design approaches in that it optimizes the size and
   number of blocks in addition to their treatment allocations. More
   precisely, the algorithm yields an adaptive policy that chooses the size
   and allocation ratio of the next block, based on results seen up to that
   point in the trial. TRIALMDP is related to past works that compute
   optimal trial designs via dynamic programming. The algorithm maximizes a
   utility function balancing (i) statistical power, (ii) patient outcomes,
   and (iii) the number of blocks. It attains significant improvements in
   utility over a suite of baseline designs, and gives useful control over
   the tradeoff between statistical power and patient outcomes. It is well
   suited for small trials that assign high cost to patient failures.(c)

   Records-A comparative case study between two hospitals},

Abstract = {Background/Purpose Despite widespread use of Electronic Health Records
   (EHR), the promise of benefits has not been clearly realised due, in
   part, to inadequate physician training. Training for EHR use is a highly
   complex intervention that occurs in a dynamic socio-technical health
   system. The purpose of this study was to describe and critically assess
   the interplay between educational activities and organisational factors
   that influenced EHR training and implementation across two different
   hospitals. Methods Based in a socio-technical framework, a comparative
   qualitative case study was undertaken as well suited to real-world
   processes. Semi-structured interviews were completed (n = 43),
   representing administrative leaders, staff physicians, residents and EHR
   trainers from two Canadian academic hospitals. Thematic analysis was
   employed for analysis. Results Similar findings were noted at both
   hospitals despite different implementation strategies. Despite mandatory
   training, physicians described limited transferability of training to
   the workplace. Factors contributing to this included standardised vendor
   modules (lacking specificity for their clinical context); variable EHR
   trainer expertise; limited post-launch training; and insufficient
   preparation for changes to workflow. They described learning while
   caring for patients and using workarounds. Strong emotional responses
   were described, including anger, frustration, anxiety and fear of
   harming patients. Conclusions Training physicians for effective EHR
   utilisation requires organisational culture transformation as EHRs
   impacts all aspects of clinical workflows. Analytic thinking to consider
   workflows, ongoing post-launch training and the recognition of the
   interdependency of multiple factors are critical to preparing physicians
   to provide effective clinical care, and potentially reducing burnout. A
   list of key considerations is provided for educational leaders.},

Abstract = {Despite advances in active learning pedagogy and other methods designed
   to increase student engagement in the chemistry classroom, retention and
   engagement issues still persist, particularly with respect to women and
   minorities underrepresented in STEM (science, technology, engineering,
   and mathematics) programs. Relevancy also remains elusive in the
   chemistry classroom, where real-world issues of social justice, health,
   and the environment are largely missing from chemistry curricula. As a
   result, students struggle to understand their role as change agents and
   global citizens with leadership responsibility toward developing
   solutions to these justice issues, particularly as they relate to
   chemistry and manufacturing industries. Green chemistry curriculum
   developed by groups such as the Molecular Design Research Network,
   Beyond Benign, Greener Education Materials for Chemists, and others is
   available for faculty to seamlessly integrate topics of social, health,
   and environmental justice problem-solving into their classes, with a
   focus on educating future chemists who recognize their role in solving
   (or preventing) global justice issues. The purpose of this paper is to
   share new instructional strategies needed to add relevancy to the life
   of chemistry students.},

Abstract = {Transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various
   domains of applications and gradually becomes the foundations of the
   advanced large deep learning (DL) models. However, how to train these
   models over multiple GPUs efficiently is still challenging due to a
   large number of parallelism choices. Existing DL systems either rely on
   manual efforts to make distributed training plans or apply parallelism
   combinations within a very limited search space. In this approach, we
   propose Galvatron, a new system framework that incorporates multiple
   popular parallelism dimensions and automatically finds the most
   efficient hybrid parallelism strategy. To better explore such a rarely
   huge search space, we 1) involve a decision tree to make decomposition
   and pruning based on some reasonable intuitions, and then 2) design a
   dynamic programming search algorithm to generate the optimal plan.
   Evaluations on four representative Transformer workloads show that
   Galvatron could perform automatically distributed training with
   different GPU memory budgets. Among all evaluated scenarios, Galvatron
   always achieves superior system throughput compared to previous work
   with limited parallelism.},

Title = {An exploration of an interprofessional embedded educational model
   between occupational therapy and industrial design: a qualitative
   hermeneutical phenomenological inquiry},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 15},
Abstract = {Background Interprofessional education represents an opportunity for
   healthcare and design students to deepen their understanding of users
   and enhance skill development through collaborative experiences.
   Embedding these collaborative experiences within entire curricula moves
   the notion of experiential learning from stand-alone projects towards
   the nuanced learning opportunities only available with sustained regular
   contact. Methods Occupational therapy doctoral students were integrated
   into two cohorts of Master of Industrial Design (MSID) student courses
   for one academic year. Interviews were conducted to gather qualitative
   information about the student experiences, which were then transcribed,
   coded, and analyzed for themes.Results Industrial design students
   reported positive learning experiences when collaborating with
   occupational therapy students that deepened understanding of
   user-centeredness, improved communication skills, and more
   well-developed student projects than would have been possible alone.
   Conclusion The contribution of occupational therapy and industrial
   design students into collaborative courses and projects may result in a
   greater topical understanding and more advanced skill development than
   any singular discipline's program. Further research to compare
   development against students without collaborative experiences is needed
   to understand the magnitude of a collaboration's potential impact.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Volume = {8},
Pages = {213981-213997},
Abstract = {Constrained optimization problems (COPs) are common in many fields, and
   the search algorithm and constraint handling technique play important
   roles in the constrained evolution algorithms. In this article, we
   propose a new optimization algorithm named CETDE based on ensemble
   differential evolution (DE) and a two-level epsilon-constrained method.
   In the ensemble DE variant, some promising parameters and mutation
   strategies constitute the candidate pool, and each element in the pool
   coexists throughout the search process and competes to generate new
   solutions. The two-level epsilon method is proposed by incorporating a
   generation and a population comparison level to retain more promising
   solutions without degrading the solution quality. Moreover, a diversity
   promotion scheme is developed to improve the population distribution
   when the search becomes trapped in a small region. The superior
   performance of CETDE is validated by comparison with some
   state-of-the-art COEAs over two sets of artificial benchmarks and five
   real-world problems. The competitive results show that CETDE is an
   effective method for solving COPs.},

Title = {Parenthood and Medical Training: Challenges and Experiences of Physician
   Moms in the US},
Journal = {TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 31},
Abstract = {Phenomenon: Balancing the demands of medical training and parenthood is
   challenging. We explored perceptions of programmatic support, parental
   leave, breastfeeding, and self-reported biggest challenges among a large
   cohort of physician mothers in a variety of medical specialties and
   across the stage of training when they had their first child. Our goal
   was to inform strategies to help improve the physician parent
   experience. Approach: This cross-sectional, observational survey study
   was performed using a convenience sample from an online physician-mom
   support group from January to February 2018. Descriptive statistics and
   bivariate analyses were used to report results and examine relationships
   between career stage at first child and outcome variables. Responses to
   the open-ended question, ``What is your biggest challenge as a physician
   mom?{''} were qualitatively analyzed. Findings: The survey received 896
   complete responses. The most common specialties were obstetrics and
   gynecology (25.3\%), pediatrics (19.9\%), internal medicine or
   medicine/pediatrics (17.1\%), and family medicine (10.2\%). The majority
   of participants (63.9\%) had their first child during medical training,
   including medical school (14.3\%), residency (35.8\%) or fellowship
   (13.6\%). Medical students were less likely to perceive programmatic
   support than residents or fellows (44.1\% vs. 63.1\% vs. 62.3\%,
   respectively), and only 19.9\% of participants who became parents during
   medical training reported having a clear and adequate parental leave
   policy. Nearly 70\% of participants breastfed for six months or more,
   with no statistical differences across career stage. Most participants
   (57.6\%) delayed child-bearing for one or more reasons, with 32.3\%
   delaying to complete training. The most common codes applied to
   responses for `biggest challenges as a physician mom' were insufficient
   time, lack of work-life balance, missing out, and over-expectation.
   Insights: Physician mothers, particularly those who had their first
   child during training, continue to struggle with support from training
   programs, finding work-life balance, and feelings of inadequacy.
   Interventions such as clear and adequate leave policies,
   program-sponsored or onsite childcare and improved programmatic support
   of breastfeeding and pumping may help to ameliorate the challenges
   described by our participants.},

Title = {A novel perspective on multiclass classification: Regular simplex
   support vector machine},
Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {480},
Pages = {324-338},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Although support vector machine (SVM) and its variants have been
   combined successfully with partitioning strategies for multiclass
   classification, a series of individual classifiers have to be considered
   separately, which significantly limits the sparseness of the solution.
   In this work, from an absolutely novel perspective, we proposed a
   regular simplex support vector machine (RSSVM) for the K-class
   classification. RSSVM maps the K classes to K vertices of a (K -
   1)-dimensional regular simplex so that the K-class classification
   becomes a (K - 1)-output learning task. We measured the training loss by
   comparing the square distances between the output point of each sample
   and the vertices. As a result, we were able to implement RSSVM by
   constructing a single primal problem with linear inequality constraints,
   endowing it with excellent sparseness. This method, however, made the
   computational complexity of RSSVM higher than commonly used K-class
   classification methods. To overcome this drawback, we added an
   appropriate regularized term to the primal problem, making the dual
   problem a quadratic programming problem, and we developed an exclusive
   sequential minimization optimization-type solver to accelerate our
   ability to solve it. Numerical experiments indicated that our proposed
   RSSVM not only demonstrated excellent sparseness but also superior
   overall accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {Private and public policies are increasingly aimed at supporting efforts
   to broaden participation of a diverse body of students in higher
   education. Unfortunately, this increase in student diversity does not
   always occur alongside changes in institutional culture. Unexamined
   biases in institutional culture can prevent diverse students from
   thriving and persisting in science, technology, engineering, and
   mathematics (STEM) fields. Given the daily personal interactions that
   faculty have with students, we suggest that individual educators have
   the opportunity, and responsibility, to improve the retention and
   persistence of diverse students. However, in our experience, faculty
   professional development programs often limit discussions of diversity
   to ``comfortable{''} topics (such as learning styles) and miss
   opportunities to explore deeper issues related to faculty privilege,
   implicit bias, and cues for stereotype threat that we all bring to the
   classroom. In this essay, we present a set of social science concepts
   that we can extend to our STEM courses to inform our efforts at
   inclusive excellence. We have recommended strategies for meaningful
   reflection and professional development with respect to diversity and
   inclusion, and aim to empower faculty to be change agents in their
   classrooms as a means to broadening participation in STEM fields.},

Abstract = {The fifth-generation of wireless communication (5G) is a promising
   paradigm toward massive interconnectivity within Internet-of-Things
   (IoT) networks. However, because the data traffic throughput sharply
   increases with the number of IoT devices, a tremendous burden on the
   backhaul links and core networks results. With this in mind, mobile edge
   caching is an effective method that can relieve stress of the backhaul
   links, while decreasing the service latency. The purpose of this study
   is to analyze the problem of jointly optimizing cooperative edge caching
   and radio resource allocation in 5G-enabled massive IoT networks. For
   that, a joint optimization long-term nonlinear integer programming
   problem is posed. This class of problems is known to be NP-hard; thus,
   to reduce the problem complexity, a divide and conquer scheme will be
   applied-the task at hand will be divided into two subproblems: 1)
   cooperative edge caching and 2) radio resource allocation. The
   cooperative edge caching subproblem is formulated as a constrained
   Markov decision process. Herein, a deep reinforcement learning method to
   optimize the caching decisions for all the edge nodes. Then, based on
   the resulting optimal caching decisions, the radio resource allocation
   subproblem for each edge node is posed as an NLIP problem, and an
   improved branch-and-bound method is proposed to yield the optimal radio
   resource allocation decisions for each edge node. Extensive simulations
   were performed to confirm that the proposed methods have the capability
   of enhancing the content caching hit ratio, while lessening the content
   retrieving delays for 5G-enabled massive IoT networks-improving over
   various baseline algorithms.},

Abstract = {This paper describes and assesses the impact of a new upper-level
   ``scholarly{''} laboratory model that is part of a four-year scaffolded
   research skills curriculum at a Carnegie Bachelor's institution. In this
   scholarly lab model, students gain the ``tools{''} of a discipline in a
   first-semester laboratory and engage in the scholarly work of the
   instructor in the second semester. Analogous to the experience of
   graduate students in a research rotation program, undergraduates
   participating in these scholarship-based laboratories in addition to
   their capstone research requirement are exposed to chemical research in
   multiple subdisciplines as well as different scholarly strategies to
   conduct research. Student perception data show that scholarly lab
   students feel highly engaged in all steps of the scientific method and
   that they integrate, implement, and improve the research skills gained
   throughout the four-year research skill curriculum. Authentic,
   student-driven collaborations within and between courses were observed
   multiple times in the two pilot iterations. However, the model was less
   effective than anticipated at building student confidence and sense of
   inclusion in the scientific community. Participation in the scholarly
   based laboratory model led to a statistically significant similar to
   10\% improvement in lab notebook, final presentation, overall lab, and
   overall course grades for the scholarly lab cohort compared to a
   traditional lab cohort in a second-semester physical chemistry course.
   College-assigned women and men benefit similarly from the scholarly lab
   model, though these groups show some important perception differences
   that are discussed.},

Abstract = {Accurate traffic speed forecasting is one of the most critical tasks in
   proactive traffic management and the deployment of advanced traveler
   information systems. This paper proposes a hybrid forecasting approach
   named DeepEnsemble by integrating the three-dimensional convolutional
   neural network (3D CNN) with ensemble empirical mode decomposition
   (EEMD). There are four steps in this hybrid approach. First, EEMD is
   adopted to decompose the complex traffic speed time series data with
   noise into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residue.
   Second, a three-dimensional tensor is established and fed into 3D CNN
   for prediction. Third, the output of 3D CNN prediction is obtained by a
   linear combination of the results of all components. Finally, the 3D CNN
   prediction output, external features, and historical features are fused
   to predict the network-wide traffic speed simultaneously. The proposed
   DeepEnsemble approach is tested on the three-month traffic speed series
   data of a real-world large-scale urban expressway network with 308
   traffic flow detectors in Beijing, China. The experimental results
   indicate that DeepEnsemble outperforms the state-of-the-art network-wide
   traffic speed forecasting models. 3D CNN learns temporal, spatial, and
   depth information better than 2D CNN. Moreover, forecasting accuracy can
   be improved by employing EEMD. DeepEnsemble is a promising model with
   scalability and portability for network-wide traffic speed prediction
   and can be further extended to conduct traffic status monitoring and
   congestion mitigation strategies.},

Title = {OntoPhaco: An Ontology for Virtual Reality Training in Ophthalmology
   Domain-A Case Study of Cataract Surgery},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {152347-152378},
Abstract = {Performing a safe and successful cataract surgery greatly depends on the
   effective training programs of the residents that are commonly offered
   by several public and private healthcare providers. Virtual Reality
   Training (VRT) as a training tool for example, expresses potential
   capabilities to improve the learning curve, increasing trainee
   confidence and acquisition of skills. However, the success of this tool
   highly depends on how close this tool is to the reality. Ontology is
   called as a significant modelling tool which can help to provide a
   shared and common understanding of a domain, and in this scenario, a
   standardized terminology for representing the training domain, and
   actions taking place in Virtual Environment (VE). Recent Systematic
   Literature Review (SLR) findings show that most ontology designs for VRT
   are not built systematically and there is no ontology describing the
   domain knowledge for VRT in the ophthalmology field. There is also a
   lack of a high achievement rate in implementing ontology driven VRT,
   calls for systematic and comprehensive steps. Therefore, in order to
   lower the failure rate of ontology applied to VRT, OntoPhaco was
   designed and developed based on philosophically grounded foundational
   ontologies, namely, Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) and Design \&
   Engineering Methodology for Organizations (DEMO). The evaluation results
   showed that the use of OntoPhaco was able to improve the student's
   learning experience, assist effectively in building VR training
   scenarios, and lead to a successful VRT processes. The lessons learnt
   from designing OntoPhaco for this domain could generally generate
   valuable contribution to the theory and practice of VRT, knowledge
   management and ontology engineering in complex domains.},

Abstract = {Inference-based optimization via simulation, which substitutes Gaussian
   process (GP) learning for the structural properties exploited in
   mathematical programming, is a powerful paradigm that has been shown to
   be remarkably effective in problems of modest feasible-region size and
   decision-variable dimension. The limitation to ``modest{''} problems is
   a result of the computational overhead and numerical challenges
   encountered in computing the GP conditional (posterior) distribution on
   each iteration. In this paper, we substantially expand the size of
   discrete-decision-variable optimization-via-simulation problems that can
   be attacked in this way by exploiting a particular GP-discrete Gaussian
   Markov random fields-and carefully tailored computational methods. The
   result is the rapid Gaussian Markov Improvement Algorithm (rGMIA), an
   algorithm that delivers both a global convergence guarantee and
   finite-sample optimality-gap inference for significantly larger
   problems. Between infrequent evaluations of the global conditional
   distribution, rGMIA applies the full power of GP learning to rapidly
   search smaller sets of promising feasible solutions that need not be
   spatially close. We carefully document the computational savings via
   complexity analysis and an extensive empirical study.
   Summary of Contribution: The broad topic of the paper is optimization
   via simulation, which means optimizing some performance measure of a
   system that may only be estimated by executing a stochastic,
   discrete-event simulation. Stochastic simulation is a core topic and
   method of operations research. The focus of this paper is on
   significantly speeding-up the computations underlying an existing method
   that is based on Gaussian process learning, where the underlying
   Gaussian process is a discrete Gaussian Markov Random Field. This
   speed-up is accomplished by employing smart computational linear
   algebra, state-of-the-art algorithms, and a careful divide-and-conquer
   evaluation strategy. Problems of significantly greater size than any
   other existing algorithm with similar guarantees can solve are solved as
   illustrations.},

Abstract = {Objective: accurately classifying the malignancy of lesions detected in
   a screening scan is critical for reducing false positives. Radiomics
   holds great potential to differentiate malignant from benign tumors by
   extracting and analyzing a large number of quantitative image features.
   Since not all radiomic features contribute to an effective classifying
   model, selecting an optimal feature subset is critical. Methods: this
   work proposes a new multi-objective based feature selection (MO-FS)
   algorithm that considers sensitivity and specificity simultaneously as
   the objective functions during feature selection. For MO-FS, we
   developed a modified entropy-based termination criterion that stops the
   algorithm automatically rather than relying on a preset number of
   generations. We also designed a solution selection methodology for
   multi-objective learning that uses the evidential reasoning approach
   (SMOLER) to automatically select the optimal solution from the
   Pareto-optimal set. Furthermore, we developed an adaptive mutation
   operation to generate the mutation probability in MO-FS automatically.
   Results: we evaluated the MO-FS for classifying lung nodule malignancy
   in low-dose CT and breast lesion malignancy in digital breast
   tomosynthesis. Conclusion: the experimental results demonstrated that
   the feature set selected by MO-FS achieved better classification
   performance than features selected by other commonly used methods.
   Significance: the proposed method is general and more effective radiomic
   feature selection strategy.},

Title = {Development and initial validation of an online engagement metric using
   virtual patients},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {SEP 17},
Abstract = {Background: Considerable evidence in the learning sciences demonstrates
   the importance of engagement in online learning environments. The
   purpose of this work was to demonstrate feasibility and to develop and
   collect initial validity evidence for a computer-generated dynamic
   engagement score based on student interactions in an online learning
   environment, in this case virtual patients used for clinical education.
   Methods: The study involved third-year medical students using virtual
   patient cases as a standard component of their educational program at
   more than 125 accredited US and Canadian medical schools. The engagement
   metric algorithm included four equally weighted components of student
   interactions with the virtual patient. We developed a self-report
   measure of motivational, emotional, and cognitive engagement and
   conducted confirmatory factor analysis to assess the validity of the
   survey responses. We gathered additional validity evidence through
   educator reviews, factor analysis of the metric, and correlations
   between student use of the engagement metric and self-report measures of
   learner engagement.
   Results: Confirmatory factor analysis substantiated the hypothesized
   four-factor structure of the survey scales. Educator reviews
   demonstrated a high level of agreement with content and scoring
   cut-points (mean Pearson correlation 0.98; mean intra-class correlation
   0.98). Confirmatory factor analysis yielded an acceptable fit to a
   one-factor model of the engagement score components. Correlations of the
   engagement score with self-report measures were statistically
   significant and in the predicted directions.
   Conclusions: We present initial validity evidence for a dynamic online
   engagement metric based on student interactions in a virtual patient
   case. We discuss potential uses of such an engagement metric including
   better understanding of student interactions with online learning,
   improving engagement through instructional design and interpretation of
   learning analytics output.},

Title = {Deviations from venous blood specimen collection guideline adherence
   among senior nursing students},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {34},

Pages = {237-242},

Abstract = {Background: Despite considerable efforts to increase patient safety by
   supporting the use of best practice medical and nursing guidelines by
   healthcare staff, adherence is often suboptimal. Swedish nurses often
   deviate from venous blood specimen collection (VBSC) guideline
   adherence. We assessed the adherence to national VBSC guidelines among
   senior nursing students.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, self-reported questionnaire
   survey among 101 out of 177 senior nursing students consisting of
   web-based students in their fifth semester and campus-based students in
   their fifth or sixth semester out of six. In regard to the VBSC
   procedures, we asked about adherence to the patient identification, test
   request handling, and test tube labelling protocols that the students
   had learned during their second semester and practiced thereafter.
   Results: Guideline adherence to patient identification was reported by
   81\%, test request handling by 74\%, and test tube labelling by 2\% of
   the students. Students with no prior healthcare education reported to a
   higher extent that they operated within the guidelines regarding
   labelling the test tube before entering the patient's room compared to
   students with prior healthcare education. Using multiple logistic
   regression analysis, we found that fifth semester web-based program
   students adhered better to VBSC guidelines regarding comparing patient
   ID/test request/tube label compared to campus-based students.
   Conclusions: Senior nursing students were found to adhere to VBSC
   guidelines to a similar extent as registered nurses and other hospital
   ward staff in clinical healthcare. Thus student adherence to VBSC
   guidelines had deteriorated since their basic training in the second
   semester, and this can impact patient safety during university/clinical
   studies. The results of our study have implications for nursing practice
   education. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Slardar: Scheduling information incomplete inter-datacenter
   deadline-aware coflows with a decentralized framework},
Journal = {COMPUTER NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {214},
Month = {SEP 4},
Abstract = {Nowadays, geographically distributed edge clusters and datacenters
   generate large volumes of wide-area network (WAN) traffic. Therefore, it
   is critical to schedule inter-datacenter flows, especially coflows that
   imply application-level semantics, to improve the performance of
   geo-distributed applications. However, coflows often have a mixture of
   soft and hard deadline requirements, which cannot be efficiently
   guaranteed by existing methods. In this paper, a decentralized
   deadline-ware coflow scheduling framework, called Slardar, is proposed.
   It schedules inter-datacenter coflows while considering both hard and
   soft deadline requirements. However, it is challenging to design such a
   framework without complete coflow information. Hence, we first model the
   intra-coflow bandwidth allocation problem as a mean-field game where
   each datacenter aims to minimize its own cost with only local coflow
   information. We further prove its mean-field equilibrium is also the
   optimal bandwidth allocation strategy and propose a deep reinforcement
   learning based algorithm to find an approximate optimal numerical
   solution. Then, we investigate the offline inter-coflow bandwidth
   allocation problem by modeling it as a linear programming problem, and
   an online greedy heuristic algorithm is proposed to find an approximate
   optimal solution. Finally, we compare Slardar with state-of-art methods
   by large-scale simulation experiments. Experimental results show that
   our proposed method can greatly improve the transmission revenue and
   increase the soft and hard deadline guarantee ratios by 7.5\% and 10\%
   at least.},

Title = {Optimal Placement and Intelligent Smoke Detection Algorithm for
   Wildfire-Monitoring Cameras},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {72326-72339},
Abstract = {Smoke produced by wildfires is usually visible much earlier than flames.
   Hence, early detection of wildfire smoke is essential to prevent severe
   property losses and heavy casualties from catastrophic wildfires. Camera
   networks are being built and expanded to achieve timely wildfire smoke
   detection. To achieve the best camera coverage and detection accuracy
   with limited budget, an intelligent video smoke detection algorithm and
   an optimal wildfire camera placement strategy are in a critical need. In
   this paper, we propose an efficient video smoke detection framework
   designed for embedded applications on local cameras. It consists of two
   modules. In the first module, the original video frames are processed by
   local binary patterns and a dense optical flow estimator. In the second
   module, the produced features are then fed into a lightweight deep
   convolutional neural network, which serves as a binary classifier to
   detect the presence of smoke. We also formulate the wildfire camera
   placement problem as a binary integer programming problem to minimize
   the overall fire risk of a given area. Case studies on real-world videos
   are carried out to validate the accuracy as well as the computational
   and memory efficiency of the proposed smoke detection framework. We also
   validate our proposed camera placement strategy by simulating the
   deployment of wildfire cameras across a test region in Southern
   California.},

Title = {On the security of ANN-based AC state estimation in smart grid},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {105},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {With the deployment of new elements in the smart grid, traditional state
   estimation methods are challenged by growing dynamics and system size.
   Artificial neural network (ANN) based AC state estimation has been shown
   to provide faster results than traditional methods. However, researchers
   have discovered that ANNs could be easily fooled by adversarial
   examples. In this paper, we initiate a new study of adversarial false
   data injection attacks against ANN-based state estimation. By injecting
   a deliberate attack vector into measurements, the attacker can degrade
   the accuracy of ANN state estimation while remaining undetected. We
   propose two algorithms to generate the attack vectors, a
   population-based algorithm (differential evolution or DE) and a
   gradient-based algorithm (sequential least square quadratic programming
   or SLSQP). The performance of these algorithms is evaluated through
   simulations on IEEE 9-bus, 14-bus, and 30-bus systems under various
   attack scenarios. Simulation results show that DE is more effective than
   SLSQP on all simulation cases. The attack examples generated by the DE
   algorithm successfully degrade the ANN state estimation accuracy with
   high probability (more than 80\% in all simulation cases), despite
   having a small number of compromised meters and low injection strength.
   We further discuss the potential defense strategy to mitigate such
   attacks, which provides insights for robustness improvement in future
   research.

Title = {Inference of m-NLP data using radial basis function regression with
   center-evolving algorithm},
Journal = {COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {280},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {An efficient technique is presented to infer space plasma density and
   satellite potentials from Langmuir probe measurements, using
   multivariate radial basis function (RBF) regression. This inference
   technique goes beyond analytic approaches which have been developed over
   nearly a century, and which remain in use in most lab and space plasma
   experiments. The method is assessed by applying it to synthetic data
   sets constructed with three-dimensional particle in cell (PIC)
   simulations of fixed-bias needle Langmuir probes proposed by Jacobsen,
   to determine a plasma parameter, independently of the temperature. Our
   approach follows machine learning techniques, whereby models are
   constructed on training data sets consisting of the simulated collected
   currents as a function of voltage, corresponding to known physical
   parameters such as plasma density and temperature, and satellite
   potential. Compared to standard approaches used in RBF regression, our
   approach proves to be particularly efficient when working with large
   training sets, by implementing an evolutive selection of optimal
   centers. Program summary Program title: CERBF CPC Library link to

   MIT Programming language: Fortran 90 Nature of problem: When
   constructing a radial basis function (RBF) regression inference model,
   the determination of the optimal set of centers in a given training data
   set can be very time consuming, owing to the large number of possible
   combinations of centers among entries in the set. The center evolving
   approach implemented in this program, greatly reduces the training time
   of a model, with minimal impact on model inference accuracy. Solution
   method: A new search strategy is implemented for finding an optimal set
   of centers used in radial basis function regression, which is
   particularly fast and efficient when working with large data sets.
   Instead of performing a single exhaustive search among all possible
   combinations of a given number of centers among a training set,
   successive exhaustive searches are made in randomly selected small
   subsets of the training sets, while carrying over optimal centers found
   in one search, to the next one. Using modest subsets, with a number of
   entries of order 20, RBF models can be constructed with inference
   accuracies close to ones obtained with more time consuming exhaustive
   searches. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Physical literacy is creating significant interest worldwide due to its
   holistic nature and the potential it has to impact on people's lives. It
   is underpinning many physical education programs, coaching strategies,
   health initiatives, and policymakers' decisions. However, the complex
   philosophical and holistic nature of the concept has meant that methods
   used to chart/assess/measure progress have been very much dependent on
   the pedagogues interpretation of the concept. This paper will provide a
   review of current practices and issues related to
   charting/assessing/measuring progress of an individual's journey. It
   will go on to highlight considerations that, we suggest, should be made
   by any organization developing methods to chart/assess/measure progress.},

Title = {Quantifying circular RNA expression from RNA-seq data using model-based

Abstract = {Motivation: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that
   are widely expressed in various cell lines and tissues of many
   organisms. Although the exact function of many circRNAs is largely
   unknown, the cell type-and tissue-specific circRNA expression has
   implicated their crucial functions in many biological processes. Hence,
   the quantification of circRNA expression from high-throughput RNA-seq
   data is becoming important to ascertain. Although many model-based
   methods have been developed to quantify linear RNA expression from
   RNA-seq data, these methods are not applicable to circRNA
   quantification.
   Results: Here, we proposed a novel strategy that transforms circular
   transcripts to pseudo-linear transcripts and estimates the expression
   values of both circular and linear transcripts using an existing
   model-based algorithm, Sailfish. The new strategy can accurately
   estimate transcript expression of both linear and circular transcripts
   from RNA-seq data. Several factors, such as gene length, amount of
   expression and the ratio of circular to linear transcripts, had impacts
   on quantification performance of circular transcripts. In comparison to
   count-based tools, the new computational framework had superior
   performance in estimating the amount of circRNA expression from both
   simulated and real ribosomal RNA-depleted (rRNA-depleted) RNA-seq
   datasets. On the other hand, the consideration of circular transcripts
   in expression quantification from rRNA-depleted RNA-seq data showed
   substantial increased accuracy of linear transcript expression. Our
   proposed strategy was implemented in a program named Sailfish-cir.},

   nurses},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {117},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: With the rapidly aging population, the quality of
   end-of-life (EOL) care has become a significant issue. As the majority
   of deaths in Hong Kong (HK) currently occur in public hospitals,
   promoting palliative home care can relieve hospital burden and provide
   good deaths. There is a practical need to properly educate and train
   nurses on the skills to provide EOL care in home care settings.
   Objectives: To evaluate the effect of the first EOL care training
   program for nurses working in home care settings or nursing homes on
   quality of life at work, orientation toward dying and death, and
   self-competence in death work.
   Design: A pre-experimental research design was utilized to conduct this
   study using a one-group pretest and posttest approach.
   Settings and participants: A convenience sample of 153 nurses working in
   home care settings or nursing homes in HK was selected.
   Methods: Participating nurses attended two-day entry-level and seven-day
   advanced-level courses. Quality of life at work, multidimensional
   orientation toward dying and death, and self-competence in death work
   were assessed using questionnaires at baseline and immediately after
   entry- and advanced-level training.
   Results: The results revealed that nurses reported a higher level of
   compassion satisfaction (d = 2.52, p < 0.001), less burnout at work (d =
   3.25, p = 0.045), less fear about their own death (d = 1.33, p = 0.019),
   and more acceptance of others' deaths (d = 1.07, p = 0.004) in
   post-advanced-level courses. In general, participants were satisfied
   with the delivery method, duration, and logistical arrangement of the
   courses.
   Conclusions: Nurses reported improved professional quality of life, less
   fear, and more acceptance toward death and dying after the training
   program. More educational strategies, such as role-play and case study
   discussions, are needed to improve the overall learning experience and
   effectiveness of the program. Future studies could add a qualitative
   component to yield deeper insights through the findings. As training
   programs allow nurses to cultivate their skills in clinical situations,
   there is an undeniable need to continue implementing standardized
   education and training for palliative care nurses to improve EOL care
   quality.},

Abstract = {Public health measurement is important for government administration as
   it provides indicators and implications to public healthcare strategies.
   The measurement of health status has been traditionally conducted via
   surveys in the forms of pre-designed questionnaires to collect responses
   from targeted participants. Apart from benefits, traditional approach is
   costly, time-consuming, and not scalable. These limitations make a major
   obstacle to policy makers to develop up-to-date healthcare programs.
   This paper studies the use of health-related information conveyed in
   user-generated content from social media for prediction of health
   outcomes at population level. Specifically, we investigate linguistic
   features for analysing textual data. We propose the use of visual
   features learnt from deep neural networks for understanding visual data.
   We introduce collective social capital information from location-based
   social media data. We conducted extensive experiments on large-scale
   datasets collected from two online social networks: Foursquare and
   Flickr, against the task of prediction of the U.S. county health
   indices. Experimental results showed that visual and collective social
   capital data achieved comparable prediction performance and outperformed
   textual information. These promising results also suggest the potential
   of social media for health analysis at population scales.},

Abstract = {Logistics network optimization is an important part of the spare parts
   allocation problem. In recent years, reverse logistics has greatly
   increased the efficiency of the supply chain. However, it also increases
   the difficulty of mathematical modeling and solving. In order to solve
   the network optimization problem of spare parts, a multi-period
   closed-loop logistics network is established. The practical problem is
   described as a mixed nonlinear integer programming model with
   multi-objective and multi-constraint. An improved multi-objective ant
   lion algorithm is proposed to solve this model. In the proposed
   algorithm, Levy flight and the quasi-opposites-based learning strategy
   are used to improve the performance of the algorithm. The numerical
   simulation shows that the convergence and distribution of the result of
   the proposed algorithm are promoted. Finally, the mathematical model is
   solved by the proposed algorithm, and a sensitivity analysis is carried
   out. The results show that, first, the proposed closed-loop supply
   network is superior to the traditional forward logistics network.
   Second, the improved ant lion algorithm is more effective than a basic
   ant lion algorithm and other classical algorithms.},

Abstract = {In this letter, a novel framework to deliver critical spread out URLLC
   services deploying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in an out-of-coverage
   area is developed. To this end, the resource optimization problem, i.e.,
   resource blocks (RBs) and power allocation, and optimal UAV deployment
   strategy are studied for UAV-assisted 5G networks to jointly maximize
   the average sum-rate and minimize the transmit power of UAV while
   satisfying the URLLC requirements. To cope with the sporadic URLLC
   traffic problem, an efficient online URLLC traffic prediction model
   based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is proposed which derives
   optimal URLLC scheduling and transmit power strategy. The formulated
   problem is revealed as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP),
   which is solved following the introduced successive minimization
   algorithm. Finally, simulation results are provided to show our proposed
   solution approach's efficiency.},

Abstract = {In a level-5 autonomous driving system, the autonomous driving vehicles
   (AVs) are expected to sense the surroundings via analyzing a large
   amount of data captured by a variety of onboard sensors in
   near-real-time. As a result, enormous computing costs will be introduced
   to the AVs for processing the tasks with the deployed machine learning
   (ML) model, while the inference accuracy may not be guaranteed. In this
   context, the advent of edge intelligence (EI) and sixth-generation (6G)
   wireless networking are expected to pave the way to more reliable and
   safer autonomous driving by providing multi-access edge computing (MEC)
   together with ML to AVs in close proximity. To realize this goal, we
   propose a two-tier EI-empowered autonomous driving framework. In the
   autonomous-vehicles tier, the autonomous vehicles are deployed with the
   shallow layers by splitting the trained deep neural network model. In
   the edge-intelligence tier, an edge server is implemented with the
   remaining layers (also deep layers) and an appropriately trained
   multi-task learning (MTL) model. In particular, obtaining the optimal
   offloading strategy (including the binary offloading decision and the
   computational resources allocation) can be formulated as a mixed-integer
   nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which is solved via MTL in
   near-real-time with high accuracy. On another note, an edge-vehicle
   joint inference is proposed through neural network segmentation to
   achieve efficient online inference with data privacy-preserving and less
   communication delay. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed framework, and open research topics are finally listed.},

Journal = {CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS \& CONTINUA},

Volume = {73},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1463-1482},
Abstract = {The most resource-intensive and laborious part of debugging is finding
   the exact location of the fault from the more significant number of code
   snippets. Plenty of machine intelligence models has offered the
   effective localization of defects. Some models can precisely locate the
   faulty with more than 95\% accuracy, resulting in demand for trustworthy
   models in fault localization. Confidence and trustworthiness within
   machine intelligence-based software models can only be achieved via
   explainable artificial intelli-gence in Fault Localization (XFL). The
   current study presents a model for generating counterfactual
   interpretations for the fault localization model???s decisions. Neural
   system approximations and disseminated presentation of input information
   may be achieved by building a nonlinear neural network model. That
   demonstrates a high level of proficiency in transfer learning, even with
   minimal training data. The proposed XFL would make the decision-making
   transparent simultaneously without impacting the model???s perfor-mance.
   The proposed XFL ranks the software program statements based on the
   possible vulnerability score approximated from the training data. The
   model???s performance is further evaluated using various metrics like
   the number of assessed statements, confidence level of fault
   localization, and Top-N evaluation strategies.},

Title = {Improved Firefly Algorithm for the Optimal Coordination of Directional
   Overcurrent Relays},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {78503-78514},
Abstract = {In an electrical power network linear and non-linear models are used for
   directional overcurrent relay (DOCR) coordination issue by applying
   different heuristic techniques. Nature inspired algorithms (NIA) have
   found great interest in power system optimization issues. This paper
   proposes the recently developed meta-heuristic technique known as
   Firefly Algorithm (FA) that mimics the flashing behavior of fireflies.
   The implementation of the proposed algorithm has been utilized to solve
   the coordination of DOCR problems. The main aim of this paper is to find
   out the optimum values of the Time Dial Setting (TDS) to minimize the
   relay operating time. The modifications to original FA has been
   implemented in this paper to solve the DOCR coordination issues.
   Self-adaptive weight and experience-based learning strategy are added in
   the original FA, named as improved firefly algorithm (IFA). In IFA, a
   self-adaptive weight is presented to change the propensity of moving the
   best solution and ignoring the worst solution. In addition, an
   experience-based learning system is created and utilized arbitrarily to
   keep up the populace-assorted variety and improve the exploration
   capacity. The IFA has been tested on IEEE 6 and 30-bus systems and
   tested on IEEE 9-bus system for numerical DOCRs and the results had been
   compared with results of Whale optimization algorithm to validate the
   performance of IFA in case of numerical DOCR. The obtained results show
   that the IFA provides efficient and promising results compared to other
   meta-heuristic techniques mentioned in the literature. The IFA has been
   successfully implemented on MATLAB software programming.},

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be applied in many Internet of
   Things (IoT) systems, e.g., smart farms, as a data collection platform.
   However, the UAV-IoT wireless channels may be occasionally blocked by
   trees or high-rise buildings. An intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)
   can be applied to improve the wireless channel quality by smartly
   reflecting the signal via a large number of low-cost passive reflective
   elements. This article aims to minimize the energy consumption of the
   system by jointly optimizing the deployment and trajectory of the UAV.
   The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer-and-nonlinear programming
   (MINLP), which is challenging to address by the traditional solution,
   because the solution may easily fall into the local optimal. To address
   this issue, we propose a joint optimization framework of deployment and
   trajectory (JOLT), where an adaptive whale optimization algorithm (AWOA)
   is applied to optimize the deployment of the UAV, and an elastic ring
   self-organizing map (ERSOM) is introduced to optimize the trajectory of
   the UAV. Specifically, in AWOA, a variable-length population strategy is
   applied to find the optimal number of stop points, and a nonlinear
   parameter a and a partial mutation rule are introduced to balance the
   exploration and exploitation. In ERSOM, a competitive neural network is
   also introduced to learn the trajectory of the UAV by competitive
   learning, and a ring structure is presented to avoid the trajectory
   intersection. Extensive experiments are carried out to show the

Abstract = {This article introduces an open-source Java-based programming
   environment for creative coding of agglomerative systems using
   Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies. Our software originally focused
   on digital signal processing of audio-including synthesis, sampling,
   granular sample playback, and a suite of basic effects-but composers now
   use it to interface with sensors and peripherals through general-purpose
   input/output and external networked systems. This article examines and
   addresses the strategies required to integrate novel embedded musical
   interfaces and creative coding paradigms through an IoT infrastructure.
   These include: the use of advanced tooling features of a professional
   integrated development environment as a composition or performance
   interface rather than just as a compiler; techniques to create media
   works using features such as autodetection of sensors; seamless and
   serverless communication among devices on the network; and uploading,
   updating, and running of new compositions to the device without
   interruption.
   Furthermore, we examined the difficulties many novice programmers
   experience when learning to write code, and we developed strategies to
   address these difficulties without restricting the potential available
   in the coding environment. We also examined and developed methods to
   monitor and debug devices over the network, allowing artists and
   programmers to set and retrieve current variable values to or from these
   devices during the performance and composition stages. Finally, we
   describe three types of art work that demonstrate how the software,
   called HappyBrackets, is being used in live-coding and dance
   performances, in interactive sound installations, and as an advanced
   composition and performance tool for multimedia works.},

Abstract = {Purpose To elicit residents' perspectives on rewards and challenges of
   caring for ambulatory patients with chronic illness and ways to improve
   their education in caring for these patients.
   Method The authors conducted a qualitative study with internal medicine
   residents during ambulatory medicine block rotations at three academic
   health centers from October 2011 through February 2012. Focus group
   questions covered rewards and challenges of caring for patients with
   chronic illness and strengths and weaknesses of residency education
   therein, and the Chronic Care Model provided a framework for
   interpretation. Qualitative analysis was used to identify themes.
   Results Five focus groups were conducted with 28 residents. Discussions
   yielded 224 comments, which were categorized into 5 domains and 36
   themes. Twelve themes related to perceptions of challenges in providing
   care, and 3 themes related to perceptions of rewards in providing care.
   Eight themes focused on strategies to improve the patient experience.
   Strengths of the residency program were identified in 7 themes. Six
   themes related to ways for improving learning about caring for patients
   with chronic disease in the ambulatory setting.
   Conclusions Residents perceived rewards, challenges, and barriers in
   caring for patients with chronic illness in the ambulatory setting, from
   providers' and patients' perspectives. They have developed strategies to
   provide effective patient care. Residents identified best practices in
   their residency for resident education and patient care and also made
   suggestions for improvement. Findings have significant implications for
   residency education and practice redesign in the 21st century for care
   of patients with chronic illness.},

   Findings from an explorative European study},

Abstract = {Background: In the European context regulated by the Bologna Process
   principles, there is little evidence to date on the different profiles,
   if any, of nursing students enrolled in the 1st academic year and their
   academic outcomes.
   Aims: To describe and compare the nursing student profiles and their
   academic outcomes at the end of the 1st year across European Bachelor of
   Nursing Science (BNS) courses.
   Design: An exploratory multicentre cohort study involving five
   countries: Nursing students who were enrolled in nursing programmes for
   the academic year 2011/2012 in the participating BNS courses, willing to
   participate and regularly admitted to the 2nd academic year, were
   included in this study undertaken in 2013. Individual and faculty level
   variables were collected after having ensured the validity of the tools
   developed in English and then appropriately translated into the language
   of each participating country.
   Findings: A total of 378/710 (53.2\%) students participated in the
   study. They attended from 390 to 810 h of lessons, while clinical
   experience ranged from 162 to 536 h. The students reported a mean
   average age of 21.4 (Confidence of Interval {[}CI] 95\%, 21.0-22.3) and
   foreign students were limited in number (on average 3.7\%). The students
   reported adopting mainly individual learning strategies (92.9\%),
   duplicating notes or lecture notes prepared by professors (74.4\%), and
   concentrating their study before exams (74.6\%). The majority reported
   experiencing learning difficulties (49.7\%) and a lack of academic
   support (84.9\%). Around 332\% reported economic difficulties and the
   need to work while studying nursing on average for 24 h/week. Personal
   expectations regarding the nursing role were different (45.6\%) than the
   role encountered during the 1st year, as learning workloads were higher
   (57.2\%) with regard to expectations. Around one-third of students
   reported the intention to leave nursing education while the proportion
   of those reporting early academic failure was on average 5.6\%.
   Conclusions: More strategies aimed at harmonising nursing education
   across Europe, at supporting nursing students' learning processes during
   1st year, and identifying factors influencing their intention to leave
   and their academic failure, are recommended. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being utilized for a wide spectrum
   of applications in wireless networks leading to attractive business
   opportunities. In the case of abrupt disruption to existing cellular
   network operation or infrastructure, e.g., due to an unexpected surge in
   user demand or a natural disaster, UAVs can be deployed to provide
   instant recovery via temporary wireless coverage in designated areas. A
   major challenge is to determine efficiently how many UAVs are needed and
   where to position them in a relatively large 3D search space. We first
   consider a discrete set of possible UAV locations distributed in a given
   3D space and formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear program
   (MILP). Owing to the complexity of the MILP problem, we present an
   effective greedy approach that mimics the behavior of the MILP for small
   network scenarios and scales efficiently for large network scenarios.
   Afterwards, we propose and evaluate a more practical approach for
   multiple UAV deployment in a continuous 3D space, based on an
   unsupervised learning technique that relies on the notion of
   electrostatics with repulsion and attraction forces. We present
   performance results for the proposed algorithm as a function of various
   system parameters and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to the
   close-to-optimal greedy approach and its superiority compared to recent
   related work from the literature. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Data-driven strategies are gaining increased attention in protein
   engineering due to recent advances in access to large experimental
   databanks of proteins, next-generation sequencing (NGS), high-throughput
   screening (HTS) methods, and the development of artificial intelligence
   algorithms. However, the reliable prediction of beneficial amino acid
   substitutions, their combination, and the effect on functional
   properties remain the most significant challenges in protein
   engineering, which is applied to develop proteins and enzymes for
   biocatalysis, biomedicine, and life sciences. Here, we present a
   general-purpose framework (PyPEF: pythonic protein engineering
   framework) for performing data-driven protein engineering using machine
   learning methods combined with techniques from signal processing and
   statistical physics. PyPEF guides the identification and selection of
   beneficial proteins of a defined sequence space by systematically or
   randomly exploring the fitness of variants and by sampling random
   evolution pathways. The performance of PyPEF was evaluated concerning
   its predictive accuracy and throughput on four public protein and enzyme
   data sets using common regression models. It was proved that the program
   could efficiently predict the fitness of protein sequences for different
   target properties (predictive models with coefficient of determination
   values ranging from 0.58 to 0.92). By combining machine learning and
   protein evolution, PyPEF enabled the screening of proteins with various
   functions, reaching a screening capacity of more than 500,000 protein
   sequence variants in the timeframe of only a few minutes on a personal
   computer. PyPEF displayed significant accuracies on four public data
   sets (different proteins and properties) and underlined the potential of
   integrating data-driven technologies for covering different philosophies
   by either predicting the fitness of the variants to the highest accuracy
   accounting for epistatic effects or capturing the general trend of
   introduced mutations on the fitness in directed protein evolution
   campaigns. In essence, PyPEF can provide a powerful solution to current
   sequence exploration and combinatorial problems faced in protein
   engineering through exhaustive in silico screening of the sequence
   space.},

Abstract = {The need for better energy efficiency in grid computing is significant
   given the massive amount of energy dissipated by large grids. We
   approximate the optimal allocation of compute nodes to a job stream,
   with each job consisting of multiple tasks, and while considering both
   the computing requirements and a desired balance of shorter makespans
   and lower energy consumption. The approach is widely applicable to many
   grid scenarios and does not require the scheduler to have administrative
   rights to change the workers' DVFS or hibernation state. A discrete
   particle swarm optimisation (PSO) determines the worker assignments
   based on estimations of the tasks' service times and energy consumption
   using an online learning process, and taking into account pending task
   executions from prior jobs. The performance of the proposed system is

Title = {Expectations and requests regarding team training interventions to
   promote interdisciplinary collaboration in medical rehabilitation - A
   qualitative study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Month = {AUG 19},
Abstract = {Background: Interdisciplinary teamwork and team interventions are highly
   valued in the rehabilitation sector because they can improve outcomes of
   care for persons with complex health problems. However, little is known
   about expectations and requests regarding team interventions, especially
   in medical rehabilitation. This study aimed to explore how clinical
   managers and health professionals within multidisciplinary
   rehabilitation teams describe their expectations and requests regarding
   team-training interventions in the field of medical rehabilitation.
   Methods: Considering the methodology of qualitative research, data were
   collected using semi-structured interviews and focus groups at five
   rehabilitation clinics in Germany. We conducted face-to-face interviews
   with 5 clinical managers and 13 department heads of health care teams as
   well as five focus groups with a total of 35 members of
   interdisciplinary rehabilitation teams. Afterwards, the data were
   analyzed through qualitative content analysis encompassing data coding
   and using inductive thematic analysis.
   Results: The exploration of team members' and clinical managers'
   descriptions showed that, to them, interdisciplinary team training
   programs should include a wide array of training contents. Seven common
   core themes emerged from the interviews, including participation of
   employees, leadership, communication, team meetings, team composition,
   coordination, and equal esteem. Additionally, 13 themes were identified
   by either managers or team members. The body of expectations regarding
   team training content in healthcare spans the continuum of changes on
   the team and organizational levels. On the organizational level, a
   number of structural factors were mentioned (e.g. improving the general
   conditions for team meetings, organized workshops to exchange
   interdisciplinary experiences, and leadership training), and on the team
   level, changes in procedural factors were listed (e.g. optimizing the
   consecutive planning and coordination of patient treatments, clarity
   with regard to roles and responsibilities of team members, and mutual
   esteem and appreciation between different professions).
   Conclusions: The synthesis underscores that there is meaningful
   heterogeneity in team training needs; training interventions should be
   locally adapted for each clinic in terms of training content and
   training strategies. Tailored team interventions are important for
   rehabilitation clinics. Future work should evaluate employed team
   training concepts over time as well as training contents, implementation
   strategies, and learning outcomes. This includes using robust study
   designs and evaluating team-training effects.},

Title = {End-of-Life and Palliative Care Curricula in Internal Medicine
   Clerkships: A Report on the Presence, Value, and Design of Curricula as
   Rated by Clerkship Directors},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {89},

Abstract = {Purpose
   End-of-life and palliative care (EOL/PC) education is a necessary
   component of undergraduate medical education. The extent of EOL/PC
   education in internal medicine (IM) clerkships is unknown. The purpose
   of this national study was to investigate the presence of formal EOL/PC
   curricula within IM clerkships; the value placed by IM clerkship
   directors on this type of curricula; curricular design and
   implementation strategies; and related barriers and resources.
   Method
   The Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine conducted its annual survey
   of its institutional members in April 2012. The authors analyzed
   responses to survey items pertaining to formal EOL/PC curriculum and
   content using descriptive statistics. The authors used qualitative
   techniques to analyze free-text responses.
   Results
   The response rate was 77.0\% (94/122). Of those responding, 75.8\%
   (69/91) believed such training should occur in the IM clerkship, and
   43.6\% (41/94) reported formal curricula in EOL/PC. Multiple
   instructional modalities were used to deliver this content, with the
   majority of programs dedicating four or more hours to the curriculum.
   Curricula covered a wide range of topics, and student assessment tools
   were varied. Most felt that students valued this education. The
   qualitative analysis revealed differences in the values clerkship
   directors placed on teaching EOL/PC within the IM clerkship.
   Conclusions
   Although many IM clerkship directors have implemented formal curricula
   in EOL/PC, a substantial gap remains between those who have implemented
   and those who believe it belongs in the clerkship. Time, faculty, cost,
   and competing demands are the main barriers to implementation.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To qualitatively analyze videotaped data of surgical
   residents and fellows interacting with standardized patients to identify
   communication weaknesses. To correlate our qualitative data with their
   quantitative scores.
   DESIGN: We used discourse analysis to identify negative communication
   patterns among 10 surgical residents and fellows who were tested on
   interpersonal competencies during an objective structured clinical
   examination in 2014. We then correlated our findings with the validated
   evaluation outcomes. Descriptive statistics were then used to quantify
   our findings.
   SETTING: The setting was an objective structured clinical examination
   performed in 2014 using standardized patient surrogate family members.
   PARTICIPANTS: The participants were a mix of first and third year
   surgical residents and critical care fellows.
   RESULTS: The item that most strongly differentiated the bottom 5 from
   the top 5 performers was not answering the patient appropriately. This
   was exhibited in 3 ways among the lowest performers in our study: (1)
   paternalism, (2) vagueness, and (3) dehumanization. Our statistical
   analyses showed that the overall number of negative communication
   behaviors correlated with negative staff scores (r = 0.653, p < 0.05).
   Dehumanization and paternalism were the 2 behaviors most strongly
   correlated with negative staff scores (r = 0.796 and 0.781 respectively,
   p < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: We found the lowest performers responded inappropriately to
   the patient, which we further delineated into vagueness, paternalism,
   and dehumanization. We propose positive communication strategies be
   taught to residents to improve how they are perceived by patients. (J

Title = {Academic Medical Centers Forming Accountable Care Organizations and
   Partnering With Community Providers: The Experience of the Johns Hopkins
   Medicine Alliance for Patients},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {91},
Number = {3},
Pages = {328-332},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Academic medical centers (AMCs)-which include teaching hospital(s) and
   additional care delivery entities-that form accountable care
   organizations (ACOs) must decide whether to partner with other provider
   entities, such as community practices. Indeed, 67\% (33/49) of AMC ACOs
   through the Medicare Shared Savings Program through 2014 are believed to
   include an outside community practice. There are opportunities for both
   the AMC and the community partners in pursuing such relationships,
   including possible alignment around shared goals and adding ACO
   beneficiaries.
   To create the Johns Hopkins Medicine Alliance for Patients (JMAP), in
   January 2014, Johns Hopkins Medicine chose to partner with two community
   primary care groups and one cardiology practice to support clinical
   integration while adding approximately 60 providers and 5,000 Medicare
   beneficiaries. The principal initial interventions within JMAP included
   care coordination for high-risk beneficiaries and later, in 2014,
   generating dashboards of ACO quality measures to facilitate quality
   improvement and early efforts at incorporating clinical pathways and
   Choosing Wisely recommendations. Additional interventions began in 2015.
   The principal initial challenges JMAP faced were data integration,
   generation of quality measure reports among disparate electronic medical
   records, receiving and then analyzing claims data, and seeking to
   achieve provider engagement; all these affected timely deployment of the
   early interventions. JMAP also created three regional advisory councils
   as a forum promoting engagement of local leadership. Network strategies
   among AMCs, including adding community practices in a nonemployment
   model, will continue to require thoughtful strategic planning and a keen
   understanding of local context.},

Title = {Choosing a women's health career},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {NOV 6},
Abstract = {BackgroundIn 2005, in response to a decline in residency applications in
   obstetrics and gynecology (OB GYN), the American College of Obstetrics
   and Gynecology Presidential Task Force outlined strategies for
   attracting medical students to OB GYN. Application rates have increased
   since then, but little is known about which interventions are effective.
   We aimed to identify modifiable and nonmodifiable variables that may
   contribute to students choosing OB GYN for their careers; this
   information could be used to inform curriculum design, faculty
   development, and innovative exposures to women's health.MethodsThis
   qualitative study received institutional review board approval. Eligible
   participants were students who applied or recently matched into OB GYN
   residency programs from the class of 2014-2016 at our institution.
   Students were interviewed with open-ended questions and a Likert-type
   survey. Thematic analysis was performed.ResultsTen qualitative
   interviews were completed and analyzed. Intrinsic themes such as the
   potential for a meaningful job in women's health, advocacy for women, or
   empowerment of women were identified as factors contributing to
   participant career choice. Extrinsic themes such as positive impressions
   during the clinical clerkship and welcoming teams were also identified.
   Most students indicated that the clerkship was the most influential
   experience.ConclusionsParticipants identified important events,
   including some that even preceded medical school that guided them toward
   OB GYN. The data guide us to consider the importance of emphasizing the
   unique combination of characteristics in OB GYN and improving the
   learning environment in the clerkship as a way to encourage student
   recruitment.},

Abstract = {Day trading has become an important topic of discussion in the last
   decades, especially with regard to computer program trading or the
   increasing trend of high-frequency transactions. However, due to the
   high level of complexity regarding the forecasting of day trading
   trends, the use of traditional financial analysis or technical
   indicators for the forecasting of short-term market trends is often
   ineffective. The main reason is that in addition to the technical
   analysis of market physical trends, financial market trading behaviors
   are also often affected by psychological factors such as greed and fear,
   which are emotions displayed by investors during the transaction
   process. For this reason, this study will use the neural network to
   integrate into the financial engineering technology analysis of the
   physical momentum behavior and market profile theory to quantify
   controlled learning. The goal is to be able to provide an empirical
   explanation of the discoveries related to trading behaviors by using
   trading strategies. Our experiments showed that trading behaviors in the
   financial market could be explained by the physical trends of a
   quantitative and technical analysis of the market profile theory. It has
   also been proven that the financial trading market follows the existence
   of a certain trading logic. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Nektar plus plus : Enhancing the capability and application of
   high-fidelity spectral/hp element methods},
Journal = {COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {249},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Nektar++ is an open-source framework that provides a flexible,
   high-performance and scalable platform for the development of solvers
   for partial differential equations using the high-order spectral/hp
   element method. In particular, Nektar++ aims to overcome the complex
   implementation challenges that are often associated with high-order
   methods, thereby allowing them to be more readily used in a wide range
   of application areas. In this paper, we present the algorithmic,
   implementation and application developments associated with our Nektar++
   version 5.0 release. We describe some of the key software and
   performance developments, including our strategies on parallel I/O, on
   in situ processing, the use of collective operations for exploiting
   current and emerging hardware, and interfaces to enable multi-solver
   coupling. Furthermore, we provide details on a newly developed Python
   interface that enables a more rapid introduction for new users
   unfamiliar with spectral/hp element methods, C++ and/or Nektar++. This
   release also incorporates a number of numerical method developments - in
   particular: the method of moving frames (MMF), which provides an
   additional approach for the simulation of equations on embedded
   curvilinear manifolds and domains; a means of handling spatially
   variable polynomial order; and a novel technique for quasi-3D
   simulations (which combine a 2D spectral element and 1D Fourier spectral
   method) to permit spatially-varying perturbations to the geometry in the
   homogeneous direction. Finally, we demonstrate the new application-level
   features provided in this release, namely: a facility for generating
   high-order curvilinear meshes called NekMesh; a novel new AcousticSolver
   for aeroacoustic problems; our development of a `thick' strip model for
   the modelling of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems in the
   context of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV). We conclude by commenting on
   some lessons learned and by discussing some directions for future code
   development and expansion.

Title = {Coexistence in heterogeneous spectrum through distributed correlated
   equilibrium in cognitive radio networks},
Journal = {COMPUTER NETWORKS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {98},
Pages = {109-122},
Month = {APR 7},
Abstract = {Coexistence protocols enable collocated cognitive radio networks (CRNs)
   to share the spectrum in an opportunistic manner. These protocols work
   under the assumption that all spectrum bands provide the same level of
   throughput. This assumption is however limited in scope because channel
   conditions as well as the licensee's usage of allocated channels can
   vary significantly with time and space. Under these circumstances, CRNs
   are expected to have a preference over the choice of available channels
   which can lead to an imbalance in contention for disparate channels,
   degraded quality of service, and an overall inefficient utilization of
   spectrum resource. In this paper, we analyze this situation from a game
   theoretic perspective and model the coexistence of CRNs with
   heterogeneous spectrum as a non-cooperative, repeated spectrum sharing
   game. We derive three solutions for the game; (1) pure and (2) mixed
   strategy Nash Equilibria as well as (3) centralized and distributed
   correlated equilibria which are derived using linear programming and a
   channel selection learning algorithms, respectively. We also analyze
   each of these solutions from the perspective of fairness and efficiency.
   To that end, we utilize the concept of price of anarchy to measure the
   efficiency of these solutions under selfish behavior from CRNs. (C) 2016

Title = {Next-Generation Edge Computing Assisted Autonomous Driving Based
   Artificial Intelligence Algorithms},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {53987-54001},
Abstract = {Edge Computing and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) concepts can
   improve network processing and multi-resources allocation when
   intelligent optimization algorithms are deployed. Multiservice
   offloading and allocation approaches pose interesting challenges in the
   current and next-generation vehicle networks. The state-of-the-art
   optimization approaches still formulate exact algorithms, and tune
   approximation methods to get sufficient solutions. These approaches are
   data-centric that aim to use heterogeneous data inputs to find the near
   optimal solutions. In the context of connected and autonomous vehicles
   (CAVs), these techniques show an exponential computational time and deal
   only with small and medium scale networks. Therefore, we are motivated
   by using recent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to learn
   the behavior of exact optimization algorithms while enhancing the
   Quality of Service (QoS) of network operators and satisfying the
   requirements of the next-generation Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). DRL
   algorithms can improve AVs service offloading and optimize edge
   resources. An Optimal Virtual Edge Autopilot Placement (OVEAP) algorithm
   is proposed using Integer Linear Programming (ILP). Moreover, an
   autopilot placement protocol is presented to support the algorithm.
   Optimal allocation and Virtual Network Function (VNF) placement and
   chaining of the autopilot, based on several new constraints such as
   computing and networking loads, network edge infrastructure, and
   placement cost, are designed. Further, a DRL approach is formulated to
   deal with dense Internet of Autonomous Vehicle (IoAV) networks.
   Extensive simulations and evaluations are carried out. Results show that
   the proposed allocation strategies outperform the state-of-the-art
   solutions and give better performance in terms of Total Edge Servers
   Utilization, Total Edge Servers Allocation Time, and Successfully
   Allocated autopilots.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND School connectedness (SC) is associated with improved health
   and academic outcomes. The purposes of this study were to explore
   factors contributing to students' perceptions of SC and if participation
   in structured recreation at school was associated with SC. METHODS We
   used concurrent mixed-methods including cross-sectional qualitative data
   to explore factors contributing to SC among fifth- and sixth-grade
   students at 2 schools in Phoenix, AZ, USA (N = 330), and quantitative
   measures to explore the association between SC and recreation
   participation (N = 129). Students completed a journaling activity to
   identify factors contributing to feelings of SC. Responses were analyzed
   using both deductive and inductive approaches. Student surveys were
   analyzed using 1-way analyses of variance to assess differences between
   participation level and SC. RESULTS Eight themes contributing to SC
   emerged: Relationships (peer, adult), Competence (competence), Autonomy
   (choice), Relax (relax), Recreation (structured, play), Fun (fun),
   Academics (academic learning), and Environment (food and safety).
   Participation in structured recreation programming in the classroom and
   at recess were associated with higher levels of SC (p < .05).
   CONCLUSIONS School practitioners can integrate opportunities for
   structured recreation in the classroom and at recess as a fun and
   engaging strategy to foster adult support and peer relationships,
   enhancing SC.},

Abstract = {With the development of internet of things (IoT) technology,
   servitization of IoT device functions has become a trend. The
   cooperation between IoT devices can be equivalent to web service
   composition. However, current service composition approaches applied in
   the internet cannot work well in IoT environments due to weak
   adaptability, low accuracy, and poor time performance. This paper, based
   on service dependency graph, proposes a top -k QoS-optimal service
   composition approach suitable for IoT. It aims to construct the
   relationship between services by applying the service dependency model
   and to reduce the traversal space through effective filtering
   strategies. On the basis of a composition path traversal sequence, the
   generated service composition can be represented directly to avoid
   backtracking search. Meanwhile, the redundant services can be removed
   from the service composition with the help of dynamic programming.
   Experiments show that the approach can obtain the top -k QoS-optimal
   service composition and better time performance.},

Abstract = {Accurate and steady wind speed prediction is essential for the efficient
   management of wind power factories and energy systems. However, it is
   difficult to obtain satisfactory forecasting performance because of the
   characteristics of random nonlinear fluctuations inherent in wind speed
   variation. Considering the drawbacks of statistical models in
   forecasting nonlinear time series and the problem of artificial
   intelligence models easily falling into a local optimum, in this study,
   we successfully integrate the variable weighted combination theory into
   a new combined forecasting model that simultaneously consists of three
   disparate hybrid models based on the decomposition technology. Moreover,
   the extreme learning machine optimized by the multi-objective
   grasshopper optimization algorithm is adopted to integrate all the
   forecasting results derived from each hybrid model to further enhance
   the forecasting accuracy. In this study, we consider a case study that
   employs several authentic wind speed data aggregates of Shandong wind
   farms for an evaluation of the forecasting performance of the proposed
   combined model. The experimental results reveal that this proposed model
   surpasses the contrasted benchmark models and is satisfactory for
   intellective grid programs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The Pareto Analysis for Establishing Content Criteria in Surgical
   Training},

Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Current surgical training is still highly dependent on
   expensive operating room (OR) experience. Although there have been many
   attempts to transfer more training to the skills laboratory, little
   research is focused on which technical behaviors can lead to the highest
   profit when they are trained outside the OR. The Pareto principle states
   that in any population that contributes to a common effect, a few
   account for the bulk of the effect. This principle has been widely used
   in business management to increase company profits. This study uses the
   Pareto principle for establishing content criteria for more efficient
   surgical training.
   METHOD: A retrospective study was conducted to assess verbal guidance
   provided by 9 supervising surgeons to 12 trainees performing 64
   laparoscopic cholecystectomies in the OR. The verbal corrections were
   documented, tallied, and clustered according to the aimed change in
   novice behavior. The corrections were rank ordered, and a cumulative
   distribution curve was used to calculate which corrections accounted for
   80\% of the total number of verbal corrections.
   RESULTS: In total, 253 different verbal corrections were uttered 1587
   times and were categorized into 40 different clusters of aimed changes
   in novice behaviors. The 35 highest-ranking verbal corrections (14\%)
   and the 11 highest-ranking clusters (28\%) accounted for 80\% of the
   total number of given verbal corrections.
   CONCLUSIONS: Following the Pareto principle, we were able to identify
   the aspects of trainee behavior that account for most corrections given
   by supervisors during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on humans. This
   strategy can be used for the development of new training programs to
   prepare the trainee in advance for the challenges encountered in the
   clinical setting in an OR. (C) 2016 Association of Program Directors in

Title = {Exploring the Networking of Academic Health Science Leaders: How and Why
   Do They Do It?},

Abstract = {Purpose Networking is essential to leadership effectiveness in the
   business context. Yet little is known about leadership networking within
   the academic health science context. If we are going to train academic
   leaders, we must first understand the relational, network-based
   activities of their work. The purpose of this study was to explore how
   academic health science leaders engage in networking activities in the
   academic health science context. Method A constructivist grounded theory
   approach guided our study. The authors interviewed 24 academic health
   science leaders who were enrolled in the New and Evolving Academic
   Leadership program at the University of Toronto and used social network
   mapping as an elicitation method. Interviews, which were conducted
   between September 2014 and June 2015, explored participants' networks
   and networking activities. Constant comparative analysis was used to
   analyze the interviews, with attention paid to identifying key
   networking activities. Results Academic health science leaders were
   found to engage in 4 types of networking activities: role bound, project
   based, goal/vision informed, and opportunity driven. These 4 types were
   influenced by participants' conception of their role and their perceived
   leadership work context, which in turn influenced their sense of agency.
   Conclusions The networking activities identified in this study of
   academic health science leaders resonate with effective networking
   activities found in other fields. The findings highlight that these
   activities can be facilitated by focusing on leaders' perceptions about
   role and work context. Leadership development should thus attend to
   these perceptions to encourage effective networking skills.},

Abstract = {Background Despite widespread efforts to create wellness programming in
   medical schools, there is a paucity of literature examining students'
   perception of wellness and perceptions of these programs. With the
   inaugural class at the Arizona campus of Mayo Clinic Alix School of
   Medicine (MCASOM-AZ), an opportunity arose to establish an empirically
   evaluated wellness curriculum that most inclusively and effectively
   enables medical students to flourish for years to come. The initial
   wellness offerings included mental health, academic success, and
   disability services, curriculum-embedded seminars, wellness committee
   driven programming, and student-proposed wellness activities. We aimed
   to improve the relevance and impact of medical school wellness curricula
   by soliciting in-depth and longitudinal perspectives of medical students
   themselves. As MCASOM-AZ opened in 2017, the student body at the time of
   study consisted of first- and second-year medical students. Methods
   Employing a mixed methods analysis of qualitative and longitudinal
   quantitative data, first- and second-year students at a MCASOM-AZ were
   invited to respond to an anonymous, online year-long survey (baseline,
   six months and 12 months) during the 2018-2019 academic year and
   participate in a structured, in-depth and in-person, peer-to-peer
   interview about their conceptions of wellness and the MCASOM-AZ wellness
   curriculum and resources. Qualitative data was coded for themes using
   thematic analysis strategies by independent raters. Results Nearly half
   of eligible students completed the baseline survey,1/3 completed all 3
   time-points, and 1/5 participated in an in-depth interview. Participant
   age, gender, and year of school were representative of the larger
   student body. Although individual conceptions varied, Wellness was
   consistently highly valued. Family, Academic Performance, and Friends
   emerged as most important to well-being across time-points. Academic
   work arose as the largest barrier to wellness. Analysis of qualitative
   data revealed five themes. Despite individual differences in approaches
   to wellness, wellbeing was interrelated to the learning environment;
   mandatory wellness efforts that didn't address the medical culture met
   with skepticism. Conclusions Interview responses provided understanding
   and context by which to interpret questionnaire responses. Academics was
   critical to students' identity and wellness, while also the largest
   barrier. Suggested curricular improvements include restructuring
   academic work, seamlessly integrating wellness within coursework, and
   offering optional individualized approaches.},

Title = {Are You Thinking What I'm Thinking? Exploring Response Process Validity
   Evidence for a Workplace-based Assessment for Operative Feedback},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Workplace-based assessments (WBAs) are used in multiple
   surgical specialties to facilitate feedback to residents as a form of
   formative assessment. The validity evidence to support this purpose is
   limited and has yet to include investigations of how users interpret the
   assessment and make rating decisions (response processes). This study
   aimed to explore the validity evidence based on response processes for a
   WBA in surgery. DESIGN: Semi-structured interviews explored the
   reasonings and strategies used when answering questions in a surgical
   WBA, the System for Improving and Measuring Procedural Learning (SIMPL).
   Interview questions probed the interpretation of the three assessment
   questions and their respective answer categories (level of autonomy,
   operative performance, case complexity). Researchers analyzed
   transcripts using directed qualitative content analysis to generate
   themes. SETTING: Single tertiary academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS:
   Eight residents and 13 faculty within the Department of
   Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery participating in a 6-month pilot of
   SIMPL. RESULTS: We identified four overarching themes that that
   characterized faculty and resident response processes while completing
   SIMPL: (1) Faculty and resident users had similar content-level
   interpretations of the questions and corresponding answer choices; (2)
   Users employed a variety of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional
   processes to make rating decisions; (3) Contextual factors influenced
   ratings; and (4) Tensions during inter- pretation contributed to rating
   uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: Response processes are a key source of
   evidence to support the validity for the formative use of WBAs.
   Evaluating response process evidence should go beyond basic
   content-level analysis as contextual factors and tensions that arise
   during interpretation also play a large role in rating decisions.
   Additional work and a con- tinued critical lens are needed to ensure
   that WBAs can truly meet the needs for formative assessment. (J Surg Ed

Abstract = {Motivation: The rapid progress of gene expression profiling has
   facilitated the prosperity of recent biological studies in various
   fields, where gene expression data characterizes various cell conditions
   and regulatory mechanisms under different experimental circumstances.
   Despite the widespread application of gene expression profiling and
   advances in high-throughput technologies, profiling in genome-wide level
   is still expensive and difficult. Previous studies found that high
   correlation exists in the expression pattern of different genes, such
   that a small subset of genes can be informative to approximately
   describe the entire transcriptome. In the Library of Integrated
   Network-based Cell-Signature program, a set of similar to 1000 landmark
   genes have been identified that contain similar to 80\% information of
   the whole genome and can be used to predict the expression of remaining
   genes. For a cost-effective profiling strategy, traditional methods
   measure the profiles of landmark genes and then infer the expression of
   other target genes via linear models. However, linear models do not have
   the capacity to capture the non-linear associations in gene regulatory
   networks.
   Results: As a flexible model with high representative power, deep
   learning models provide an alternate to interpret the complex relation
   among genes. In this paper, we propose a deep learning architecture for
   the inference of target gene expression profiles. We construct a novel
   conditional generative adversarial network by incorporating both the
   adversarial and l(1)-norm loss terms in our model. Unlike the smooth and
   blurry predictions resulted by mean squared error objective, the coupled
   adversarial and l(1)-norm loss function leads to more accurate and sharp
   predictions. We validate our method under two different settings and
   find consistent and significant improvements over all the comparing
   methods.},

Abstract = {In the Web Service Composition (WSC) domain, Web Services (WSs) execute
   in a highly dynamic environment, as a result, the Quality of Service
   (QoS) of a WS is constantly evolving, and this requires tracking of the
   global optimization overtime to satisfy the users' requirements. In
   order to make a WSC adapt to such QoS changes of WSs, we propose a
   self-healing model for WSC. Self-healing is the automatic discovery, and
   healing of the failure of a composite WS by itself due to QoS changes
   without interruption in the WSC and any human intervention. To the best
   of our knowledge, almost all the existing self-healing models in this
   domain substitute the faulty WS with an equivalent one without paying
   attention to the WS selection processes to achieve global optimization.
   They focus only on the WS substitution strategy. In this paper, we
   propose a self-healing model where we use our hybrid approach to find
   the optimal WSC by using Parallel Genetic Algorithm based on Q-learning,
   which we integrate with K-means clustering (PGAQK). The components of
   this model are organized according to IBM's Monitor, Analyse, Plan,
   Execute, and Knowledge (NAPE-K) reference model. The PGAQK approach
   considers as a module in the Execute component. WS substitution strategy
   has also been applied in this model that substitutes the faulty WS with
   another equivalent one from a list of candidate WSs by using the K-means
   clustering technique. K-means clustering is used to prune the WSs in the
   search space to find the best WSs for the environment changes. We
   implemented this model over the NET Framework using C\# programming
   language. A series of comparable experiments showed that the proposed
   model outperforms improved GA to achieve global optimization. Our
   proposed model also can dynamically substitute the faulty WSs with other
   equivalent ones in a time-efficient manner.},

Abstract = {The Inclusive Environments and Metrics in Biology Education and Research
   (iEMBER) network is a newly forming national community of practice that
   engages diversity, equity, and inclusion stakeholders in
   interdisciplinary collaborative projects. iEMBER was initiated with
   incubator funding from the National Science Foundation program for
   Research Coordination Networks in Undergraduate Biology Education. In
   June 2017, biology education researchers, social scientists, biologists,
   and program and policy administrators, all with interests in diversity,
   equity, and inclusion, met to lay the foundation for the iEMBER network.
   iEMBER provides a distinct forum to coordinate efforts through
   networking, professional development, and the initiation of
   collaborative research. iEMBER advances science, technology,
   engineering, and mathematics reform focused on diversity, equity, and
   inclusion through the initiation of research teams at the iEMBER
   biennial conference and outreach efforts at discipline-specific meetings
   and conferences. The focus of iEMBER is on understanding how to create
   inclusive, supportive, and engaging environments to foster the success
   of all biology students and trainees. This report focuses on the
   structure of the iEMBER network, two takeaways that emerged from the
   2017 conference (interdisciplinary networking/collaboration and
   intradisciplinary broadening participation strategies), and ways for
   prospective members to engage in ongoing dialogue and future events.},

Abstract = {The inappropriate mechanism designs for demand response (DR) in the
   community of microgirds (CoMGs) may cause massive problems, such as
   increase of consumers' costs, rebound peaks, and thereby lack of
   optimality in the network. In this article, a bilevel energy management
   system (EMS) is proposed to tackle the challenges associated with DR
   programs for CoMGs. The current structure successfully models users'
   behavior and dissatisfaction in the first level of optimization to
   develop best DR program for each of them. Moreover, in the second level,
   power system constraints are taken into account to prevent voltage and
   current deviation from their statutory limits. Each user is assumed to
   be part of a microgrid (MG) whose operation is controlled and optimized
   through its local EMS in the first level. On the other hand, the overall
   operation of all MGs is delegated to the whole system operator, which
   acts as the central EMS (CEMS) in the second level. An iterative
   transactive energy management method is proposed by CEMS to fairly limit
   the excess power of the MGs one day ahead for voltage and current
   regulation. The obtained results indicate the effectiveness of the
   proposed structure in preventing discomfort issues, voltage deviation
   and creation of the rebound peaks in the system.},

Abstract = {Women and minorities remain underrepresented in chemistry bachelor's
   degree attainment in the United States, despite efforts to improve their
   early chemistry achievement through supplemental academic programs and
   active-learning approaches. We propose an additional strategy for
   addressing these disparities: course-based, social-psychological
   interventions. For example, growth-mindset interventions are designed to
   support students during challenging academic transitions by encouraging
   them to view intelligence as a flexible characteristic that can be
   developed through practice, rather than a fixed ability. Previous
   research has shown that such interventions can improve the overall
   performance and persistence of college students, particularly those who
   belong to underrepresented groups. We report a random-assignment
   classroom experiment, which implemented a chemistry-specific
   growth-mindset intervention among first-year college students enrolled
   in General Chemistry 1. Performance results revealed an achievement gap
   between underrepresented minority and white students in the control
   group, but no sex-based gap. Critically, after adjusting for variation
   in academic preparation, the mindset intervention eliminated this
   racial-achievement gap. Qualitative analysis of students' written
   reflections from the intervention shed light on their experiences of the
   mindset and control treatments, deepening our understanding of mindset
   effects. We integrate these results with the mindset and chemical
   education literatures and discuss the implications for educators seeking
   to support underrepresented students in their own classrooms.},

Abstract = {Context: Cybersecurity behavioral literature has a significant number of
   studies on training and aware-ness. However, there is lack of
   theoretical underpinnings in developing intervention to allow for
   positive behavioral change and evaluating them. The evaluation of theory
   based cybersecurity training warrants the use of program evaluation
   techniques.Objective: The protection motivation theory (PMT) was
   employed to understand the behavioral change af-ter the implementation
   of cybersecurity training. The evaluation was done on three levels of
   Kirkpatrick's evaluation model - reaction, learning and behavior.Method:
   A pre-post quasi experimental design was adopted in this research. A
   total of 154 undergraduate students from computing and digital arts
   backgrounds took part in the research.Results: The results of the study
   showed that the PMT based training was effective in increasing the
   threat knowledge of the students along with the increase in information
   of countermeasure strategies. From the two components of the PMT,
   self-efficacy was found to be the significant predictor of the
   cy-bersecurity behavioral intention in both pre-test and post-test PMT
   models. The cybersecurity training increased the self-efficacy of the
   students significantly and contributed towards cybersecurity behavioral
   intention change. The findings of this study imply that in designing the
   cybersecurity trainings, educators should dominantly take into account
   the self-efficacy component of the PMT.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Automated Software Test Data Generation With Generative Adversarial
   Networks},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {20690-20700},
Abstract = {With the rapid increase of software scale and complexity, the cost of
   traditional software testing methods will increase faster than the scale
   of software. In order to improve test efficiency, it is particularly
   important to automatically generate high-quality test cases. This paper
   introduces a framework for automatic test data generation based on the
   generative adversarial network (GAN). GAN is employed to train a
   generative model over execution path information to learn the behavior
   of the software. Then we can use the trained generative model to produce
   new test data, and select the test data that can improve the branch
   coverage according to our proposed selection strategy. Compared to prior
   work, our proposed method is able to handle programs under test with
   large-scale branches without analyzing branch expressions. In the
   experiment, we exhibit the performance of our method by using two
   modules in GNU Scientific Library. In particular, we consider the
   application of our method in two testing scenarios; unit testing and
   integration testing, and conduct a series of experiments to compare the
   performance of three types of GAN models. Results indicate that the
   WGAN-GP shows the best performance in our framework. Compared with the
   random testing method, the WGAN-GP based framework improves the test
   coverage of five functions out of the seven in the unit testing.},

Abstract = {Demand side management (DSM) programs are an integral part of the modern

   by the forecasted load. An error in the hour ahead load forecasting
   results in a suboptimal solution entailing economic cost to both the
   utility and the customers. Predicting loads at a fine granularity (e.g.,
   households) is challenging due to a large number of (known or unknown)
   factors affecting power consumption. At larger scales (e.g., clusters of
   consumers), since the inherent stochasticity and fluctuations are
   averaged out, the problem becomes substantially easier. Many techniques
   have been proposed to predict loads of clusters of consumers in various
   localities with great accuracy. Also, these techniques generally utilize
   sociological and weather information and work better on data from a
   particular locality. In this paper, a new technique called Past Vector
   Similarity (PVS) has been proposed to predict electricity load one hour
   ahead at the level of an individual household. The proposed strategy is
   based on load information only and does not require calendar, weather or
   any other attributes. In fact, the idea is to extract the exact load
   patterns of individual households corresponding to their routine and
   socio-economic values. Consequently, the technique makes use of the
   recent past vector and generate similar patterns for the prediction of
   future load profiles. Furthermore, the ensemble of these similar loads
   is an efficient prediction of electricity. PVS has just two parameters
   due to which it can be applied to the smaller dataset without
   overfitting issue. Moreover, due to the parallel nature of PVS, it can
   be scaled for a large number of customers without computation burden.
   The proposed PVS has been assessed empirically for two distinct datasets
   from Australia and Sweden. The simulation results demonstrate that the
   PVS significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art forecasting methods
   in terms of accuracy.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This study aimed to conduct an in-depth investigation into
   physical education data sources and collection procedures in a district
   that was awarded a Physical Education Program (PEP) grant. Method: A
   qualitative, multi-site case study was conducted in which a single
   school district was the overarching case and eight schools served as
   embedded cases. Results: Findings indicated that physical education
   teachers collected substantial amounts of data related to physical
   activity, fitness, and nutritional behaviors as required by the PEP
   grant. Data related to other physical education standards, but not
   required by the grant, were not collected. Evidence indicated that the
   data collection/management process was time-consuming and teachers had
   concerns over data quality. Conclusion: Federal grant requirements have
   substantial influence on the types of data collected in physical
   education and should be reviewed to ensure alignment with standards and
   best practices in the field. Effective strategies are needed to reduce
   the amount of time teachers spend on data collection and to ensure data
   quality.},

Title = {A process evaluation of PRONTO simulation training for obstetric and
   neonatal emergency response teams in Guatemala},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2015},

Abstract = {Background: Despite expanding access to institutional birth in
   Guatemala, maternal mortality remains largely unchanged over the last
   ten years. Enhancing the quality of emergency obstetric and neonatal
   care is one important strategy to decrease mortality. An innovative,
   low-tech, simulation-based team training program (PRONTO) aims to
   optimize care provided during obstetric and neonatal emergencies in
   low-resource settings.
   Methods: We conducted PRONTO simulation training between July 2012 and
   December 2012 in 15 clinics in Alta Verapaz, Huehuetenango, San Marcos,
   and Quiche, Guatemala. These clinics received PRONTO as part of a larger
   pair-matched cluster randomized trial of a comprehensive intervention
   package. Training participants were obstetric and neonatal care
   providers that completed pre- and post-training assessments for the two
   PRONTO training modules, which evaluated knowledge of evidence-based
   practice and self-efficacy in obstetric and neonatal topics. Part of the
   training included a session for trained teams to establish strategic
   goals to improve clinical practice. We utilized a pre/post-test design
   to evaluate the impact of the course on both knowledge and self-efficacy
   with longitudinal fixed effects linear regression with robust standard
   errors. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess the
   correlation between knowledge and self-efficacy. Poisson regression was
   used to assess the association between the number of goals achieved and
   knowledge, self-efficacy, and identified facility-level factors.
   Results: Knowledge and self-efficacy scores improved significantly in
   all areas of teaching. Scores were correlated for all topics overall at
   training completion. More than 60 \% of goals set to improve clinic
   functioning and emergency care were achieved. No predictors of goal
   achievement were identified.
   Conclusions: PRONTO training is effective at improving provider
   knowledge and self-efficacy in training areas. Further research is
   needed to evaluate the impact of the training on provider use of
   evidence-based practices and on maternal and neonatal health outcomes.},

Abstract = {It has long been held that participation in sport, physical activity
   (PA) and physical education (PE) can yield valuable benefits for young
   people (Bailey et al., 2009. The educational benefits claimed for
   physical education and school sport: An academic review. Research Papers
   in Education, 24(1), 1-27. https://doi.org/10.1080/02671520701809817).
   Recently, there has been much focus on the role of such activities for
   moral development in support of social inclusion and social justice
   agendas, often centred within the broad field of sport-for-development
   (Coalter, 2013. Sport for development. Routledge; Rossi \& Jeanes, 2016.
   Education, pedagogy and sport for development: Addressing seldom asked
   questions. Sport, Education and Society, 21(4), 483-494.
   https://doi.org/10.1080/13573322.2016.1160373). However, disability, and
   the social inclusion of disabled people, has been somewhat overlooked by
   policy, practice, and research in this field. This article considers
   findings from a study investigating a sports-based educational
   programme, Playdagogy, designed for use with children/young people and
   intended to: (1) raise disability-awareness, (2) promote positive
   attitudes to disabled people and (3) foster inclusion. In focusing on
   promoting understandings of disability and inclusion through `inclusive'
   sport-based games, Playdagogy reflects a recognition of the need to
   critique `normalized' and exclusionary conceptions and practices in
   youth sport (Fitzgerald, 2009. Disability and youth sport. Routledge).
   While progress has been made to conceptualise `anti-disablist' or
   `anti-ableist' pedagogies within the context of inclusive education
   (Beckett, 2015. Anti-oppressive pedagogy and disability: Possibilities
   and challenges. Scandinavian Journal of Disability Research, 17(1),
   76-94. ), it has been slow to trace this into relevant curricula or
   teaching/learning strategies (Symeonidou \& Loizou, 2018. Disability
   studies as a framework to design disability awareness programs: No need
   for `magic' to facilitate children's understanding. Disability \&
   Society, 33(8), 1234-1258.
   https://doi.org/10.1080/09687599.2018.1488677). Playdagogy can be viewed
   as an attempt to achieve translation of pedagogy into practice. A mixed
   method approach was employed to capture experiences of programme staff,
   educators, and pupils (aged 6-12 ) involved in the Playdagogy programme.
   Findings highlight key issues related to the experience of delivering
   and undertaking Playdagogy activities from all stakeholders'
   perspectives. In acknowledging claims that educational messages are
   often inherent but not explicit within these kinds of sport for
   development programmes (Rossi \& Jeanes, 2016. Education, pedagogy and
   sport for development: Addressing seldom asked questions. Sport,
   Education and Society, 21(4), 483-494.
   https://doi.org/10.1080/13573322.2016.1160373), we add to calls for
   closer examination of the educational process and impact of such
   initiatives and examine the place of an inclusion/disability focus in
   future SfD work.},

Abstract = {PURPOSE: Achievement goal orientation (GO) theory describes Mastery (M),
   one's intrinsic drive for competency for the sake of competency, and
   performance approach (PAP), a drive for competency by displaying
   competency, which are both adaptive. In learners motivated by
   performance avoid (PAV), showing competency by avoiding appearing
   incompetent dominates (maladaptive). The aim of this study was to
   determine differences in GO by gender and training (PGY) level.
   METHODS: A prospective, multi-institutional cohort of general surgery
   trainees participated in a cross-sectional study (2020-2021).
   Participants completed a 10-item instrument (the Goal Orientation in
   Surgical Trainees, GO-ST) measured on a 5-pointLikert scale (1 = never,3
   = weekly,5 = daily). Student's t-tests and ANOVA F-test were used as
   appropriate.
   RESULTS: A total of 144/164 trainees participated (87.8\%). The sample
   was 40.0\%(n = 56) female and 57.9\%(n = 81) male; 21.3\%(n = 30) were
   PGY1, 22.0\% (n = 31) PGY2, 24.8\%(n = 35) PGY3, 18.4\%(n = 26) PGY4,
   13.5\%(n = 19) PGY5. There were no significant differences in mean scale
   scores by gender for Mastery (3.3 vs 3.5; p = 0.17), or PAP (3.7 vs 3.5;
   p = 0.10), but mean PAV scores were significantly higher for females
   (3.6 vs 3.3; p = 0.04). While there were no significant differences in
   mean Mastery and PAP scale scores by training level (p = 0.44; p =
   0.31), there was a significant difference in PAV scores (p < 0.01). The
   frequency of PAV feelings decreased over 5 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: Only PAV motivation differed by gender and training level.
   Understanding the psychology of motivation with this framework can aid
   both residents and programs in re-focusing on more adaptive learning
   strategies and supporting trainees in their transition to master
   surgeons. (C) 2022 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

Abstract = {Spaced education is a learning strategy to improve knowledge acquisition
   and retention. To date, no robust evidence exists to support the utility
   of spaced education in the Family Medicine residency. We aimed to test
   whether alerts to encourage spaced education can improve clinical
   knowledge as measured by scores on the Canadian Family Medicine
   certification examination. Method: We conducted a cluster randomized
   controlled trial to empirically and pragmatically test spaced education
   using two versions of the Family Medicine Study Guide mobile app. 12
   residency training programs in Canada agreed to participate. At six
   intervention sites, we consented 335 of the 654 (51\%) eligible
   residents. Residents in the intervention group were sent alerts through
   the app to encourage the answering of questions linked to clinical
   cases. At six control sites, 299 of 586 (51\%) residents consented.
   Residents in the control group received the same app but with no alerts.
   Incidence rates of case completion between trial arms were compared
   using repeated measures analysis. We linked residents in both trial arms
   to their knowledge scores on the certification examination of the
   College of Family Physicians of Canada. Results: Over 67 weeks, there
   was no statistically significant difference in the completion of
   clinical cases by participants. The difference in mean exam scores and
   the associated confidence interval did not exceed the pre-defined limit
   of 4 percentage points. Conclusion: Further research is recommended
   before deploying spaced educational interventions in the Family Medicine
   residency to improve knowledge.},

Abstract = {This paper presents Industrial Robotics Simulation Design Planning and
   Optimization platform named IRoSim, which is based on SolidWorks
   Application Programming Interface (API) to offer an intuitive and
   convertible environment for designing and simulating robotized tasks.
   The core idea is to integrate features of mechanical CAD and robotics
   CAD into the same platform to facilitate the development process through
   the designed Graphical User Interface (GUI) which permits user friendly
   interaction. The platform includes various 3D models that are essential
   for developing any robotized task and offers possibility to integrate
   new models in simulation. Robotic manipulator library is one such
   example which contains several types of serial arms with different
   combinations of revolute and prismatic joints. The platform provides
   most important steps such as defining the task, CAD learning of the
   end-effector's trajectory, checking the manipulator's reachability to
   perform a task, simulating the motion and finally validating the
   manipulator's trajectory to avoid possible collisions. To demonstrate
   the efficiency of the proposed approach, two frequent and important
   tasks (spot welding and painting) using a 6-Degree Of Freedom (DOF)
   industrial robotic manipulator have been considered. The output of the
   proposed strategy provides collision-free trajectory of the
   manipulator's motion which can be directly mapped to a real site.
   Moreover, the approach permits addressing the problems related with the
   real implementation of robotized tasks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Understanding ethical decision-making in design},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Background Little is known about how students engage in ethical
   decision-making, especially when designing in messy, real-life contexts.
   To prepare ethically competent engineers, educators need a richer
   understanding of students' ethical decision-making throughout the course
   of the design process.
   Purpose/Hypothesis This study examines students' intuitive ethical
   decision-making as it emerges throughout the design process as well as
   when and how students engage in ethical reflection. Outlining these
   processes enables educators to better structure and support students'
   ethical reasoning.
   Design/Method We conducted 103 semi-structured interviews with students
   in a multidisciplinary service-learning program. To capture how ethical
   decision-making unfolded over time, we sampled 13 students who had
   participated for multiple semesters on the same projects. The resulting
   30 interviews were transcribed, coded, and thematically analyzed. We
   then explicated when and how students appeared to grapple with the
   ethical principles of beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and
   justice.
   Results The findings trace which ethical principles emerged as salient
   in each phase of the design process as well as what conditions and
   activities stimulated students' reflection on their ethical
   decision-making.
   Conclusions Although certain phases of the design process appear to
   prompt consideration of specific principles, students' interactions with
   users and project partners appeared to stimulate the most reflection on
   their ethical decision-making. We discuss how educators can leverage
   these and other reflection triggers to better structure and support
   students' ethical reasoning as well as strategies for making intuitive
   processes more explicit.},

Title = {Creating and disseminating coach education policy: a case of formal
   coach education in grassroots football},
Journal = {SPORT EDUCATION AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},

Pages = {917-930},
Month = {OCT 13},
Abstract = {By examining on-course pedagogical practices, recent research has sought
   to inform the development of National Governing Body (NGB) coach
   education courses. Coach education programmes are, however, social
   constructs, and are influenced by policies and socio-economic factors.
   To inform future provision, there is a need to understand the
   construction of policy and the influences affecting course design. This
   study examined how the English Football Association (FA) redeveloped
   their coach education policy in 2016. The 2016 changes are pertinent
   because calls for educational provision to be informed by social
   constructivism have been made. The FA's coach education policy (2016)
   claim to be informed by such a philosophical stance. This study,
   therefore, reports onwhatpolicy was created, andhowit had been
   disseminated within the organisation. Twenty-eight interviews were
   conducted with 14 participants (staff members with different roles
   within the FA) across two separate points in time, 12 months apart. A
   thematic analysis identified three key themes: (1) Three Elements of
   Curriculum/Course Design (A learning strategy informed by social
   constructivism; a body of content for courses; a coaching competency
   framework and qualification specification); (2) Recontextualisation of
   the policy and some confusion during dissemination; and (3) A restricted
   code when disseminating policy. The significance of these findings
   extends beyond the case presented and policy makers who seek to inform
   course design with learning theory may wish to offer elaboration
   throughout the workforce via text and discourse. Future research should
   build on these findings and consider how knowledge is selected and
   legitimised by policy makers, and how coach developers implement
   recontextualised policies.},

Abstract = {Educational robotics (ER) is an innovative learning tool that offers
   students opportunities to develop higher-order thinking skills. This
   study investigates the development of students' metacognitive (MC) and
   problem-solving (PS) skills in the context of ER activities,
   implementing different modes of guidance in two student groups (11-12
   years old, N1 = 30, and 15-16 years old, N2 = 22). The students of each
   age group were involved in an 18-h group-based activity after being
   randomly distributed in two conditions: ``minimal{''} (with minimal MC
   and PS guidance) and ``strong{''} (with strong MC and PS guidance).
   Evaluations were based on the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory
   measuring students' metacognitive awareness and on a think-aloud
   protocol asking students to describe the process they would follow to
   solve a certain robot-programming task. The results suggest that (a)
   strong guidance in solving problems can have a positive impact on
   students' MC and PS skills and (b) students reach eventually the same
   level of MC and PS skills development independently of their age and
   gender.},

Title = {The Implicit/Explicit Continuum of Life Skills Development and Transfer},
Journal = {QUEST},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {70},
Number = {4},
Pages = {456-470},
Abstract = {There is an ongoing discussion as to how life skills development and
   transfer should be addressed. Previously, researchers have proposed an
   implicit/explicit dichotomy to explain how life skills teaching occurs.
   As research within the area of sport-based youth development continues
   to progress, a model is needed to delineate the varying levels of
   implicitness/explicitness at which coaches can facilitate life skills
   development and transfer. Within this article, an implicit/explicit
   continuum of life skills development and transfer is presented and
   distributed across six levels: (a) structuring the sport context, (b)
   facilitating a positive climate, (c) discussing life skills, (d)
   practicing life skills, (e) discussing transfer, and (f) practicing
   transfer. The levels found within the continuum are grounded in existing
   sport psychology literature. Conceptually, researchers can use the
   continuum to empirically situate how coaches teach life skills.
   Practically, the continuum can help coaches frame their approach to life
   skills development and transfer.},

Abstract = {The nursing educational process may contribute to stress in nursing
   students, particularly during clinical rotations. This descriptive study
   explored the relationships between perceived stress, coping behaviors,
   personality traits, and physio-psycho-social responses in a clinical
   practicum among baccalaureate nursing students and identified predictors
   for physio-psycho-social responses. A cross-sectional design was
   employed. One hundred and one juniors enrolled in a four-year
   baccalaureate nursing program in Taiwan participated in this study. Four
   structured questionnaires were utilized to collect data. Multiple
   regression analysis showed that three predictors accounted for 53.2\% of
   the variance in students' physio-psycho-social responses, including
   perceived stress, students' gender, and personality traits. The
   implication for nursing educators is providing immediate assistance and
   appropriate support to guide students through difficult learning when
   they need. Nursing instructors also should pay attention to students'
   gender-linked differences and be aware of individuals' personality
   traits, especially those with emotional instability, unsocial behaviors,
   and depressive signs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Do coursework summative assessments predict clinical performance? A
   systematic review},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {FEB 16},
Abstract = {Background: Two goals of summative assessment in health profession
   education programs are to ensure the robustness of high stakes decisions
   such as progression and licensing, and predict future performance. This
   systematic and critical review aims to investigate the ability of
   specific modes of summative assessment to predict the clinical
   performance of health profession education students.
   Methods: PubMed, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, ERIC and EMBASE databases were
   searched using key terms with articles collected subjected to dedicated
   inclusion criteria. Rigorous exclusion criteria were applied to ensure a
   consistent interpretation of `summative assessment' and `clinical
   performance'. Data were extracted using a pre-determined format and
   papers were critically appraised by two independent reviewers using a
   modified Downs and Black checklist with level of agreement between
   reviewers determined through a Kappa analysis.
   Results: Of the 4783 studies retrieved from the search strategy, 18
   studies were included in the final review. Twelve were from the medical
   profession and there was one from each of physiotherapy, pharmacy,
   dietetics, speech pathology, dentistry and dental hygiene. Objective
   Structured Clinical Examinations featured in 15 papers, written
   assessments in four and problem based learning evaluations, case based
   learning evaluations and student portfolios each featured in one paper.
   Sixteen different measures of clinical performance were used. Two papers
   were identified as `poor' quality and the remainder categorised as
   `fair' with an almost perfect (k = 0.852) level of agreement between
   raters. Objective Structured Clinical Examination scores accounted for
   1.4-39.7\% of the variance in student performance; multiple
   choice/extended matching questions and short answer written examinations
   accounted for 3.2-29.2\%; problem based or case based learning
   evaluations accounted for 4.4-16.6\%; and student portfolios accounted
   for 12.1\%.
   Conclusions: Objective structured clinical examinations and written
   examinations consisting of multiple choice/extended matching questions
   and short answer questions do have significant relationships with the
   clinical performance of health professional students. However, caution
   should be applied if using these assessments as predictive measures for
   clinical performance due to a small body of evidence and large
   variations in the predictive strength of the relationships identified.
   Based on the current evidence, the Objective Structured Clinical
   Examination may be the most appropriate summative assessment for
   educators to use to identify students that may be at risk of poor
   performance in a clinical workplace environment. Further research on
   this topic is needed to improve the strength of the predictive
   relationship.},

Abstract = {This article highlights the importance of considering Cog-nitive Load
   (CL) and Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) during surgical training, focusing
   on the acquisition of intra-oper-ative skills. It describes the basis of
   CLT with the over-arching aim of describing CLT-based techniques to
   enhance current training strategies and surgical perfor-mance, many of
   which are instinctively already employed in surgical practice.
   Currently, methods of feedback and assessment are imperfect -typically
   subjective, unsystem-atic, opportunistic, or retrospective, and at risk
   of human bias. Surgical Sabermetrics, the advanced analytics of
   sur-gical and audio-visual data, aims to enhance this feedback by
   providing objective, real-time, digital-based feedback. This article
   introduces the benefit of real-time measure-ment of CL to enhance
   feedback and its applications to surgical performance that follow the
   ethos of Surgical Sabermetrics.1 The 2022 theme for ICOSET was ``Making
   it Better.{''} Cognitive Load and Surgical Sabermetrics prin-ciples
   provide tools to make Surgical training better, with the goal of higher
   quality care for patients. ( J Surg Ed 80:311-322.(c) 2022 The

Abstract = {Low attendance levels in medical appointments have been associated with
   poor health outcomes and efficiency problems for service providers. To
   address this problem, healthcare managers could aim at improving
   attendance levels or minimizing the operational impact of no-shows by
   adapting resource allocation policies. However, given the uncertainty of
   patient behaviour, generating relevant information regarding no-show
   probabilities could support the decision-making process for both
   approaches. In this context many researchers have used multiple
   regression models to identify patient and appointment characteristics
   than can be used as good predictors for no-show probabilities. This work
   develops a Decision Support System (DSS) to support the implementation
   of strategies to encourage attendance, for a preventive care program
   targeted at underserved communities in Bogota, Colombia. Our
   contribution to literature is threefold. Firstly, we assess the
   effectiveness of different machine learning approaches to improve the
   accuracy of regression models. In particular, Random Forest and Neural
   Networks are used to model the problem accounting for non-linearity and
   variable interactions. Secondly, we propose a novel use of Layer-wise
   Relevance Propagation in order to improve the explainability of neural
   network predictions and obtain insights from the modelling step.
   Thirdly, we identify variables explaining no-show probabilities in a
   developing context and study its policy implications and potential for
   improving healthcare access. In addition to quantifying relationships
   reported in previous studies, we find that income and neighbourhood
   crime statistics affect no-show probabilities. Our results will support
   patient prioritization in a pilot behavioural intervention and will
   inform appointment planning decisions.},

Abstract = {The number of adult cancer survivors in the USA is expected to double by
   the year 2050. A call for increased survivorship care and provider
   training came from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in the form of a
   landmark report in 2006. A shortage of physicians complicates the burden
   of survivorship care. The purpose of this effort was to design, develop,
   and evaluate a fully accredited, evidence-based continuing medical
   education (CME) and continuing education (CE) intervention to address
   the established knowledge gap for breast cancer, prostate cancer,
   colorectal cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma survivorship education.
   Delivered through the Medscape Education (WebMD) platform, the course
   covered epidemiology, survivor issues, and currently available
   guidelines using illustrative patient cases. Knowledge gain was
   evaluated using a pretest-posttest design. Program evaluation was
   assessed by survey. Additional areas examined included post-intervention
   inquiry regarding expected changes to clinical practice. The results of
   this educational intervention demonstrated the effectiveness of
   internet-based CME/CE for cancer survivorship. Learning gain was
   significant (p < 0.0005). Effect size (d = 1.71) suggested extremely
   high practical significance, as the difference between the means was
   larger than 1 standard deviation. Significant knowledge gains were
   observed for each survivorship knowledge question across all clinical
   specialties studied. Nearly 100 \% of participants agreed that the
   course contributed to survivorship care and was organized effectively.
   Participants reported that the course was designed effectively (97.2
   \%), and 68.1 \% responded in favor of adopting alternative
   communication strategies with patients and families upon completion of
   the course.},

Title = {A Middle Game Search Algorithm Applicable to Low-Cost Personal Computer
   for Go},

Abstract = {Go Artificial Intellects(AIs) using deep reinforcement learning and
   neural networks have achieved superhuman performance, but they rely on
   powerful computing resources. They are not applicable to low-cost
   personal computer(PC). In our life, most entertainment programs of Go
   run on the general PC. A human Go master consider different strategies
   for different stages, especially for the middle stage that has a
   significant impact on winning or losing. To study arguably a more
   humanlike approach that is applicable to low-cost PC while not reducing
   chess power, this paper proposes a new search algorithm based on
   hypothesis testing and dynamic randomization for the middle stage of the
   game Go. Firstly, a new method to decide the intervals of different
   playing stages more reasonable based on hypothesis testing is proposed.
   Secondly, a new search algorithm including a layered pruning branch
   method, a comprehensive evaluation function and a new selecting node
   method is proposed. The pruning method based on domain knowledge and
   upper confidence bound formula(UCB) are all applied to subtract the
   branches from the lower evaluation score, which was ranked behind 20\%.
   The comprehensive evaluation function with adjustable parameters is
   proposed to evaluate the tree nodes after pruning. The new selecting
   node method based on dynamic randomization is used to expand the tree by
   selecting a node randomly from the high-quality node interval. Finally,
   the experimental results show that the designed algorithm outperforms
   Gnugo3.6 and Gnugo3.8 in chess power while reducing average search time
   and average RAM cost for one move effectively on a 19 x 19 board.},

Title = {Accurate Uncalibrated Rectification Using Feature Matching Re-Selection},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {142156-142167},
Abstract = {Rectification is a core programming process that involves multiple
   views. In this study, we focus on uncalibrated cases that neglect
   intrinsic and extrinsic camera information. Existing uncalibrated
   rectification methods use feature-matching techniques to form
   relationships between different views and use those features to estimate
   optimized homography matrices. However, outliers are inevitable in
   feature matching. Using these outliers in a rectification process
   produces vertical disparity errors and unwanted geometric distortion. To
   tackle the problem, we propose a novel method that can learn from the
   rectification results, re-select the matching pairs, and find superior
   solutions. The proposed method introduces a novel workflow for
   uncalibrated rectification that incorporates three cores: field of view
   (FoV) neutralization, rectification, and feature matching re-selection
   (FMR). While the FoV neutralization module handles FoV differences among
   views, a combination of the rectification module and FMR module results
   in the optimal homography matrices. The rectification module takes
   neutral correspondences and estimates the optimized rectified matrices.
   Applying the results from the rectification module, the FMR module
   optimizes the correspondences and return them to the rectification
   module. For the rectification module, we apply adaptive geometric
   constraints and our updated optimization strategy to secure satisfied
   vertical disparity errors while maintaining low distortion levels.
   Multidisciplinary experiments are performed to analyze the capabilities
   of the proposed method. We combine existing datasets with extra samples,
   including various outdoor environments, to gauge the performance better.
   Compared with existing methods, the proposed method produces fewer
   rectification errors and keeps the rectified images under low distortion
   rates.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel clustering method with feature
   selection in a synchronized manner, called iterative tighter nonparallel
   support vector clustering with simultaneous feature selection
   (IT-NHSVC-SFS). A certain iterative (alternating) optimization strategy
   for clustering is applied to a learning model with twin hyperplanes, in
   which two types of regularizers, namely the Euclidean and infinite
   norms, are introduced to achieve the enhancement of clustering
   generalization performance and coordinated feature selection. The
   L-infinite norm actually conducts implicit feature elimination process
   to reduce clustering noises resulting from irrelevant features, thus
   guaranteeing clustering accuracy. Meanwhile, since the formulation of
   the proposed model embodies the large-margin spirit,good generalization
   can also be ensured. Unlike twin support vector machine and its
   variants, nonparallel hyperplane SVM (NHSVM) is chosen to be a baseline
   model,thus only a single quadratic programming problem is needed to
   solve for the optimal twin hyperplanes, making it convenient to design a
   synchronized feature selection process in two hyperplanes. Additionally,
   two more groups of equality constraints are enforced into the original
   constraint set of NHSVM, thus the inverse operation of two large
   matrices can be avoided to reduce the computational complexity.
   Furthermore,the hinge loss function of NHSVM is replaced by the
   Laplacian loss measure to prevent the premature convergence. Numerical
   experiments are performed on benchmark datasets to investigate the
   validity of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results indicate
   that IT-NHSVC-SFS has better performance than other existing clustering
   methods mainly in terms of clustering accuracy.},

Title = {Rehabilitation healthcare professionals' competence and confidence in
   differentially diagnosing deafblindness from autism spectrum disorders:
   a cross-sectional survey in South Africa},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Background Early diagnosis and management of children who are deafblind
   is important to alleviate the effects of deafblindness on the
   development of the child who is deafblind and their families. However,
   children who are deafblind are often misdiagnosed or diagnosed late. The
   misdiagnosis or late diagnosis has been attributed to many factors, one
   of which is the competence and confidence of healthcare professionals in
   differentially diagnosing deafblindness from other conditions, in most
   cases, autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study therefore aimed to
   establish the competence and confidence of rehabilitation healthcare
   professionals in differentially diagnosing deafblindness from ASD in the
   South African context. Methods A cross-sectional survey design was
   employed for the study. An online questionnaire was distributed to
   rehabilitation healthcare professionals (N = 78) via Survey Monkey. Data
   were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Ethical
   clearance and permission were obtained from relevant stakeholders prior
   to the commencement of the study. Results Regarding the rehabilitation
   healthcare professionals in this study, 54\% were competent in
   diagnosing ASD, while only 35\% could correctly diagnose deafblindness.
   In some instances, symptoms were classified as associated with both ASD
   and deafblindness, when they were just those of deafblindness. Of all
   the rehabilitation healthcare professionals in this study, speech
   language therapists displayed the most knowledge of deafblindness.
   Furthermore, healthcare professionals who had between one and nine years
   of working experience had more knowledge of deafblindness than other
   professionals with more or less experience. Conclusion Deafblindness is
   often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed as ASD. This is due to the lack of
   competence and confidence of rehabilitation healthcare professionals in
   diagnosing it. The findings therefore highlight the need for training of
   rehabilitation healthcare professionals. Training on deafblindness could
   be included as part of the curriculum in the various undergraduate
   programs. Deafblindness could also form part of the Continuous
   Professional Development (CPD) training programs at various healthcare
   facilities. A team approach to the training would be ideal as it would
   facilitate peer learning and support. More research is required as it
   would inform evidence-based assessment, and management and support
   strategies for children who are deafblind and their families.},

Title = {Objective Assessment of the Entrustable Professional Activity Handover
   in Undergraduate and Postgraduate Surgical Learners},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {76},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1258-1266},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study used a virtual patient simulation (VPS) to
   quantifiably and objectively assess undergraduate (UG) to postgraduate
   (PG) medical learners' acquisition of the entrustable professional
   activity (EPA) ``handover,{''} focusing particularly on the transition
   to residency. This EPA is critical because it is part of a core
   competency for UG and PG training in both the United States and Canada,
   and is essential for patient safety and comprehensive professional
   communication.
   DESIGN: Data were collected from 3 separate groups of participants: 2 UG
   cohorts from an earlier study, as well as a PG cohort at the beginning
   of residency. All participants completed the same trauma VPS, which
   required a free text summary statement that was used as a surrogate for
   an oral handover. These were collected and scored independently, using
   previously developed validated rubrics, one procedural and the second
   semantic.
   SETTING: All study participants were from one site. The VPS case was
   completed online.
   PARTICIPANTS: Two different UG groups, one designated junior (N = 52),
   was studied at the beginning of their clerkship year, a second group,
   designated senior (N = 30), was studied at the end of their clerkship
   year. These groups were compared to a third group of PG learners (N =
   31) during the initial 2 weeks of their residency. Informed consent was
   obtained from all participants.
   RESULTS: A procedural rubric assessed learners' cognitive knowledge of
   trauma care-management. A semantic rubric assessed their use of the
   professional language necessary for a safe and succinct clinical
   handover communication. An Analysis of Variance comparing scores on the
   procedural rubric was highly significant with Tukey LSD tests indicating
   that all 3 groups were significantly different. Students increased their
   scores on the procedural rubric at each stage of their training. A
   parallel Analysis of Variance comparing students' scores on the semantic
   rubric revealed no significant increase in scores, indicating that
   students did not improve in their capacity to communicate professionally
   as they progressed through their training.
   CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results demonstrate that training was
   successful in teaching cognitive-based procedures, but not effective in
   teaching professional communication, which is critical to the EPA
   handover. Greater emphasis needs to be placed on ensuring the
   acquisition of professional communication skills throughout the
   continuum of UG and PG clinical activities. Faculty development should
   serve as a support to assist medical educators to address this
   requirement. These results also demonstrate that VPS with associated
   objective and validated rubrics can be used as an assessment methodology
   to quantifiably measure learner performance with respect to the EPA
   handover. A similar strategy should be considered across the UG and PG
   continuum for other EPAs and could form the nexus for further research.

Title = {EPAW-1.0 code for evolutionary optimization of PAW datasets especially
   for high-pressure applications},
Journal = {COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {233},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We present a bio-inspired stochastic optimization strategy that
   optimizes projector augmented wave (PAW) datasets, for a user-specified
   pressure range, to realize the highest possible accuracy in
   high-throughput density functional theory calculations within the
   framework of PAW method. We named the optimizer ``Evolutionary Generator
   of projector augmented wave datasets{''} (EPAW-1.0). The self-learning
   evolutionary algorithms in EPAW-1.0 adaptively tune some of the PAW
   parameters (such as different radii, and reference energies) to generate
   evolutionary optimized PAW (EPAW) datasets. In the course of designing
   EPAW dataset with a specific pseudo partial waves and projectors
   generation scheme, the code keeps the user-specified electronic
   configuration unaltered and the augmentation radius (r(c)) on the verge
   of the user allowed maximum without resulting in sphere overlap. The
   EPAW-1.0 algorithm homes on to a soft, transferable and unified EPAW
   dataset using various measures including the equation of state (EoS) of
   standard elemental materials within a user-specified pressure range that
   allows probing similar to 50\% volume compression with respect to the
   equilibrium atomic volume (corresponding to the energy minimum). The
   measures used by the EPAW algorithm also can be used to balance the
   efficiency and accuracy of the dataset.

   Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License 3 (GPLv3)
   Programming languages: Fortran90, Fortran77, Python3.0, bash shell,

   External routines/libraries: ATOMPAW, Quantum ESPRESSO, related linear
   algebra package.
   Nature of problem: EPAW-1.0 is a hybrid recipe {[}2] that documents an
   interdisciplinary research integrating evolutionary computing with
   density functional theory (DFT). It offers a partially automated and
   consistent route to generate evolutionary optimized PAW (EPAW) datasets
   that show uniform performance for simulations up to a predefined high
   pressure. In particular, EPAW-1.0 makes use of evolutionary algorithms
   {[}3-7], PAW dataset generator (ATOMPAW {[}8], for example) and
   electronics-tructure calculation code (Quantum Espresso {[}9], for
   example) to generate efficient and transferable EPAW datasets. EPAW
   datasets provide optimal accuracy in solid-state ab initio calculations
   within the favorable PAW computational framework - very close to the
   precision of targeted all-electron full potential linearized
   Augmented-plane-wave (AE-FLAPW) approach. We set the EoS from WIEN2k
   {[}1] calculations as our target, but any reliable EoS can be in use.
   The better the target EoS, the better is the performance of the EPAW
   datasets. Similarly, electronic-structure calculation code and PAW
   dataset generator code can also be replaced.
   Solution Method: The implementation has two parts: a. Generating a
   diverse random initial population for EPAW-1.0 to start with; b.
   Generating EPAW dataset using EPAW-1.0.
   A hybrid method, combining an in-house evolutionary strategy named
   Completely Adaptive Random Mutation Hill Climbing {[}6] (CARMHC) with
   ATOMPAW {[}8] program, quickly optimizes a set (population) of n oon
   solutions (PAW dataset descriptors) from which the iterative process of
   EPAW-1.0 starts. The optimization condition involves superimposing the
   logarithmic derivative curves of the all-electron and pseudo radial wave
   functions, simultaneously satisfying necessary constraints on
   logarithmic derivatives, partial waves, pseudo partial waves and
   projector basis sets {[}2,8,10-12]. To start with, the method generates
   a diverse initial population of n(pop) solution vector (n(pop) =
   cardinality of the GA's population in EPAW-1.0) randomly in the
   neighborhood of the initial educated guess based on problem-specific
   knowledge from the ATOMPAW program and iteratively tunes the population
   to minimize the area under the logarithmic derivative curves.
   Once n(pop) number of solution strings have been optimized, n pop
   individuals are feed into the EPAW1.0's initial population. Equilibrium
   total energies are evaluated using Quantum Espresso distribution {[}9]
   and fitted to a finite strain expansion. Pressures are calculated using
   a 4-parameter Birch-Murnaghan fit {[}13,14 EPAW-1.0 employs genetic
   algorithms (GAs) {[}15-19] as the evolutionary procedure and iteratively
   tunes the free parameters of the PAW dataset generator to minimize the
   difference in equation of states (EoS) with respect to the given target
   EoS for the specified pressure range.
   Additional comments: EPAW-1.0 is an evolutionary procedure blended with
   external density functional theory (DFT) formalism (as implemented in
   ATOMPAW and Quantum Espresso, for example). The ATOMPAW code generates
   dataset by a self-consistent all-electron atomic structure calculation
   within the framework of DFT. The projector and basis functions are
   derived from the eigenstates of the all-electron atomic Hamiltonian.
   They are determined by iteratively solving radial differential
   equations. Equilibrium total energies at some equidistant volume points
   for a specific elemental crystal are evaluated using Quantum Espresso
   distribution {[}9]. The EPAW-1.0 program conserves different constraints
   {[}2] on logarithmic derivatives and basis sets to avoid numerical
   instability, ghost states, and to promote an excellent transferability.
   More details about the constraints can be found in the methodology part
   of reference 1. It also provides a goodness measure of the generated
   dataset concerning the targeted results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {The effect of written standardized feedback on the structure and quality
   of surgical lectures: A prospective cohort study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Month = {NOV 14},
Abstract = {Background: Lectures remain an important teaching method to present and
   structure knowledge to many students concurrently. Adequate measures are
   necessary to maintain the quality of the lectures. The aim of this study
   was to determine the impact on the lecture quality using written
   structured feedback and to compare the ratings of surgical lectures
   between students and surgical peers.
   Methods: Prospective analysis of two consecutive surgical lecture series
   for undergraduate students at Goethe-University Medical School was
   performed before and after evaluation of the lecturers via independent
   written feedback from trained undergraduate students and surgeons. The
   22-item feedback instrument covered three areas of performance: content,
   visualization, and delivery. Additional suggestions for improvement were
   provided from both students and surgical peers who anonymously attended
   the lectures. The lecturers, experienced surgeons, as well as the
   student and peer raters were blinded in terms of the aim and content of
   the study. Their response to the feedback was collected using a
   web-based 13-item questionnaire. The Kendall's-W coefficient was
   computed to calculate inter-rater reliability (IRR). Differences between
   ratings before and after feedback were analyzed using Student's t-test
   for dependent samples. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test was used for
   independent samples.
   Results: A total of 22 lectures from a possible 32 given by 13 lecturers
   were included and analyzed by at least three surgeons and two students.
   There were significant improvements in overall score as well as in the
   details of 9 of the 13 items were found. The average inter-rater
   reliability was 0.71. There were no differences in the ratings as a
   function of the rater's level of expertise (peers vs. students). We
   found that 13/ 23 lecturers (56.5\%) answered the questionnaire, and
   92\% strongly agreed that the written feedback was useful. 76.9\% of the
   lecturers revised their lecture based on the written feedback requiring
   on average 112.5 min (range from 20 to 300 min).
   Conclusions: Overall, this study indicates that structured written
   feedback provided by trained peers and students that is subsequently
   discussed by the lecturers concerned is a highly effective and efficient
   method to improve aspects of lecturing. We anticipate that structured
   written feedback by trained students that is discussed by the lecturers
   concerned will improve lecturing.},

Abstract = {Supervision matters: it serves educational, supportive and management
   functions. Despite a plethora of evidence on the effectiveness of
   supervision, scant evidence for the impact of supervision training
   exists. While three previous literature reviews have begun to examine
   the effectiveness of supervision training, they fail to explore the
   extent to which supervision training works, for whom, and why. We
   adopted a realist approach to answer the question: to what extent do
   supervision training interventions work (or not), for whom and in what
   circumstances, and why? We conducted a team-based realist synthesis of
   the supervision training literature focusing on Pawson's five stages:
   (1) clarifying the scope; (2) determining the search strategy; (3) study
   selection; (4) data extraction; and (5) data synthesis. We extracted
   contexts (C), mechanisms (M) and outcomes (O) and CMO configurations
   from 29 outputs including short (n = 19) and extended-duration (n = 10)
   supervision training interventions. Irrespective of duration,
   interventions including mixed pedagogies involving active and/or
   experiential learning, social learning and protected time served as
   mechanisms triggering multiple positive supervisor outcomes.
   Short-duration interventions also led to positive outcomes through
   mechanisms such as supervisor characteristics, whereas facilitator
   characteristics was a key mechanism triggering positive and negative
   outcomes for extended-duration interventions. Disciplinary and
   organisational contexts were not especially influential. While our
   realist synthesis builds on previous non-realist literature reviews, our
   findings extend previous work considerably. Our realist synthesis
   presents a broader array of outcomes and mechanisms than have been
   previously identified, and provides novel insights into the causal
   pathways in which short and extended-duration supervision training
   interventions produce their effects. Future realist evaluation should
   explore further any differences between short and extended-duration
   interventions. Educators are encouraged to prioritize mixed pedagogies,
   social learning and protected time to maximize the positive supervisor
   outcomes from training.},

Abstract = {Issue Harassment is a common experience for medical and healthcare
   trainees. Experiencing harassment can have significant consequences for
   trainees in multiple domains, including mental, physical, social, and
   occupational well-being. Harassment remains entrenched in medical
   education despite efforts to address it. Evidence: Many articles have
   documented the prevalence of harassment in medical education. Likewise,
   articles have provided recommendations for how individuals or hospitals
   can attempt to reduce harassment. However, despite calls for reform,
   harassment persists, largely due to the hierarchical, paternalistic,
   high-pressure, and evaluative nature of medical culture. Most literature
   has emphasized the need for policies and reporting structures, yet such
   top-down initiatives have not had a sufficient impact on the attitudes
   and beliefs that drive culture change. Instead, change requires
   intervention at every level of an organization. Little, if any,
   literature has proposed applying a change management model to change the
   culture of medical training and therefore decrease harassment.
   Implications: This paper applies principles of organizational change
   theory, and in particular, the ADKAR model, in conjunction with a
   summary of the existing harassment literature, to propose a framework
   for addressing harassment by facilitating organizational culture change.
   Intervention is needed at all levels of the medical education system
   (the healthcare system, the supervisor or training program, and the
   individual), and the ADKAR framework can guide what interventions are
   offered and when to capitalize on the current level of change readiness.
   Recommendations go beyond the typical focus on formalized policies and
   procedures, which are necessary, but not sufficient, components of
   culture change. Implementation of these practices, as well as ongoing
   evaluation and refinement through research, should foster cultural
   change in medical education to address harassment.},

Title = {Personalized and object-centered tag recommendation methods for Web 2.0
   applications},

Abstract = {Several Web 2.0 applications allow users to assign keywords (or tags) to
   provide better organization and description of the shared content. Tag
   recommendation methods may assist users in this task, improving the
   quality of the available information and, thus, the effectiveness of
   various tag-based information retrieval services, such as searching,
   content recommendation and classification. This work addresses the tag
   recommendation problem from two perspectives. The first perspective,
   centered at the object, aims at suggesting relevant tags to a target
   object, jointly exploiting the following three dimensions: (i) tag
   cooccurrences, (ii) terms extracted from multiple textual features
   (e.g., title, description), and (iii) various metrics to estimate tag
   relevance. The second perspective, centered at both object and user,
   aims at performing personalized tag recommendation to a target
   objectuser pair, exploiting, in addition to the three aforementioned
   dimensions, a metric that captures user interests.
   In particular, we propose new heuristic methods that extend
   state-of-the-art strategies by including new metrics that estimate how
   accurately a candidate tag describes the target object. We also exploit
   three learning-to-rank (L2R) based techniques, namely, RankSVM, Genetic
   Programming (GP) and Random Forest (RF), for generating ranking
   functions that exploit multiple metrics as attributes to estimate the
   relevance of a tag to a given object or object-user pair. We evaluate
   the proposed methods using data from four popular Web 2.0 applications,
   namely, Bibsonomy, LastFM, YouTube and YahooVideo. Our new heuristics
   for object-centered tag recommendation provide improvements in precision
   over the best state-of-the-art alternative of 12\% on average (up to
   20\% in any single dataset), while our new heuristics for personalized
   tag recommendation produce average gains in precision of 121\% over the
   baseline. Similar performance gains are also achieved in terms of other
   metrics, notably recall, Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
   and Mean-Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Further improvements, for both
   object-centered (up to 23\% in precision) and personalized tag
   recommendation (up to 13\% in precision), can also be achieved with our
   new L2R-based strategies, which are flexible and can be easily extended
   to exploit other aspects of the tag recommendation problem. Finally, we
   also quantify the benefits of personalized tag recommendation to provide
   better descriptions of the target object when compared to
   object-centered recommendation by focusing only on the relevance of the
   suggested tags to the object. We find that our best personalized method
   outperforms the best object-centered strategy, with average gains in
   precision of 10\%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Predicting Customer Turnover Using Recursive Neural Networks},

Abstract = {The most valuable asset for a company is its customers' base. As a
   result, customer relationship management (CRM) is an important task that
   drives companies. By identifying and understanding the valuable customer
   segments, appropriate marketing strategies can be used to enhance
   customer satisfaction and maintain loyalty, as well as increase company
   retention. Predicting customer turnover is an important tool for
   companies to stay competitive in a fast-growing market. In this paper,
   we use the recurrent nerve sketch to predict rejection based on the time
   series of the lifetime of the customer. In anticipation, a key aspect of
   identifying key triggers is to turn off. To overcome the weakness of
   recurrent neural networks, the research model of the combination of
   LRFMP with the neural network has been used. In this paper, it was found
   that clustering by LRFMP can be used to perform a more comprehensive
   analysis of customers' turnover. In this solution, LRFMP is used to
   execute customer segregation. The objective is to provide a new
   framework for LRFMP for macrodata and macrodata analysis in order to
   increase the problem of business problem solving and customer
   depreciation. The results of the research show that the neural networks
   are capable of predicting the LRFMP precursors of the customers in an
   effective way. This model can be used in advocacy systems for
   advertising and loyalty programs management. In the previous research,
   the LRFM and RFM algorithms along with the neural network and the
   machine learning algorithm, etc., have been used, and in the proposed
   solution, the use of the LRFMP algorithm increases the accuracy of the
   desired.},

Title = {A collaborative variable neighborhood descent algorithm for the hybrid
   flowshop scheduling problem with consistent sublots},
Journal = {APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {106},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Lot streaming is the most widely used technique of supporting the
   overlap of consecutive operations. Inspired by the real-world scenarios,
   this paper introduces this issue into the hybrid flowshop scheduling
   problem with consistent sublots (HFSP\_CS). The innovations of this
   paper lie in developing a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model,
   and in developing a collaborative variable neighborhood descent
   algorithm (CVND). The CVND evolves with a primary solution and an
   archive set comprising of promising solutions found in the progress, and
   contains four processes including the VND process, collaborative
   process, archive set and primary solution restart processes.
   Accordingly, the primary solution conducts the VND process with the
   defined neighborhood structures to implement the local exploitation. The
   archive set executes the collaborative process to learn from the
   historical information to implement the global search. The archive set
   restart is triggered when it is stuck into the local optima. The primary
   solution restart aims to conduct a large perturbation on the primary
   solution for the following loop of VND process. Regarding the
   problem-specific characteristics, the solution encoding and decoding are
   designed and an improvement strategy is developed to further improve the
   solution quality. To validate the CVND, two sets of instances are
   collected. Through comparing with the CPLEX solver, a heuristic and five
   state-of-the-art metaheuristics on small instances, the CVND shows the
   most suitable performance in terms of the objective values and algorithm
   efficiency. Through comparing with the heuristic and metaheuristics on
   medium-large instances, the CVND performs statistically better in terms
   of the relative percentage deviation values. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {We define a prescriptive analytics framework that addresses the needs of
   a constrained decision-maker facing, ex ante, unknown costs and benefits
   of multiple policy levers. The framework is general in nature and can be
   deployed in any utility-maximizing context, public or private. It relies
   on randomized field experiments for causal inference, machine learning
   for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, and on the optimization
   of an integer linear program for converting predictions into decisions.
   The net result is the discovery of individual-level targeting of policy
   interventions to maximize overall utility under a budget constraint. The
   framework is set in the context of the four pillars of analytics and is
   especially valuable for companies that already have an existing practice
   of running A/B tests. The key contribution of this work is to develop
   and operationalize a framework to exploit both within-and
   between-treatment arm heterogeneity in the utility response function in
   order to derive benefits from future (optimized) prescriptions. We
   demonstrate the value of this framework as compared to benchmark
   practices-i.e., the use of the average treatment effect, uplift
   modeling, as well as an extension to contextual bandits-in two different
   settings. Unlike these standard approaches, our framework is able to
   recognize, adapt to, and exploit the (potential) presence of different
   subpopulations that experience varying costs and benefits within a
   treatment arm while also exhibiting differential costs and benefits
   across treatment arms. As a result, we find a targeting strategy that
   produces an order of magnitude improvement in expected total utility for
   the case where significant within-and between-treatment arm
   heterogeneity exists.},

Title = {Lorenzetti Showers- A general-purpose framework for supporting signal
   reconstruction and triggering with calorimeters},
Journal = {COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {286},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Calorimeters play an important role in high-energy physics experiments.
   Their design includes electronic instrumentation, signal processing
   chain, computing infrastructure, and also a good understanding of their
   response to particle showers produced by the interaction of incoming
   particles. This is usually supported by full simulation frameworks
   developed for specific experiments so that their access is restricted to
   the collaboration members only. Such restrictions limit the
   general-purpose developments that aim to propose innovative approaches
   to signal processing, which may include machine learning and advanced
   stochastic signal processing models. This work presents the Lorenzetti
   Showers, a general-purpose framework that mainly targets supporting
   novel signal reconstruction and triggering strategies using segmented
   calorimeter information. This framework fully incorporates developments
   down to the signal processing chain level (signal shaping, energy
   estimation, and noise mitigation techniques) to allow advanced signal
   processing approaches in modern calorimetry and triggering systems. The
   developed framework is flexible enough to be extended in different
   directions. For instance, it can become a tool for the phenomenology
   community to go beyond the usual detector design and physics process
   generation approaches. Program summary Program Title: Lorenzetti Showers

   language: Python, C++. Nature of problem: In experimental high-energy
   physics, simulation is essential for experiment preparation, design and
   interpretations of ongoing acquisitions. Especially for calorimeters, an
   accurate simulation that can describe detector geometry, behavior to
   different physics processes and signal generation close to the readout
   electronics and data acquisition levels is required to properly develop
   signal processing and computational methods. Such detectors may face
   very challenging demands arising from the new designs, such as pileup
   mitigation and noise reduction tasks under unprecedented levels. In this
   sense, simulation requirements continuously increase in complexity and
   performance, because new physics searches require large datasets and
   accurate modeling to experimental effects. Solution method: The
   Lorenzetti Showers is an integrated software framework that provides
   complete calorimeter information close enough to the electronic readout
   chain. Thus, the proposed framework allows users to access cell readout
   values, configurable sensor pulse-shapes, crosstalk modeling, and
   different energy estimation methods. It aims at supporting designs that
   target low or high pileup operation conditions in an easy-to-use modular
   structure. The developed framework is based on Pythia 8 (particle
   generation) and Geant4 (interactions with the calorimeter technique
   under analysis). An efficient data recording structure was used to allow
   full access to the Lorenzetti Showers outputs. In summary, the
   Lorenzetti Showers tool provides to the scientific community a
   user-friendly, flexible, user-oriented, and low-level calorimeter
   simulation framework. Additional comments including restrictions and
   unusual features: The framework current version provides the
   implementation of a generic segmented calorimeter (electromagnetic and
   hadronic sections), which may be modified by the user, if desired.
   It allows the generation of particles interactions using Pythia 8
   (native) or any generator compatible with the HepMC format (which may be
   integrated using an external input file) and propagation through a
   user-configurable calorimeter using Geant4.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {A New Fault Diagnosis Method of Bearings Based on Structural Feature
   Selection},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {By using signal processing and statistical analysis methods
   simultaneously, many heterogeneous features can be produced to describe
   the bearings fault with more comprehensive and discriminant information.
   At same time, there may exist redundant or irrelevant information which
   will instead reduce the diagnosis performance. To solve this problem, it
   is necessary to conduct feature selection which tries to choose the most
   typical and discriminant features by evaluating their effect on fault
   status. However, if the structural relationship between features has not
   been considered well, some similar or redundant features are still
   probably chosen, which would introduce bias into the final diagnosis
   model. In this paper, a new fault diagnosis method of bearings based on
   structural feature selection is proposed to solve the aforementioned
   problem. Obeying the hypothesis that the features with strong
   relatedness have close coefficient distance, the proposed method aims to
   improve diagnosis performance via determining group structure in fault
   features. First, a new feature selection strategy is proposed by
   introducing a group identification matrix. Using this matrix, two
   evaluation criteria about intra-group feature correlation and
   inter-group feature difference are constructed by means of coefficient's
   distance. Consequently, we get a multi-objective 0-1 integer programming
   problem by minimizing intra-group distance and maximizing inter-group
   distance simultaneously. Second, we use the multi-objective particle
   swarm optimization algorithm to solve this problem, and then determine
   the optimal group structure of features adaptively. Finally, a diagnosis
   model can be trained by support vector machine on the typical features
   extracted from these groups. Experimental results on four UCI datasets
   show the effectiveness of the proposed group feature selection strategy.
   Moreover, the experimental results on two bearing datasets (i.e., CWRU
   and IMS datasets) demonstrate that the proposed method can identify the
   inherent group structure in fault features, and then has better
   diagnosis performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods.},

Title = {Medical student perceptions of curricular influences on their wellbeing:
   a qualitative study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 31},
Abstract = {Background Medical student mental health and wellbeing is highly topical
   and the subject of much research. While theoretically informed
   definitions of wellbeing abound, how do medical students themselves
   understand and perceive wellbeing? What aspects of the curriculum do
   they regard as affecting their wellbeing and mental health? This study
   explored these questions, and aimed to identify factors associated with
   student acceptability of wellbeing programs and interventions. Methods
   All students at an Australian undergraduate medical school (n = 619)
   were invited to complete a qualitative online questionnaire between 2017
   and 2018 following the introduction of several wellbeing initiatives,
   including ``Wellbeing Days{''} (WBD). WBD allow students to take single
   absence days for self-care. Open-ended questions were asked about
   perceptions and experience of mental health and wellbeing, and views on
   interventions to improve wellbeing such as WBD. Thematic analysis was
   conducted across all responses. Three authors developed preliminary
   themes, which were then refined and confirmed by all
   researchers.Thematic saturation was achieved within data from the 68
   respondents, which included participants from all cohorts. Results
   Participants described wellbeing as positively experienced work/life
   balance, impacted by four factors; contact hours, peer relationships,
   staff relationships, and trust in how wellbeing initiatives were used.
   Long contact hours were deemed incompatible with self-care activities,
   maintaining employment, and seeking professional medical/psychological
   help. Peers could promote wellbeing by offering social and academic
   support, but also undermine wellbeing by being competitors. Degree of
   trust, engagement and communication with staff influenced acceptability
   of interventions. Participants viewed initiatives such as WBD
   favourably, but distrust of peers, and of staff, led to perceptions that
   WBD could be prone to misuse, or used for surveillance rather than
   support. Conclusion Our findings suggest that wellbeing days which allow
   self-care, reduction in contact hours, and peer support may promote
   student wellbeing, but the acceptability of any interventions is
   influenced by relationships between staff and students, and in
   particular, trust in these relationships. We suggest strategies to
   strengthen trust and further research to investigate the relationship
   between trust and perceptions of wellbeing in self and peers.},

Title = {Achieving robustness to aleatoric uncertainty with heteroscedastic
   Bayesian optimisation},
Journal = {MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},

Abstract = {Bayesian optimisation is a sample-efficient search methodology that
   holds great promise for accelerating drug and materials discovery
   programs. A frequently-overlooked modelling consideration in Bayesian
   optimisation strategies however, is the representation of
   heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainty. In many practical applications it
   is desirable to identify inputs with low aleatoric noise, an example of
   which might be a material composition which displays robust properties
   in response to a noisy fabrication process. In this paper, we propose a
   heteroscedastic Bayesian optimisation scheme capable of representing and
   minimising aleatoric noise across the input space. Our scheme employs a
   heteroscedastic Gaussian process surrogate model in conjunction with two
   straightforward adaptations of existing acquisition functions. First, we
   extend the augmented expected improvement heuristic to the
   heteroscedastic setting and second, we introduce the aleatoric
   noise-penalised expected improvement (ANPEI) heuristic. Both
   methodologies are capable of penalising aleatoric noise in the
   suggestions. In particular, the ANPEI acquisition yields improved
   performance relative to homoscedastic Bayesian optimisation and random
   sampling on toy problems as well as on two real-world scientific
   datasets. Code is available at:

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Working conditions in hospitals generate stress within all
   professional groups. The aim of this study was to find out how German
   medical students during their senior student clerkship in surgery
   perceive their own stress and the stress of surgical residents. This was
   measured using ``Instrument zur stressbezogenen Arbeitsanalyse bei
   KlinikArztInnen (ISAK-K),{''} a validated questionnaire of the German
   statutory occupational accident insurance system (BGW).
   DESIGN AND SETTING: This bi-institutional paper-and pencil survey was
   performed on 52 medical students in their sixth year, who had been
   working in a surgical department for 4 months. Data were compared with
   those of the BGW on the stress perceived by physicians working in German
   surgical departments.
   RESULTS: The stress levels measured with the ISAK-K were similar in
   students and in physicians working in surgery. Students believe that
   surgical residents experience a higher time pressure (p < 0.03). Those
   students planning a surgical career feel to be more exposed to time
   pressure (p < 0.01), but to be more free to decide how to work (p <
   0.03) than their ``nonsurgical{''} colleagues do. In addition, in
   contrast to the ``nonsurgical{''} students, students interested in
   surgery believe that surgical residents have more possibilities to learn
   at work (p < 0.05) and that they can rely on their supervisors (p <
   0.03). All students believe that surgical residents commonly need to
   take decisions without having enough information (p < 0.05). When
   compared with the BGW data students overestimate the stress of surgical
   residents.
   CONCLUSIONS: Students overestimate time pressure and uncertainty of
   surgical residents. A possible way to increase their interest in surgery
   is offering a better insight in surgeons' work and strategies to deal
   with these stressors. ( (C) 2016 Association of Program Directors in

Title = {ELEGANT: Security of Critical Infrastructures With Digital Twins},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {107574-107588},
Abstract = {The past years have witnessed an increasing interest and concern
   regarding the development of security monitoring and management
   mechanisms for Critical Infrastructures, due to their vital role in
   ensuring the availability of many essential services. This task is not
   easy due to the specific characteristics of such systems, and the
   natural resistance of Critical Infrastructures operators against actions
   implying downtime. Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physical
   objects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for security
   analysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployed
   in face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premises
   deployment can be expensive, implying a significant CAPEX whose return
   will depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable support
   infrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable data
   collection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of the
   acquired resources. This paper presents an off-premises approach to
   design and deploy Digital Twins to secure critical infrastructures,
   developed in the scope of the ELEGANT project. Such Digital Twins are
   built using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming Logic
   Controllers, coupled with scalable and efficient data collection
   processes, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learning
   models to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. The
   validation approach of ELEGANT, which leveraged from the capabilities of
   the Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of using
   cloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of the
   projected CAPEX for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-go
   OPEX, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a DTaaS
   (Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm. The achieved results demonstrate
   that the data pipelines providing support for the ELEGANT Digital Twins
   have low impact in terms of resource usage in Denial of Service and
   Distributed Denial of Service attack scenarios, when higher volumes of
   data are generated.},

Title = {Advanced traffic congestion early warning system based on traffic flow
   forecasting and extenics evaluation},
Journal = {APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {118},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Traffic congestion is a vital factor hindering travel. As such,
   developing a reliable traffic congestion early warning system is
   essential for providing traffic condition supervision and programming.
   However, previous research has rarely focused on traffic flow
   characteristics or on providing comprehensive assessments, resulting in
   poor warning performances. In this study, an innovative traffic
   congestion early warning system is proposed, comprising point
   forecasting, characteristic estimate, interval prediction, and
   comprehensive assessment. In the characteristic assessment phase, eight
   common statistical distributions are used to fit the characteristics of
   an original traffic flow parameter series in a training set, and the
   best fitting results are considered as the basis for building a
   prediction interval. An extreme learning machine combined with a
   modified multi-objective dragonfly optimization algorithm and
   variational mode decomposition is constructed in the point forecasting
   phase to provide accurate and stable traffic flow parameter forecasting
   results; two different strategies are used to establish the prediction
   interval, so as to conduct interval forecasting based on different types
   of uncertainty information (probability distribution information or
   known interval information). Extenics evaluation theory is then used in
   the comprehensive assessment phase to evaluate the traffic congestion
   level. Simulations of traffic flow parameter series, including
   simulations of the road density, road occupancy, and average velocity,
   reveal that the proposed early warning system demonstrates powerful
   abilities based on its precision and stability. The mean absolute
   percentage error (MAPE) values of the traffic flow parameters for the
   three datasets are 3.6265\%, 3.7203\%, and 4.5100\%, respectively. The
   forecasting accuracy for the traffic congestion level is more than 97\%
   for both point and interval prediction. Thus, this approach can be
   widely used for personal traffic route planning and the unified
   management of governmental traffic conditions.

Abstract = {WavePacket is an open-source program package for numeric simulations in
   quantum dynamics. It can solve time-independent or time-dependent linear
   Schrodinger and Liouville-von Neumann-equations in one or more
   dimensions. Also coupled equations can be treated, which allows, e.g.,
   to simulate molecular quantum dynamics beyond the Born-Oppenheimer
   approximation. Optionally accounting for the interaction with external
   electric fields within the semi-classical dipole approximation,
   WavePacket can be used to simulate experiments involving tailored light
   pulses in photo-induced physics or chemistry. Being highly versatile and
   offering visualization of quantum dynamics `on the fly', WavePacket is
   well suited for teaching or research projects in atomic, molecular and
   optical physics as well as in physical or theoretical chemistry.
   Building on the previous Part I {[}Comp. Phys. Comm. 213, 223-234
   (2017)] which dealt with closed quantum systems and discrete variable
   representations, the present Part II focuses on the dynamics of open
   quantum systems, with Lindblad operators modeling dissipation and
   dephasing. This part also describes the WavePacket function for optimal
   control of quantum dynamics, building on rapid monotonically convergent
   iteration methods. Furthermore, two different approaches to dimension
   reduction implemented in WavePacket are documented here. In the first
   one, a balancing transformation based on the concepts of controllability
   and observability Gramians is used to identify states that are neither
   well controllable nor well observable. Those states are either truncated
   or averaged out. In the other approach, the H2-error for a given reduced
   dimensionality is minimized by H2 optimal model reduction techniques,
   utilizing a bilinear iterative rational Krylov algorithm.
   The present work describes the MATLAB version of WavePacket 5.3.0 which
   is hosted and further developed at the Sourceforge platform, where also
   extensive Wiki-documentation as well as numerous worked-out
   demonstration examples with animated graphics can be found.
   Program summary
   Program Title: WAVEPACKET
   Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/9g8b7jychy.1
   Licensing provisions: GPLv3
   Programming language: MATLAB
   Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 213 (2017),
   223.
   Does the new version supersede the previous version?: The previous
   article focused on the treatment of closed quantum systems by discrete
   variable representations and implementation of various numerical
   algorithms for solving Schrobdinger's equations. Complementary to that,
   the present second part is concerned with open quantum systems and
   optimal control by external fields. In addition, two approaches to
   dimension reduction useful in modeling of quantum control are described.
   Reasons for the new version: The reason for having a second article on
   the WavePacket software package lies in the fact that a complete
   description of the package would have exceeded the scope of a regular
   article. Several significant features of the WAVEPACKET package are
   introduced here which could not be mentioned in the first article, due
   to length constraints.
   Summary of revisions: Here we describe the numerical treatment of open
   quantum systems dynamics modeled by Lindblad master equations. Moreover,
   we explain the WAVEPACKET functions for optimal control simulations,
   both for closed and open quantum systems. To address the problem of
   computational effort, two strategies for model reduction have been
   included.
   Nature of problem: Dynamics of closed and open systems are described by
   Schrodinger or Liouvillevon Neumann equations, respectively, where the
   latter ones will be restricted to the Lindblad master equation. Emphasis
   is on the interaction of quantum system with external electric fields,
   treated within the semi-classical dipole approximation. Quantum optimal
   control simulations are used for the design of tailored fields achieving
   specified targets in quantum dynamics. With these features, WAVEPACKET
   can be instrumental for the simulation, understanding, and prediction of
   modern experiments in atomic, molecular and optical physics involving
   temporally shaped fields.
   Solution method: Representing state vectors or reduced density matrices
   in a discrete basis, SchrOdinger or Liouville-von Neumann equations are
   cast into systems of ordinary differential equations. Those are treated
   by self-written or MATLAB'S built-in solvers, the latter ones offering
   adaptive time-stepping. The optimal control equations are solved by the
   rapid monotonically convergent iteration methods developed by Zhu,
   Rabitz, Ohtsuki and others. In order to reduce the dimensionality of
   large scale control problems, the balanced truncation method as well as
   H2-optimal model reduction approaches are available in WAVEPACKET.
   Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: The
   WAVEPACKET program package is rather easy and intuitive to use,
   providing visualization of quantum dynamics `on the fly'. It is mainly
   intended for low-dimensional systems, typically not exceeding three to
   five degrees of freedom. Detailed user guides and reference manuals are
   available through numerous Wiki pages hosted at the SOURCEFORGE platform
   where also a large number of well documented demonstration examples can
   be found. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The use of computers in statistical physics is common because the sheer
   number of equations that describe the behaviour of an entire system
   particle by particle often makes it impossible to solve them exactly.
   Monte Carlo methods form a particularly important class of numerical
   methods for solving problems in statistical physics. Although these
   methods are simple in principle, their proper use requires a good
   command of statistical mechanics, as well as considerable computational
   resources. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the usage of
   widely accessible graphics cards on personal computers can elevate the
   computing power in Monte Carlo simulations by orders of magnitude, thus
   allowing live classroom demonstration of phenomena that would otherwise
   be out of reach. As an example, we use the public goods game on a square
   lattice where two strategies compete for common resources in a social
   dilemma situation. We show that the second-order phase transition to an
   absorbing phase in the system belongs to the directed percolation
   universality class, and we compare the time needed to arrive at this
   result by means of the main processor and by means of a suitable
   graphics card. Parallel computing on graphics processing units has been
   developed actively during the last decade, to the point where today the
   learning curve for entry is anything but steep for those familiar with
   programming. The subject is thus ripe for inclusion in graduate and
   advanced undergraduate curricula, and we hope that this paper will
   facilitate this process in the realm of physics education. To that end,
   we provide a documented source code for an easy reproduction of
   presented results and for further development of Monte Carlo simulations
   of similar systems.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In elementary grades, comprehensive health education
   curricula have demonstrated effectiveness in addressing singular health
   issues. The Michigan Model for Health (MMH) was implemented and
   evaluated to determine its impact on nutrition, physical fitness, and
   safety knowledge and skills.
   METHODS: Schools (N=52) were randomly assigned to intervention and
   control conditions. Participants received MMH with 24 lessons in grade 4
   and 28 more lessons in grade 5 including material focusing on nutrition,
   physical fitness, and safety attitudes and skills. The 40-minute lessons
   were taught by the classroom teacher who received curriculum training
   and provided feedback on implementation fidelity. Self-report survey
   data were collected from the fourth-grade students (N=1983) prior to the
   intervention, immediately after the intervention, and 6 weeks after the
   intervention, with the same data collection schedule repeated in fifth
   grade. Analysis of the scales was conducted using a mixed-model
   approach.
   RESULTS: Students who received the curriculum had better nutrition,
   physical activity, and safety skills than the control-group students.
   Intervention students also reported higher consumption of fruits;
   however, no difference was reported for other types of food consumption.
   CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of the MMH in promoting fitness and safety
   supports the call for integrated strategies that begin in elementary
   grades, target multiple risk behaviors, and result in practical and
   financial benefits to schools.},

Title = {Hand hygiene behavior among Sri Lankan medical students during COVID-19
   pandemic},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 8},
Abstract = {Background Poor compliance with hand hygiene practices among medical
   students poses a risk for cross-infection. It has become more critical
   during the COVID-19 pandemic than ever before. This study aimed to
   determine the knowledge, attitudes, practices of hand hygiene among
   final-year medical students. It also explored reported hand hygiene
   behavior before the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for educational
   strategies to correct the deficiencies. Methods A concurrent
   mixed-method approach was used. In the quantitative strand, a
   cross-sectional online survey was carried out via a Google form.
   Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-squared test were used for comparisons. In
   the qualitative strand, twelve participants were interviewed, based on a
   semi-structured interview guide and audio recorded. Transcribed data
   were evaluated with thematic content analysis. Results A total of 225
   final-year medical students were studied in the quantitative strand.
   Most were females. The mean score for knowledge was 3.35 +/- 0.795 out
   of six. Of them, 31.6 \% of participants scored below 3 points (< 50 \%
   of the total). Most (78.9 \%) had positive attitudes (score of > 80 \%).
   Only 36.4 \% reported ``adequate{''} hand hygiene performance in all
   eight dimensions of the behavior domain. Noticeably, fewer participants
   reported to clean their hands after checking blood pressure (55.6 \%),
   and only 66.2 \% stated carrying a hand sanitizer in their pocket.
   Significant correlations were not found between reported behavior and
   attitudes (p = 0.821) or knowledge (p = 0.794). The qualitative strand
   with 12 respondents revealed the positive influence of both hierarchical
   and non-hierarchal role models. Time constraints, skin irritation, and
   workload pressures were the main barriers. Frequent reminders,
   supervision, and interactive teaching were suggested as methods to
   improve hand hygiene compliance. They also stated that increased
   enthusiasm was noted on hand hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic
   compared to the pre-pandemic period. Conclusions Most of the
   participants had positive attitudes towards hand hygiene. Yet, a
   considerable gap between attitudes and knowledge and reported hand
   hygiene behavior was evident. Coupling educational programs that use
   cognitive and behavioral methods, including role modeling, supervision,
   and frequent reminders, is recommended to bridge the
   knowledge-attitude-behavior gap.},

Abstract = {These are challenging times for physicians. Extensive changes in the
   practice environment have altered the nature of physicians' interactions
   with patients and their role in the health care delivery system. Many
   physicians feel as if they are ``cogs in the wheel{''} of austere
   corporations that care more about productivity and finances than
   compassion or quality. They often do not see how the strategy and plan
   of their organization align with the values of the profession. Despite
   their expertise, they frequently do not feel they have a voice or input
   in the operational plan of their work unit, department, or organization.
   At their core, the authors believe all of these factors represent
   leadership issues. Many models of leadership have been proposed, and
   there are a number of effective philosophies and approaches. Here, the
   authors propose a new integrative model of Wellness-Centered Leadership
   (WCL). WCL includes core skills and qualities from the foremost
   leadership philosophies along with evidence on the relationship between
   leadership and physician well-being and distills them into a single
   framework designed to cultivate leadership behaviors that promote
   engagement and professional fulfillment. The 3 elements of WCL are: care
   about people always, cultivate individual and team relationships, and
   inspire change. A summary of the mindset, behaviors, and outcomes of the
   elements of the WCL model is presented, and the application of the
   elements for physician leaders is discussed. The authors believe that
   learning and developing the skills that advance these elements should be
   the aspiration of all health care leaders and a foundational focus of
   leadership development programs. If cultivated, the authors believe that
   WCL will empower individual and team performance to address the current
   problems faced by health care organizations as well as the iterative
   innovation needed to address challenges that may arise in the decades to
   come.},

   salutogenic perspective},

Abstract = {Sport is widely recognised as having the potential to enhance the
   personal development of socially vulnerable youth, yet there is very
   limited knowledge on how community sports coaches can create optimal
   social conditions for life skill development and transferability. We
   adopt a salutogenic approach in order to study whether and how community
   sports coaches create these optimal social conditions. Based on the
   salutogenic framework, a thematic analysis was conducted of 15 in-depth
   interviews with community sports coaches providing sports lessons to
   socially vulnerable youth. As part of the interviews, the sports coaches
   were presented with several training scenarios and asked how they would
   respond in specific training situations. The results showed that the
   sports coaches aimed to create meaningful sporting experiences for
   youths. These meaningful sporting experiences were considered a
   precondition for keeping youths engaged in the sporting activities, as
   well as a precondition for life skill development. The sports coaches
   specifically focused on creating little moments of success and on making
   sure that the youths felt they belonged to a group. In order to ensure
   that the youths could experience moments of success, specific coaching
   strategies were implemented to increase the youths' comprehensibility
   and manageability in specific sport situations. According to the sports
   coaches, experiencing little moments of success could contribute to an
   increase in socially vulnerable youths' understanding of the everyday
   challenges that they face, as well as contribute to their ability to
   deal with these challenges. Creating meaningful sporting experiences may
   help youths `to learn to cope' - a skill that could be beneficial over
   their lifespan and in different societal domains.},

Abstract = {Effective communication among healthcare professionals is critical to
   delivering safe, high-quality patient care. One important real-world
   skill that nursing students must acquire is generating accurate handoff
   communication reports. The central aim of this study was to build,
   assess, and revise a virtual experience simulation that allows nursing
   students to observe a standardized clinical situation in an immersive
   environment and then practice the
   situation-background-assessment-recommendation communication method.
   This between-groups experimental study, which was modified in light of
   COVID-19 concerns, evaluated how well 69 prelicensure nursing students
   understood a handoff communication report after viewing a virtual human
   patient and nurse interact during a triage assessment scenario. Results
   indicate student comprehension levels did not differ based on which of
   two metacognitive learning strategies was used. Participants in both
   study groups were able to accurately complete a
   situation-background-assessment-recommendation instrument based on the
   virtual experience. Further, they believed that watching a virtual nurse
   perform a triage assessment would help them perform one themselves in a
   similar virtual environment. There was also an unexpected study finding
   related to patient safety within the context of the simulation. This
   finding warrants further research that will lead to revision of the
   virtual experience used to train future nurses.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND In Spartanburg County, SC, nearly 33.7\% of children are
   overweight or obese. The purpose of this study was to investigate
   differences in eating behavior of youth by race/ethnicity and
   socioeconomic status. METHODS Students (N = 997) in 4th to 5th grades
   completed the School Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey. School
   databases categorized students as either White or racial/ethnic minority
   and free/reduced or full paid lunch status. Dietary behaviors included
   13 composite measures: unhealthy proteins, healthy proteins, dairy,
   refined grains, whole grains, vegetables, fruit, fried snacks,
   sugar-sweetened beverages, sweets, and consumption of a breakfast,
   evening, and/or restaurant meal. Logistic regression, controlling for
   sex, was used to analyze differences in consumption for each nutrition
   variable. RESULTS Minority youth were less likely to consume healthy
   proteins (odds ratio {[}OR] = 0.71, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] =
   0.55-0.92) and more likely to eat at a restaurant (OR = 1.32, 95\% CI =
   1.02-1.70) compared to white youth. Lower socioeconomic status youth
   were less likely to eat an evening meal compared to higher socioeconomic
   status youth (OR = 0.59, 95\% CI = 0.39-0.89). CONCLUSIONS Differences
   in dietary behaviors may result from food accessibility and insecurity
   in minority and/or low-income neighborhoods. Future research should
   explore policy strategies that can help ensure all youth maintain
   healthy eating habits and weight status.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant ramifications for provider
   well-being. During these unprecedented and challenging times, one
   institution's Department of Surgery put in place several important
   initiatives for promoting the well-being of trainees as they were
   redeployed to provide care to COVID-19 patients. In this article, the
   authors describe these initiatives, which fall into 3 broad categories:
   redeploying faculty and trainees, ensuring provider safety, and
   promoting trainee wellness.
   The redeployment initiatives are the following: reframing the team
   mindset, creating a culture of grace and forgiveness, establishing a
   multidisciplinary wellness committee, promoting centralized leadership,
   providing clear communication, coordinating between departments and
   programs, implementing phased restructuring of the department's
   services, establishing scheduling flexibility and redundancy, adhering
   to training regulations, designating a trainee ombudsperson, assessing
   physical health risks for high-risk individuals, and planning for
   structured deimplementation.
   Initiatives specific to promoting provider safety are appointing a
   trainee safety advocate, guaranteeing personal protective equipment and
   relevant information about these materials, providing guidance regarding
   safe practices at home, and offering alternative housing options when
   necessary.
   Finally, the initiatives put in place to directly promote trainee
   wellness are establishing an environment of psychological safety,
   providing mental health resources, maintaining the educational missions,
   solidifying a sense of community by showing appreciation, being
   attentive to childcare, and using social media to promote community
   morale.
   The initiatives to carry out the department's strategy presented in this
   article, which were well received by both faculty and trainee members of
   the authors' community, may be employed in other departments and even
   outside the context of COVID-19. The authors hope that colleagues at
   other institutions and departments, independent of specialty, will find
   the initiatives described here helpful during, and perhaps after, the
   pandemic as they develop their own institution-specific strategies to
   promote trainee wellness.},

Title = {Rescoring of docking poses under Occam's Razor: are there simpler

Abstract = {Ligand affinity prediction from docking simulations is usually performed
   by means of highly empirical and diverse protocols. These protocols
   often involve the re-scoring of poses generated by a force field (FF)
   based Hamiltonian to provide either estimated binding affinitiesor
   alternatively, some empirical goodness score. Re-scoring is performed by
   so-called scoring functionstypically, a reweighted sum of FF terms
   augmented by additional terms (e.g., desolvation/entropic penalty,
   hydrophobicity, aromatic interactions etc.). Sometimes, the scoring
   function actually drives ligand positioning, but often it only operates
   on the best scoring poses ranked top by the initial ligand positioning
   tool. In either of these rather intricate scenarios, scoring functions
   are docking-specific models, and most require machine-learning-based
   calibration. Therefore, docking simulations are less straightforward
   when compared to standard molecular simulations in which the FF
   Hamiltonian defines the energy, and affinity emerges as an ensemble
   average property over pools of representative conformers (i.e., the
   trajectory). Paraphrasing on Occam's Razor principle, additional model
   complexity is only acceptable if demonstrated to bring a significant
   improvement of prediction quality. In this work we therefore examined
   whether the complexity inherent to scoring functions is indeed
   justified. For this purpose we compared sampler for multiple
   protein-ligand entities, a general purpose conformation sampler based on
   the AMBER/GAFF FF, complemented with continuum solvation terms, with
   several state of the art docking tools that rely on calibrated scoring
   functions (Glide, Gold, Autodock-Vina) in terms of its ability to
   top-rank the actives from large and diverse ligand series associated
   with various proteins. There is no clear winner of this study, where
   each program performed well on most of the targets, but also failed with
   respect to at least one of them. Therefore, a well-parameterized force
   field with a simple, energy-based ligand ranking protocol appears to be
   anas effective docking protocol as intricate rescoring strategies based
   on scoring functions. Atool that can sample the conformational space of
   the free ligand, the bound ligand and the protein binding site using the
   same force field may avoidmany of the approximations common to
   contemporary docking protocols and allow e.g., for docking into highly
   flexible active sites, when current scoring functions are not well
   suited to estimate receptor strain energies.},

Abstract = {Objective: To conduct a comprehensive process evaluation of a policy,
   systems, and environmental (PSE) change intervention.
   Design: Quasi-experimental, mixed methods.
   Setting: Low-income urban school district.
   Participants: Fifth-grade students in 4 schools assigned to 2
   intervention and 2 comparison schools (intervention, n = 142;
   comparison, n = 170).
   Intervention: Both groups received a nutrition curriculum delivered by
   classroom teachers. Intervention schools also received 10 PSE lessons
   taught by paraprofessional educators.
   Main Outcome Measures: Quantitative data were obtained from fidelity and
   observation checklists, grading rubrics and self-reported student
   surveys. Focus group and interviews provided qualitative data.
   Quantitative measures included assessments of PSE and fruit and
   vegetable knowledge, as well as assessment of times fruits and
   vegetables (FV) were consumed yesterday.
   Analyses: Qualitative data were analyzed using inductive content
   analysis. Quantitative data were analyzed using repeated measures
   analysis of variance and analysis of co-variance.
   Results: Fidelity, dose, reach, and acceptance of PSE intervention were
   high; students felt more empowered, although PSE lessons were considered
   lengthy and complicated. Intervention PSE and FV knowledge scores were
   significantly higher than comparison scores (F-37.56, P < .001; and
   F-3.94, P < .05, respectively). However, issues in communication were
   identified between school staff and researchers.
   Conclusions and Implications: Policy, systems, and environmental
   classroom interventions commented on the differences between
   quantitative and qualitative assessments, and this suggests the need for
   more sensitive quantitative assessments. Future research should look at
   long-term outcomes as this study only looked at short-term outcomes.},

Title = {Exploration of mindfulness in relation to compassion, empathy and
   reflection within nursing education},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {40},
Pages = {188-190},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background: This article will look at the viability of the inclusion of
   mindfulness into the nursing curriculum. In nursing, the environment
   rarely allows the time for contemplation, though reflection is
   encouraged specifically in regard to the care we confer on our patients
   and how that impacts on us professionally. Student nurses are taught to
   hide their feelings to a point where they cannot find it themselves
   under their professional armour. Mindfulness is a possible way of
   bridging this gap.
   Discussion: Our nursing code is geared to safeguard the patient from any
   harm as well as our colleagues but little is done or said in support of
   our own personal psychological or emotional health. The helping
   professions are restricted by legislation which has had an impact of
   fostering caution and fearfulness. In using mindfulness it can be seen
   as a possibility in building a bridge between what actually happens in a
   nurse's professional life and the possibility of reengaging with that
   internal emotional space.
   If student nurses begin to incorporate mindfulness techniques, in
   reality this should make a difference. This was experienced with
   students doing these exercises, who reported anecdotally feeling more
   centred. As they have progressed in the course feedback from the
   students using the techniques has been positive not only for the
   students but also for them using the skills in a clinical setting,
   benefiting patients.
   Conclusion: Mindfulness has been used as a part of the modality of
   health care. It is clear that mindfulness is another way of dealing with
   the stressors of the modem heath service in which the students are being
   introduced. Incorporating this coping strategy into the curriculum
   ensures that students will have the tools to deal with the stressors of
   the course, which in turn will enhance the student experience. (C) 2016

Title = {On minimizing flow monitoring costs in large-scale software-defined
   network networks},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NETWORK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the rise of novel network applications such
   as telesurgery, telepresence, and holoportation. As such applications
   have stringent performance requirements, timely and accurate traffic
   monitoring becomes of paramount importance to be able to react in a
   timely and efficient manner, and swiftly adjust the network
   configuration to achieve the sought-after requirements. However,
   existing monitoring schemes are either incurring high cost (e.g., high
   bandwidth consumption) due to the large number of monitoring messages or
   inefficient when they incur high reporting delay (i.e., the time needed
   for a monitoring message to reach the controller) making the collected
   statistics obsolete. In this paper, we address this problem and propose
   monitoring mechanisms for software defined networks that minimize the
   monitoring cost while satisfying an upper bound on the reporting delay
   of the statistics. Our solutions allow to carefully select the switch
   that should report the statistics about each flow crossing the network
   taking into consideration the available bandwidth and the capacity of
   the switch (i.e., the maximum number of flows that it can monitor). In
   particular, we formulate the switch-to-flow selection problem as an
   integer linear program and propose two heuristic algorithms to cope with
   large-scale instances of the problem. We consider the scenario where a
   single controller is collecting statistics and another where statistics
   are collected by multiple controllers. Simulation results show that the
   proposed algorithms provide near-optimal solutions with minimal
   computation time and outperform existing monitoring strategies in terms
   of monitoring cost and reporting delay.},

Title = {From virtual to physical environments when judging action opportunities:
   are diagnostics and trainings transferable?},
Journal = {VIRTUAL REALITY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 FEB 15},
Abstract = {The proper evaluation of whether our given bodily capabilities and
   environmental properties allow particular actions is indispensable for
   pertinent decisions, so-called affordance judgments. These can be
   impacted by older age or brain damage. Virtual Environments (VEs) may
   provide an efficient opportunity to offer trainings. But do people make
   affordance judgments in VEs in the same way that they do in Physical
   Environments (PEs)? And are these decisions trainable by use of VEs? We
   investigated 24 healthy young adults' judgment performance of whether or
   not they could fit their hand into a given aperture. They were presented
   with a set of opening-increments and indicated their judgments by
   pressing a yes- or no-button. The stimuli were presented in PE using an
   aperture apparatus and in VE displayed by use of Oculus Rift goggles.
   Our results demonstrated the level of equivalence to be specific to the
   variable: While we found equivalence between VE and PE for the accuracy
   parameter, results were uncertain or non-equivalent for perceptual
   sensitivity and for judgment tendency, respectively. When applying
   training in VE, judgment accuracy improved significantly when tested
   subsequently within VE. Improvement appeared detectable in PE only on a
   descriptive level. Furthermore, equivalence testing post-training
   revealed that perceptual sensitivity performance in VE approached a
   PE-level. Promisingly, the VE training approach appeared applicable and
   efficacious within the VE. Future studies need to specify factors that
   enhance equivalence for detection theory variables and that facilitate
   transfer from VEs to PEs when judging action opportunities.},

Title = {Entrustment in physician-patient communication: a modified Delphi study
   using the EPA approach},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Background Competency based curricula across the globe stress on the
   importance of effective physician patient communication. A variety of
   courses have been used to train physicians for this purpose. However,
   few of them link competencies with practice resulting in confusions in
   implementation and assessment. This issue can be resolved by treating
   certain specific patient communication related tasks as acts of
   entrustment or entrustable professional activities (EPAs). In this
   study, we aimed to define a competency-based framework for assessing
   patient physician communication using the language of EPAs. Methods A
   modified Delphi study was conducted in three stages. The first stage was
   an extensive literature review to identify and elaborate communication
   related tasks which could be treated as EPAs. The second stage was
   content validation by medical education experts for clarity and
   representativeness. The third stage was three iterative rounds of
   modified Delphi with predefined consensus levels. The McNemar test was
   used to check response stability in the Delphi Rounds. Results Expert
   consensus resulted in development of 4 specific EPAs focused on
   physician-patient communication with their competencies and respective
   assessment strategies all aiming for level 5 of unsupervised practice.
   These include Providing information to the patient or their family about
   diagnosis or prognosis; Breaking Bad news to the patient or their
   family; Counseling a patient regarding their disease or illness;
   Resolving conflicts with patients or their families. Conclusions The
   EPAs for Physician-patient communication are a step toward an
   integrative, all-inclusive competency-based assessment framework for
   patient-centered care. They are meant to improve the quality of
   physician patient interaction by standardizing communication as a
   decision of entrustment. The EPAs can be linked to competency frameworks
   around the world and provide a useful assessment framework for effective
   training in patient communication. They can be integrated into any post
   graduate curriculum and can also serve as a self-assessment tool for
   postgraduate training programs across the globe to improve their patient
   communication curricula.},

Abstract = {Apache Spark as a popular in-memory data analytic framework has been
   employed by various applications-such as machine learning, graph
   computation, and scientific computing, which benefit from the
   long-running process (e.g., executor) programming model to avoid system
   I/O overhead. However, existing resource allocation strategies mainly
   rely on the peak demand, which are normally specified by users. Since
   the resource usages of long-running applications like iterative
   computation vary significantly over time, we find that peak demand based
   resource allocation policies lead to low cloud utilization in production
   environments. In this article, we present a utilization aware resource
   provisioning approach for iterative workloads on Apache Spark (i.e.,
   \$\{iSpark\}\$iSpark). It can identify the causes of resource
   underutilization due to an inflexible resource policy, and elastically
   adjusts the allocated executors over time according to the real-time
   resource usage. In general, iterative applications require more
   computation resources at the beginning stage and their demands for
   resources diminish as more iterations are completed. iSpark aims to
   timely scale up or scale down the number of executors in order to fully
   utilize the allocated resources while taking the dominant factor into
   consideration. It further preempts the underutilized executors and
   preserves the cached intermediate data to ensure the data consistency.
   Testbed evaluations show that iSpark averagely improves the resource
   utilization of individual executors by 35.2\% compared to vanilla Spark.
   At the same time, it increases the cluster utilization from 32.1\% to
   51.3\% and effectively reduces the overall job completion time by 20.8\%
   for a set of representative iterative applications. Furthermore, we have
   extended iSpark to multi-tenancy cloud environments. Specifically,
   iSpark characterizes a virtual node based on two real-time measured
   performance statistics: I/O rate and CPU steal time. Thus, we extend the
   two-dimensional resource constraints (i.e., CPU and MeM) in iSpark to
   three-dimensional resource constraints (i.e., CPU, MeM and I/O) in the
   cloud environment. We consider two representative interference scenarios
   in the cloud: stable interference and dynamic interference. Experimental
   results on virtual clusters with varying interferences show that iSpark
   with cloud extension improves the average job completion time by 68\%
   compared to default Spark resource allocation policies.},

Title = {Exploring the tensions of being and becoming a medical educator},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {MAR 23},
Abstract = {Background: Previous studies have identified tensions medical faculty
   encounter in their roles but not specifically those with a qualification
   in medical education. It is likely that those with postgraduate
   qualifications may face additional tensions (i.e., internal or external
   conflicts or concerns) from differentiation by others, greater
   responsibilities and translational work against the status quo. This
   study explores the complex and multi-faceted tensions of educators with
   qualifications in medical education at various stages in their career.
   Methods: The data described were collected in 2013-14 as part of a
   larger, three-phase mixed-methods research study employing a
   constructivist grounded theory analytic approach to understand identity
   formation among medical educators. The over-arching theoretical
   framework for the study was Communities of Practice. Thirty-six
   educators who had undertaken or were undertaking a postgraduate
   qualification in medical education took part in semi-structured
   interviews.
   Results: Participants expressed multiple tensions associated with both
   becoming and being a healthcare educator. Educational roles had to be
   juggled with clinical work, challenging their work-life balance. Medical
   education was regarded as having lower prestige, and therefore pay, than
   other healthcare career tracks. Medical education is a vast speciality,
   making it difficult as a generalist to keep up-to-date in all its areas.
   Interestingly, the graduates with extensive experience in education
   reported no fears, rather asserting that the qualification gave them job
   variety.
   Conclusion: This is the first detailed study exploring the tensions of
   educators with postgraduate qualifications in medical education. It
   complements and extends the findings of the previous studies by
   identifying tensions common as well as specific to active students and
   graduates. These tensions may lead to detachment, cynicism and a weak
   sense of identity among healthcare educators. Postgraduate programmes in
   medical education can help their students identify these tensions in
   becoming and develop coping strategies. Separate career routes, specific
   job descriptions and academic workload models for medical educators are
   recommended to further the professionalisation of medical education.

   Microsurgical Models - A Systematic Review},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to (1) systematically review
   all the literature pertaining to microsurgical training models and to
   (2) determine which of these are specific to and validated for
   microsurgery training.
   DESIGN: PubMed, MEDLINE (OVID/EBSCO), Google Scholar, and Cochrane
   Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched using preset terms.
   The last search date was in July 2012. Articles of all languages, years
   of publication, sample sizes, and model types pertaining to microsurgery
   were included. The eligibility criteria included the use of a
   microsurgical training model on a subject group with statistical
   analysis and measures of validation. Two assessors independently
   reviewed the articles and their references.
   RESULTS: Of the 238 articles reviewed, 9 articles met the criteria.
   Those excluded were predominantly model descriptions that had not been
   validated in a set of learners. The 9 models whose performances were
   assessed in a group of learners included an online curriculum, nonliving
   prosthetics and biologics, and the live rat femoral artery model. Each
   model was evaluated for content, construct, face, and criterion
   (concurrent and predictive) validity, as well as selection and
   observation/expectant bias. Content, construct, concurrent, and face
   validities were consistently demonstrated for all 9 models. Selection
   bias was also reliably well controlled with random allocation of
   participants to each study group. Observation/expectant bias was
   controlled in 6 of the 8 papers. Predictive validity, an arguably more
   difficult factor to measure, was only present in 1 article.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite a plethora of papers describing microsurgical
   learning tools, only 9 were discovered that provided validation of the
   proposed method of microsurgical skills acquisition. This review depicts
   the need for basic, yet well-designed studies that substantiate the
   effectiveness of microsurgical training models by using a subject group
   and demonstrating a statistical improvement with employment of the
   model. Ease of access, cost, and assessment tools used also require
   attention. ((C) 2014 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

Abstract = {The paper examines the effects of five major socialization agents namely
   parents, peers, traditional media, the Internet, and music industry on
   emerging adults' attitudes and behavior toward music piracy in the form
   of unauthorized downloading. Based upon self-reported behavior, our
   study shows that these socialization agents exert differential effects
   on music piracy. Specifically, peers and the Internet exert direct
   impact on both attitudes and behavior. Parents and music industry,
   however, only have indirect impact on emerging adults' piracy behavior
   through shaping their attitudes. The research further shows that the
   effects of socialization agents differ across consumer segments. A
   factor mixture modeling technique is first applied to disentangle the
   behavioral heterogeneity, and more observable factors such as
   demographic, social, and psychological variables are then utilized to
   profile members in each segment. From a managerial perspective, this
   research provides new avenues for managers and policy makers to design
   targeted prevention programs to curtail music piracy. Published by

Abstract = {The communication of web services is typically organized through public
   APIs, which rely on a common data model shared among all system
   components. Over time, this data model must be changed in order to
   accommodate new or changing requirements, and the system components
   including the data they are operating on must be migrated. In practice,
   however, not all the affected components can be migrated instantly and
   at the same time. A common approach is to plan data model changes in a
   backward compatible fashion, which eventually causes serious maintenance
   problems and is a common cause of technical debt. In this paper, we
   propose an alternative solution to this problem by using a translation
   layer serving as a round-trip migration service which is responsible for
   the lossless forth-and-back translation of object-oriented data model
   instances of different versions. We present a framework which offers a
   version-aware interface definition language (IDL) for APIs, a typed
   JavaScript-based language for defining migration functions using the IDL
   definition, and a run-time environment for executing migrations. This is
   bundled into an integrated development environment assisting developers
   in implementing migration functions. From a methodological point of
   view, the development of round-trip migrations is supported by a catalog
   which comprises a set of typical data model evolution scenarios along
   with corresponding suitable round-trip migration strategies. We validate
   our framework by carrying out an extensive evaluation including a
   systematic assessment of expressiveness using our catalog,
   micro-benchmarking the performance of round-trip migrations, as well as
   a practical application in a case study of a real-world e-commerce web
   application obtained from an industrial partner.},

Title = {Teleconsultations and their implications for health care: A qualitative
   study on patients' and physicians' perceptions},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {162},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Digitization in everyday medical practice has gained
   importance along with the drive to expand teleconsultations arising from
   the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous qualitative research on
   teleconsultations has focused on synchronous communication between
   patients and clinicians. This study aims to explore physicians' and
   patients' perspectives on the adoption of teleconsultations between
   primary care and the referral cardiology department. Methods:
   Participants were recruited for semi-structured interviews between
   September 2019 and January 2020. The interviews were audio-recorded and
   pseudonymized. The transcribed interviews were stored, coded, and
   content analysis was performed in MAXQDA.Results: A total of 29
   participants were interviewed. Patients and physicians merged in their
   views on `process' issues, i.e., those concerning a better
   prioritization of patients and an improved collaborative practice,
   albeit with possible technological constraints. Physicians recognized
   that teleconsultations presented an educational opportunity for managing
   patients' health problems. Our findings suggest that not all patients
   would require equally intensive collaborative activities across the
   health system. The barriers described included difficulties using the
   system (technical issues) and concerns about workload as a consequence
   of the disruption of traditional clinical routines. Increasing the range
   of collaborative strategies available to health care providers may
   require a broader assessment of the way that care processes are
   structured between levels of care. Patients revealed strong support for
   teleconsultation on the grounds of interprofessional collaboration and
   avoidance of unnecessary hospital visits. Conclusions: The
   implementation of teleconsultations between levels of care may be
   facilitated when patients, caregivers and physicians see the added value
   of this service, that adequate resources are put in place and that there
   is flexible implementation. This work adds an in-depth understanding of
   participants' perceptions of this intervention in a case study.
   Obtaining context-dependent knowledge will help program leaders better
   understand how to establish telemedicine services as a real-world
   sustainable option.},

Title = {HEP-Frame: Improving the efficiency of pipelined data transformation \&
   filtering for scientific analyses},
Journal = {COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {263},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Software to analyse very large sets of experimental data often relies on
   a pipeline of irregular computational tasks with decisions to remove
   irrelevant data from further processing. A user-centred framework was
   designed and deployed, HEP-Frame, which aids domain experts to develop
   applications for scientific data analyses and to monitor and control
   their efficient execution. The key feature of HEP-Frame is the
   performance portability of the code across different heterogeneous
   platforms, due to a novel adaptive multi-layer scheduler, seamlessly
   integrated into the tool, an approach not available in competing
   frameworks.
   The multi-layer scheduler transparently allocates parallel data/tasks
   across the available heteroge-neous resources, dynamically balances
   threads among data input and computational tasks, adaptively reorders in
   run-time the parallel execution of the pipeline stages for each data
   stream, respecting data dependencies, and efficiently manages the
   execution of library functions in accelerators. Each layer implements a
   specific scheduling strategy: one balances the execution of the
   computational stages of the pipeline, distributing the execution of the
   stages of the same or different dataset elements among the available
   computing threads; another controls the order of the pipeline stages
   execution, so that most data is filtered out earlier and later stages
   execute the computationally heavy tasks; yet another adaptively balances
   the automatically created threads among data input and the computational
   tasks, taking into account the requirements of each application.
   Simulated data analyses from sensors in the ATLAS Experiment at CERN
   evaluated the scheduler efficiency, on dual multicore Xeon servers with
   and without accelerators, and on servers with the many-core Intel KNL.
   Experimental results show significant improved performance of these data
   analyses due to HEP-Frame features and the codes scaled well on multiple
   servers. Results also show the improved HEP-Frame scheduler performance
   over the key competitor, the HEFT list scheduler.
   The best overall performance improvement over a real fine tuned
   sequential data analysis was impressive in both homogeneous and
   heterogeneous multicore servers and in many-core servers: 81x faster in
   the homogeneous 24+24 core Skylake server, 86x faster in the
   heterogeneous 12+12 core Ivy Bridge server with the Kepler GPU, and 252x
   faster in the 64-core KNL server.

   . Nature of problem: Scientific data analysis applications are often
   developed to process large amounts of data obtained through experimental
   measurements or Monte Carlo simulations, aiming to identify patterns in
   the data or to test and/or validate theories. These large inputs are
   usually processed by a pipeline of computational tasks that may filter
   out irrelevant data (a task and its filter is addressed as a proposition
   in this communication), preventing it from being processed by subsequent
   tasks in the pipeline.
   This data filtering, coupled with the fact that propositions may have
   different computational intensities, contribute to the irregularity of
   the pipeline execution.
   This can lead to scientific data analyses I/O-, memory-, or
   compute-bound performance limitations, depending on the implemented
   algorithms and input data. To allow scientists to process more data with
   more accurate results their code and data structures should be optimized
   for the computing resources they can access. Since the main goal of most
   scientists is to obtain results relevant to their scientific fields,
   often within strict deadlines, optimizing the performance of their
   applications is very time consuming and is usually overlooked.
   Scientists require a software framework to aid the design and
   development of efficient applications and to control their parallel
   execution on distinct computing platforms.
   Solution method: This work proposes HEP-Frame, a framework to aid the
   development and efficient execution of pipelined scientific analysis
   applications on homogeneous and heterogeneous servers. HEP-Frame is a
   user-centred framework to aid scientists to develop applications to
   analyse data from a large number of dataset elements, with a flexible
   pipeline of propositions. It not only stresses the interface to domain
   experts so that code is more robust and is developed faster, but it also
   aims high-performance portability across different types of parallel
   computing platforms and desirable sustainability features. This
   framework aims to provide efficient parallel code execution without
   requiring user expertise in parallel computing.
   Frameworks to aid the design and deployment of scientific code usually
   fall into two categories: (i) resource-centred, closer to the computing
   platforms, where execution efficiency and performance portability are
   the main goals, but forces developers to adapt their code to strict
   framework con-straints; (ii) user-centred, which stresses the interface
   to domain experts to improve their code development speed and
   robustness, aiming to provide desirable sustainability features but
   disregarding the execution performance. There are also a set of
   frameworks that merge these two categories (Liu et al., 2015 {[}1];
   Deelman et al., 2015 {[}2]) for scientific computing. While they do not
   have steep learning curves, concessions have to be made to their ease of
   use to allow for their broader scope of targeted applications. HEP-Frame
   attempts to merge this gap, placing itself between a fully user-or
   resource-centred framework, so that users develop code quickly and do
   not have to worry about the computational efficiency of the code It
   handles (i) by ensuring efficient execution of applications according to
   their computational requirements and the available resources on the
   server through a multi-layer scheduler, while (ii) is addressed by
   automatically generating code skeletons and transparently managing the
   data structure and automating repetitive tasks.
   Additional comments: An early stage proof-of-concept was published in a
   conference proceedings (Pereira et al., 2015). However, the HEP-Frame
   version presented in this communication only shares a very small portion
   of the code related to the skeleton generation (less than 5\% of the
   overall code), while the rest of the user interface, multi-layer
   scheduler, and parallelization strategies were completely redesigned and
   re-implemented.

Title = {Effect of a culturally sensitive DEmentia Competence Education for
   Nursing home Taskforce (DECENT) programme in China: A quasi-experimental
   study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {116},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Existing educational programmes for building capacity in
   dementia care are developed in the Western culture; their applicability
   and cultural relevancy to other cultures is questionable. There is a
   dearth of culturally specific dementia-care educational programme for
   Chinese communities. Objectives: To evaluate a culturally specific
   DEmentia Competence Education for Nursing home Taskforce (DECENT)
   programme in mainland China. Design: A multi-site quasi-experimental
   study. Methods: Nursing homes were pair-matched and allocated into
   intervention (n = 5) and control group (n = 5). The DECENT programme was
   delivered face-to-face using multiple pedagogies for 60-90 min per
   session by a trained educator once per week over 8 weeks. The primary
   outcome was the sense of competence in dementia care. The secondary
   outcomes were dementia knowledge, attitudes towards people with
   dementia, personcentred care in nursing homes and the severity of
   behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia of residents with
   dementia and staff-perceived disturbance. They were measured at baseline
   (T0), immediately postintervention (T1) and 3 months after the
   intervention (T2). Results: The intervention group has significantly
   greater improvement than control group in sense of competence both at T1
   (B = 5.24, p < .001) and T2 (B = 4.43, p = .013). Regarding dementia
   knowledge and person-centred care, intervention group only showed
   greater improvement than control group at T1 (B = 3.18, p = .001; B =
   5.75, p = .018, respectively), but not at T2 (p = .089 and .104,
   respectively). Group differences in attitudes and severity of behavioral
   and psychological symptoms of dementia and staff-perceived disturbance
   were not significant at both time points. Conclusions: The DECENT
   programme is applicable and beneficial in improving staff's sense of
   competence in dementia care in Chinese communities, but reinforcement
   strategies are needed to sustain the effect for maintaining the learnt
   knowledge and changed person-centred care practice.},

Title = {Mindfulness based stress reduction for medical students: optimising
   student satisfaction and engagement},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Month = {AUG 18},
Abstract = {Background: Medical practitioners and students are at increased risk of
   a number of personal and psychological problems. Stress and anxiety due
   to work-load and study requirements are common and self-care methods are
   important in maintaining well-being. The current study examines
   perceptions of and satisfaction ratings with a mindfulness based stress
   reduction (MBSR) programme for 1st year (compulsory) and 2nd year
   (optional) Graduate Entry Medical School students.
   Methods: A mixed method pre and post study of Year 1 (n = 140) and Year
   2 (n = 88) medical students completing a 7 week MBSR course compared
   student satisfaction ratings. Thematic analysis of feedback from the
   students on their perception of the course was also carried out.
   Results: Year 1 students (compulsory course) were less satisfied with
   content and learning outcomes than Year 2 students (optional course) (p
   < .0005). Thematic analysis of year 1 student feedback identified themes
   including great concept, poorly executed; and less discussion, more
   practice. Year 2 themes included session environment and satisfaction
   with tutors.
   Conclusions: The MBSR course was associated with high levels of
   satisfaction and positive feedback when delivered on an optional basis.
   Catering for the individual needs of the participant and promoting a
   safe environment are core elements of a successful self-care programme.},

Abstract = {Objective: To describe the mixed-methods formative research phase in the
   development of the Healthy Environments Study (HEROs), a
   technology-based, interactive family intervention to promote healthy
   eating and activity behaviors for young children in the home
   environment.
   Design: A mixed-method iterative approach, using ecocultural theory as a
   framework, will guide the development of both quantitative and
   qualitative formative research assessments.
   Setting: Rural eastern Colorado.
   Participants: Low-income families (n = 200) with preschool-aged children
   enrolled at 6 Head Start/preschool centers.
   Main Outcome Measures: Quantitative and qualitative methodologies will
   garner insights into 4 key topic areas: (1) food behaviors and
   environments (Remote Food Photography Method, parent focus group, and
   survey), (2) physical activity behaviors and environments (parent
   interview and survey), (3) mobile device use (parent survey and
   interview), and (4) daily life (ecocultural family interview and
   teacher/staff group discussions).
   Analysis: Results will be interpreted in combination to allow for a
   holistic understanding of participant behaviors, beliefs, attitudes and
   values related to each of the 4 topic areas. Collectively, outcomes will
   provide a comprehensive picture of preschoolers' daily life and inform
   intervention design and strategies to enhance preschoolers' eating and
   activity behaviors in the home environment.},

Abstract = {Background Easy identification of immunocompromised hosts (ICHs) would
   allow for stratification of culture results based on host type. Methods
   We utilized antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) team notes written
   during handshake stewardship rounds in the pediatric intensive care unit
   (PICU) as the gold standard for host status; clinical notes from the
   primary team, medication orders during the encounter, problem list, and
   billing diagnoses documented prior to the ASP documentation were
   extracted to develop models that predict host status. We calculated
   performance for three models based on diagnoses/medications, with and
   without natural language processing from clinical notes. The
   susceptibility of pathogens causing bacteremia to commonly used empiric
   antibiotic regimens was then stratified by host status. Results We
   identified 844 antimicrobial episodes from 666 unique patients; 160
   (18.9\%) were identified as ICHs. We randomly selected 675 initiations
   (80\%) for model training and 169 initiations (20\%) for testing. A
   rule-based model using diagnoses and medications alone yielded a
   sensitivity of 0.87 (08.6-0.88), specificity of 0.93 (0.92-0.93), and
   positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.74 (0.73-0.75). Adding clinical
   notes into XGBoost model led to improved specificity of 0.98 (0.98-0.98)
   and PPV of 0.9 (0.88-0.91), but with decreased sensitivity 0.77
   (0.76-0.79). There were 77 bacteremia episodes during the study period
   identified and a host-specific visualization was created. Conclusions An
   electronic health record-based phenotype based on notes, diagnoses, and
   medications identifies ICH in the PICU with high specificity.},
