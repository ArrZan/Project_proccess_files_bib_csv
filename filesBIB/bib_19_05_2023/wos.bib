Abstract = {This paper highlights the importance of human resources in the
   performance of Kosovo exporting SMEs. Due to its fragile past, Kosovo
   has suffered greatly from both economic and human resources
   underdevelopment. In the late 1990s, the European Union (EU) began to
   promote trade liberalization in order to bring about regional
   reconciliation in the Western Balkan region. SMEs in Kosovo need to
   develop their competitiveness in order to increase their exports.
   Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of human
   resource characteristics such as the number of employees, education
   level, and attendance of training related to exports on the level of
   exports of 100 Kosovo SMEs. The Probit model is used to derive
   statistical results. Statistical analysis is conducted based on
   descriptive statistics, Reliability Test - Cronbach's Alpha-, Pseudo R2,
   LR chi2, the Prob>chi2 and Wald test. It can be concluded that this
   research will be of interest for the field of Human Resources Management
   as well as the scientific community in developing countries such as
   Kosovo. The main conclusion of the paper is that human resources of
   Kosovo exporting SMEs do not have the necessary expertise and
   contemporary knowledge regarding international trade.},

Title = {Determinants of competitiveness of the Czech SMEs: findings from the
   global competitiveness project},
Journal = {COMPETITIVENESS REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {361-378},
Month = {MAY 21},
Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to examine the firm-level drivers of
   competitiveness of the Czech small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
   using the complex firm-level competitiveness index. The authors explored
   the relationship between firm competitiveness and firm characteristics
   such as size, age, industry affiliation and location.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The complex competitiveness index as a proxy for firm competitiveness
   was calculated from the survey data. In total, 132 complete
   questionnaires filled in by representatives of randomly selected Czech
   SMEs were collected in 2018. Additional firm characteristics (size, age,
   industry affiliation and location) considered as determinants of
   competitiveness were obtained from the commercial database Albertina and
   from the Czech Statistical Office. The determinants of competitiveness
   were tested econometrically by estimation of multivariate regression
   models.
   Findings
   The authors mainly found a significant relationship between the firm
   size and competitiveness of the Czech SMEs. The authors have also
   confirmed that the least competitive enterprises are those operating in
   the agricultural sector and that regional location plays an important
   role in the determination of firm competitiveness.
   Practical implications
   The identification of competitiveness drivers can provide entrepreneurs,
   managers and policymakers with important implications. It seems
   beneficial for the Czech SMEs to expand the scope of operations to
   achieve a larger company size, for example, by focussing on investment
   activities, direct marketing, improving entrepreneurial skills or by
   applying an aggressive sales strategy, especially towards markets with
   lower competition. Politicians may respond to these efforts by setting
   the appropriate policies that promote SMEs' competitiveness, for
   example, through the hard and soft public support for financial and
   human resources.
   Originality/value
   Although many studies on competitiveness have been published, there is
   still a limited number of firm-level studies looking at competitiveness
   from multiple angles rather than from the study of profitability and
   productivity. In contrast, the study uses a complex firm-level
   competitiveness index based on ten competitiveness pillars (technology,
   human capital, products, domestic market, networks, international
   markets, online presence, marketing, decision making and strategy) to
   capture the contribution of different resources and capabilities to firm
   competitiveness.},

Abstract = {Purpose Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in
   sustainable development. Indeed, national and international governments
   call for urgent transformations into sustainable development, where
   firms are affected and affecting this situation. However, recent
   evidence has shown that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
   present low interest, commitment and maturation levels on
   sustainability; they seem to neglect and question the actual impact of
   transforming sustainability as a priority in their operations. Thus,
   this paper aims to measure the impact of sustainability on
   competitiveness in SMEs. Design/methodology/approach This is empirical
   research on sustainability and competitiveness in SMEs with a
   quantitative approach through structural equation modeling. Three
   hundred twenty-five surveys were applied to SMEs' manufacturing,
   construction, trade and services, operating in Mexico. Before measuring
   variables' multiple correlations, tests were carried out to establish
   the validity and reliability of the model. The data collection,
   validation and analysis were carried out with statistical package for
   social sciences and analysis of moment structures. Findings The results
   indicate a significant positive effect of SMEs' sustainability on
   competitiveness. The adjusted measurement model shows validity and
   reliability through the various tests applied. Thus, firms should not
   view sustainability as detrimental to their competitiveness.
   Originality/value Because firms are crucial in the urgent sustainability
   transformation, recent research has shown their low commitment and
   maturation to sustainability. This research's originality empirically
   measures and demonstrates sustainability's impact on SMEs'
   competitiveness. Therefore, empirically testing this impact becomes
   essential and original to provide better insights into SMEs' needs to be
   uncovered, prioritied and done in their specific and evolving contexts.},

   determinants of the adoption of HR practices, 4) their impact on the
   performance of SMEs, and (5) the processes through which HR practices
   are modified. The results show that the main focus of the studies was to
   verify whether large enterprises HRM model applies to SMEs. The

   few studies have been done on the various aspects of HRM and their
   results are conflicting. Several research directions are proposed.},

Title = {The Effectiveness of Kano-QFD Approach to Enhance Competitiveness of
   Technology-Based SMEs through Transfer Intention Model},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Despite the value of QFD (Quality Function Deployment), it has been
   applied to individual industries, or only to large companies with
   sufficient QFD-related human resources and sufficient financial
   resources. Most SMEs, which account for 80\% of the world economy, have
   not been able to benefit from QFD, the tool designed to revamp the
   growth, due to the lack of financial and human resources to implement
   QFD and Kano Model. This paper is brought to assess the effectiveness of
   Kano-QFD approach for technology-based SMEs through the transfer
   intention model. In order to verify the effectiveness of the above
   approach, 860 technology-based SMEs in their establishment 3-7 years are
   researched for the learning transfer intention after the completion of
   Kano QFD education and training program. The results of this study are
   that the perceived content validity has the direct effect on learning
   transfer intention simultaneously with the partial mediating effect
   through the self-efficacy factor. The learner readiness does not
   directly influence the learning transfer intention and the self-efficacy
   completely mediates the learner readiness and the transfer intention.
   This research contributes to providing critical implications for the
   educators and training planners in in private sector as well as policy
   makers of technology-based SMEs in the public sector.},

Abstract = {Thanks to their dominant role in fostering socioeconomic prosperity,
   exporting small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are perceived to be
   a major societal asset. Coming out of the great financial crisis,
   initiatives to nurture their (export) competitiveness have been high on
   the political agenda. In this vein, a growing literature explores the
   pertinence of firm-specific factors for explaining differences in SMEs'
   export behavior. However, the puzzle of how intangible, knowledge-based
   assets, such as human and relational capital, contribute to establishing
   a viable position in export markets remains. By synthesizing empirical
   evidence from 167 studies, this meta-analytic path analysis reveals
   significant differential direct and indirect effects of human and
   relational capital endowment on dimensions of export behavior.
   Concurrently, our analysis uncovered that positive influences of
   intangible assets are context-dependent. In fact, human resources appear
   to be particularly pertinent for exporting SMEs in developing economies.},

Abstract = {Labor shortages have become widespread in Slovakia in recent years.
   Numerous studies deal with the difficulties of finding a skilled,
   motivated workforce and the difficulties of retantion. The aim of this
   study is to introduce the tools used by managers in HR with special
   regard in examining the efforts companies make to prevent burnout. The
   study provides a statistical analysis of the results of primary data
   collection on a sample of 431 SMEs the current employment policy issues
   in Slovakia, with a particular focus on recruitment, motivation and
   retention. SMEs are the engine of the European Economy, which is why it
   is very important that this machinery works well, is able to produce
   continuously and thus contribute to the economic development of the
   country. One of the prerequisites for this is that the human resources
   available to them are properly managed. Our goal is to showcase the
   opportunities and tools that a manager or HR department uses when it
   comes to employing a company, and to try to find a solution for the
   problem of retaining an effective workforce. Based on the obtained data
   related to burnout syndrome, we can conclude that 76.38\% of the
   surveyed companies address the issue of employee burnout. 86\% of the
   employees are at risk of burnout, since burnout is the diesease of our
   modern civilization. 68\% of the companies struggle with more than a
   15\% workforce fluctuation, which can be declared a loss for the
   company.},

Abstract = {Guided by a resource-based theory, this study is the first one that
   takes a quantitative approach to identify determinants of
   competitiveness of women-owned small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in
   Vietnam. The study employs time series data of Vietnamese SMEs extracted
   from the Vietnam Small and Medium Enterprises Survey conducted
   biennially from 2005 to 2015 in ten Vietnamese provinces. Firm
   competitiveness hereby is indicated by revenue, market share,
   profitability, and export volume. The research reveals a number of
   determining factors, of all, research and development, labor skills,
   business environment, technology investment are the most important
   factors, followed by capital and headcount. It is indicated that the
   determining factors have different influences on competitiveness
   obtained by different measurements. Therefore, it is based on specific
   targets and situations to make wise business decisions. The authors also
   make comparisons among groups of women-owned enterprises divided by
   their firm age, location, ownership, export, age, and educational
   background of business owners. The findings serve as critical empirical
   evidence and provide policy recommendations for improving the
   competitiveness of women-owned SMEs in Vietnam. The recommendations
   range from technology support, education and professional support for
   female entrepreneurs, access to capital and human resources to business
   environment improvement.},

Title = {Effect of ITC on the international competitiveness of firms},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT DECISION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {50},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1045-1061},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper's aim is to evaluate the effect of the use of
   information technology and communications (ITC) on the international
   competitiveness of firms in developing countries. The study also seeks
   to evaluate other factors that allow or condition the use of ITC such
   as: human resources, collaboration of the industrial sector, and local
   environment.
   Design/methodology/approach - These effects are examined through an
   empirical research of 100 small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from
   a developing country Peru.
   Findings - SMEs from developing countries follow an isomorphic approach.
   This is because they tend to imitate or copy the better practices from
   developed countries. The results have shown that ITCs have a positive
   effect on the international competitiveness of firms.
   Research limitations/implications - A limitation is the cross-sectional
   character of this research.
   Practical implications - Firms use ITC to manage their inventory, for
   the communication between manufacturers and offices, and suppliers, for
   bill payments, and for the management of sales and marketing, and for
   the management of their networks.
   Originality/value - According to the literature reviewed, this study is
   one of the pioneers in contrasting empirically whether the use of ITC
   contributes positively to the international competitiveness of firms in
   the developing countries of Latin America.},

Abstract = {In recent years, open innovation (OI) has attracted much attention in
   innovation management research. Although showing signs of advance, most
   of the existing literature still relies, to a great extent, on case
   studies and conceptual frameworks, with little empirical research in the
   specific context of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This paper adds
   to the literature by empirically assessing the effects of organizational
   antecedents and innovation climate on OI as well as its consequences on
   firm performance in SMEs. In addition, the moderating roles of
   environmental dynamisms and competitiveness in the relationships between
   innovation climate and inbound and outbound OI are analyzed. To achieve
   these goals, this paper develops an integrative research model, which
   analyses the network relations using covariance-based structural
   equation modeling (SEM) on a data set of 429 Spanish SMEs. Results
   revealed that organizational factors such as commitment-based human
   resources practices have a positive influence on innovation climate and
   that innovation climate contributes to both inbound and outbound OI.
   Another important finding is that contingent factors such as
   environmental dynamism strengthen the positive effect of innovation
   climate on outbound OI. The main conclusions of this research can be
   valuable to SMEs that implement or intend to implement OI. (C) 2017

   AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {67-75},
Abstract = {Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are today considered a very
   important pillar of economic growth in many countries. These companies
   account for 80\% of global economic growth, employ the largest
   percentage of the workforce and contribute to income generation.
   However, although they represent a very important factor in today's
   business these businesses face a number of challenges as they are
   constantly under pressure to maintain their own competitiveness both in
   the domestic and global markets. One of the key sources of survival of
   small and medium enterprises and building a sustainable competitive
   advantage are considered innovations. They usually start with innovative
   ideas and innovative activities that lead to improvement in the overall
   performance of the company. In addition to improving product quality and
   reducing costs, innovation also allows for increased efficiency and
   sales for the organization. Innovation is a process that must take place
   continuously. The implementation of innovative culture in companies must
   include all segments of the company and help to create good conditions
   for the development of creative individuals.
   Croatia is a country that belongs to the group of moderate innovators,
   however, as innovation is today a key factor in the success of all
   companies, this paper investigates the influence of human resources and
   leadership on innovation in small and medium-sized companies in Croatia.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the following research problem was addressed: Is there a
   significant economic impact of multidimensional specified
   competitiveness within the EU (28) countries on the competitive business
   environment, human development, and sustainable growth? Based on the
   mentioned research problem, we formulated the aim of paper: To detect
   the significant interrelations among the assessment of global
   competitiveness, business environment as well as human development in
   the EU (28) countries for the period of 2006-2017. To address these
   problems, the methodology of global multi-criteria indices, namely the
   global competitiveness index (GCI), doing business index (DBI), and
   human development index (HDI), as well as panel analysis and non-linear
   regression analyses with ANOVA, were applied. The panel analysis results
   suggest that there is a direct linear relationship between the GCI and
   HDI. Moreover, the impact of the DBI on the change in the GCI score was
   not confirmed. We identified the main areas of countries' interest, and
   important economic and statistical significant relations of
   competitiveness by creating three models: The GD model (constructed by
   GCI and DBI scores), GH model (GCI and HDI scores), and GDH model (GCI,
   DBI and HDI scores). Based on the results, all interrelations were
   confirmed. However, the highest extent of variability for the
   explanation of the selected data was recorded in the case of the GDH
   model (87.12\%). We detected the impact of the business environment and
   human resources as competitive advantages on global macroeconomic
   competitiveness. As the business sector in EU (28) countries is
   represented mainly by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),
   enterprise activities play a key role in the process of sustainable
   competitive economic development. Moreover, human resources are
   considered to be another important driver of the internationalization of
   European SMEs.},

Abstract = {The 21st century is the century of change and maybe one of the most
   important changes in the organizations' life is the transition from
   focusing on the development of the tangible assets to the development of
   the intangible assets and the interest for attracting human resources
   capable to generate performance. The survival of many companies depends
   on their willingness and capacity to adapt to such changes. (Abdulaali,
   2018) In this dynamic and complex economic system, the intangible assets
   of organizations become primary, being decisive for the organizations'
   performance. In the new economic competition, intangible assets provide
   a sustainable competitive advantage, intellectual capital and intangible
   assets representing the key factor in company profitability and success.
   In the knowledge based society, intellectual capital has more value for
   organizations than tangible assets and knowledge becomes a permanent
   source of competitiveness (Bhatti, Zaheer, 2014). It is considered by
   specialists a valuable and strategic resource, since the success of
   organizations depends on creating, discovering, storing, disseminating,
   measuring and developing knowledge. The main objective of the research
   presented in this paper is to offer an overview on the specific problems
   and needs of the entrepreneurs financed through the Romania Start-up
   Plus programme, part of Start-UP Hub: The Entrepreneurs Laboratory Cod
   SIMS: 105648. A primary target of this research is to examine the
   components of intellectual capital and the way in which the intellectual
   capital influences the small business performance. The majority of the
   researchers agree that intellectual capital is directly connected to the
   performance of the SMEs sector. The results of our analysis shows the
   fact that intangible assets influence business development in various
   ways, such as increasing competitive advantage, expanding employee
   competency and improving organizational performance.},

Abstract = {To pursue the high environmental performance, economic and social
   effectiveness of the companies, including small and medium enterprises
   (SMEs), is the key goal of the sustainable development concept.
   Sustainable development is based on preventive management principles,
   and their application in SMEs has become an important issue for
   enhancing competitiveness. Unfortunately, most of the sustainable
   development-related research is focused on large companies rather than
   SMEs, especially in the industrial sector. The importance of SMEs often
   remains unnoticed. Besides, SMEs themselves often have inadequate
   knowledge about their environmental and social impacts and management,
   and apply voluntary preventive measures less frequently than large
   companies. To make sustainable decisions and to improve the
   environmental performance, economic and social effectiveness of SMEs, an
   integrated sustainable management system (SMS) based on financial
   analysis is necessary, oriented to strategic sustainability goals, not
   requiring significant financial and human resources. Integration of
   sustainability management accounting and composite sustainable
   development index methodologies forms the basis of SMS for SMEs decision
   making. SMS was applied in three pilot SMEs (small-scale wood parquet,
   medium-scale wood pallets, medium-scale beverage producing companies).
   In this article, an extensive analysis of a small-scale wood parquet
   manufacturing company's case is presented. The application of SMS
   enabled to identify key sustainability problems and to find solutions to
   improve the companies' sustainability performance. SMS application
   resulted in reduced input materials consumption and the reduction of
   sustainability costs.},

Title = {OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF BUSINESS MODELS
   IN SMES},
Journal = {ECONOMICS \& SOCIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {159-171},
Abstract = {The importance of business models for small and medium-sized enterprises
   (SMEs) in terms of their competitiveness and sustainability is
   undoubtedly growing. The global Covid-19 pandemic even strengthens this
   trend. The degree of digitalization of corporate processes becomes the
   SME stability and development limitation. The paper submitted presents
   the results of research focused on the issue of digital transformation
   of business models on a test sample of 496 SMEs (out of which 214
   operate in the manufacturing sector and industry and 218 are included in
   the services sector) using the method of dimensionality reduction and
   logit regression. The main output from the solution valid for both
   tested sectors is considered insufficient setting, management and
   evaluation of corporate processes. This applies to the main
   value-creating processes (input and output logistics, production,
   marketing and sales, service and other ancillary services) and
   supporting processes (purchase, scientific and technological
   development, human resources management and company infrastructure). In
   terms of the achieved degree of process digitization, an imbalance was
   found between the main value-creating processes and supporting
   processes. Investment in value-creating and supporting corporate
   processes are not considered an important factor for any of the sectors
   due to the high sensitivity of investments to the size and
   specialization of companies. In contrast, the higher perceived need for
   value chain digitization in both tested sectors, especially in the case
   of manufacturing and industry, is considered a very positive output.
   This proves the need for the digital transformation of companies and its
   positive impact on their profitability and competitiveness.},

Abstract = {In this paper we address Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as a
   competitive factor in textile and fashion value chain. CSR assumes a
   large range of activities focused on one or multiple targets, from work
   conditions to social programs, or environmental impact. The influence of
   CSR strategies on market performance depend on how truthful consumers
   will understand and believe to be the values offered by companies. The
   qualitative research has considered seven case studies from Portuguese
   textiles and fashion companies. We have found that a major obstacle to
   SMEs was the cost of CSR programs and their internal and external
   communication. As a rule, SMEs have small financial investment
   capabilities and their human resources tend to be scarce and not
   available to engage more responsibilities. Moreover, managers argue they
   compete in the market with companies that have low production as well as
   low social and environmental costs. If CSR strategies establish a set of
   clear and transparent practices, consumers will be able to compare
   across world suppliers, will result in additional costs and clients are
   not willing to pay for. The development of an accreditation system, able
   to clearly establish the reality of CSR practices within companies, is
   an important contribution to the implementation of CSR strategies into
   the textile and clothing sectors. The researchers have developed a
   system that can be managed step-by-step, and implemented progressively
   as companies receive and evaluate market feedback. The system introduces
   a clear communication about the company's actions and commitment to CSR,
   resulting in an unique label, capable of stating to whom it may concern,
   the company' present situation and its development year after year.},

   management process in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and to
   compare these findings with the conclusions of other research studies
   designed for SMEs and to examine the level of formality in knowledge
   management processes according to the size of enterprise. As well, to
   propose a model suited to the characteristics of the small business. The
   information is collected from 22 Basque Country SMEs grouped into
   industrial clusters, through a survey that is conducted to identify the
   use of practices related to knowledge management. Results show that
   informal practices figure prominently in the day to day of the SME and
   that the knowledge management process is not standardized but that is
   performed by the collaborative work between people, among others.
   Besides, the size of the SME acts as a factor in regard to the level of
   formality in knowledge management process. This study helps SME managers
   understand where the organizational knowledge is found within
   organizations and, consequently, to not neglect the importance of people
   in keeping competitiveness high. The article provides new information on
   how firms located in a particular region of Spain perform in relation to
   knowledge management, and it could be considered a sort of benchmarking
   practice on the behavior of SME in managing knowledge, which will be
   useful for the organization when taking management decisions. (C) 2015

Abstract = {Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have developed a marketing
   capability that differs from the conventional one. Most of the
   Literature has neglected marketing innovation, because it is considered
   an accident or implicit in other types of activities, and only recently
   it has been associated with competitiveness. The aim of this research
   was to verify the relationship of marketing innovation with the integral
   performance of SMEs, and their possible implications. Through the
   structural equations modeling, the effects of this innovation on
   business performance were estimated. The findings revealed its
   significant influence to guide business performance, by implementing new
   concepts and means of promotion, new methods of commercialization, and
   modifications to its packaging, influencing mostly in the commercial
   part, but also affecting the administrative, financial and human
   resources scope.},

Abstract = {Safety in the sustainable construction is a game with uncertain reality,
   with human's life. Managers in power, involved in the construction
   project life cycle, create rules for the game and are the main players.
   The project's success can be perceived differently by stakeholders. A
   company's competitiveness, successful implementation of the projects and
   effective safety management depends on the strategic allocation of its
   human resources in order to select a proper project team in alignment
   with employee capabilities. This requires detailed factors reflecting
   their role (in line with their interests and attitudes) and knowing
   which of them has a decisive influence on the successful implementation
   of the project. The real data describing key factors in this concept can
   be provided as uncertain conditions. This work presents a novel
   integrated modified fuzzy group decision-making approach to select and
   rank the most influential persons ensuring the sustainable prevention of
   accidents at work in the small and medium-sized construction
   enterprises. This model includes the Delphi method and fuzzy extensions
   of Eckenrode's criteria rating method. The proposed model could be
   expanded in order to select the most suitable individuals for
   sustainable management of safety and, moreover, for the effective
   implementation of safety and health measures.},

Abstract = {We have conducted a broad statistical research on Romanian small to
   medium enterprises (SMEs), with the goal of better understanding: (1)
   the incipient organizational culture of a recently-opened East European
   market; and (2) the role of leadership in increasing the competitiveness
   of SMEs. The paper studies the perceived characteristics of a leader and
   their influence on the organization's results (as seen by employees),
   and it tries to reveal the subliminal inter-correlations among these
   characteristics. The method is factor analysis (implemented in SPSS),
   for a questionnaire with 23 items, answered by 930 subjects on a
   five-point Likert scale. The six factors identified by our analysis
   were: adaptability; cooperation; authority; charisma; confidence;
   motivation. By highlighting these basic components, our study aims both
   at increasing competitiveness in Romanian enterprises and at designing
   better training programs for managers and entrepreneurs acting on East
   European markets, adapted to the real characteristics of these young
   economic environments.},

Abstract = {Quality human resources are an integral part of corporate strategy.
   Human capital development is an essential step towards the success of
   the business on the market. This paper fills the hole by providing the
   information about the ways how to motivate employees in terms of
   occupational classification and the age. The aim of the research was to
   determine whether there are statistically significant differences in the
   level of importance of employee motivation in terms of occupational
   classification and the age of respondents and the studied areas of
   motivation. A total of 3720 employees in small and medium-sized
   enterprises were analysed all over Slovakia using the method of simple
   random sampling. Descriptive statistics were used to describe sampling
   units. The differences in the values of the importance of motivation
   factors of individual groups were tested using the method of Tukey's HSD
   at the level of significance = 5\%. Following the results, the fact that
   there are significant differences in terms of occupational
   classification and the age in the analysed areas of motivation can be
   stated. Therefore, the managers have to motivate employees in different
   ways that result in the more complicated management of human resources
   associated with meeting enterprise goals. Thus, the issue of individual
   motivation programmes created for individual employees tailored to
   employees' needs must be discussed.},

Abstract = {Using a multinomial logit model with the panel-data set of Vietnam
   manufacturing firms, this paper investigates the impacts of foreign
   direct investment (FDI) - small and medium enterprises (SMEs) linkages
   and other factors on SMEs' participation in the global value chain
   (GVC). We consider GVC firms are those engaging in any of the three
   modes including (i) using domestic inputs to export (D2E), (ii) using
   imported inputs to produce for the domestic market (I2P), (iii) using
   imported inputs to export (I2E). We discover that FDI-SME linkages
   statistically encourage Vietnamese SMEs to integrate into the GVC via
   I2P and I2E, while no statistical association between FDI-SME linkage
   and D2E participation is found. GVCs participation likelihood is also
   positively correlated with the introduction of new product introduction.
   The establishment of firms' production facilities in industrial zones
   and foreign ownership are both reported to be significantly decisive
   factors to SMEs' decisions on GVC participation. Besides, there is a
   strong association between firms' attributes, i.e. employment, capital
   intensity as well as financial access, and their participation in the
   GVC. Local governance quality (proxied by the Provincial Competitiveness
   Index) and the share of skilled labor at the province-level can
   facilitate firms' integration into GVCs, while greater market
   concentration may be a hurdle to such potential.},

Title = {A bottom-up approach for implementation of Environmental Product
   Declarations in Mexico's housing sector},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},

Abstract = {Purpose After analyzing in previous papers the potential of
   Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) as a sustainability tool in
   Mexico's building sector and studying its implementation mainly from
   government housing programs and normative instruments (a top-down
   approach), this work seeks to complement a holistic approach about its
   implementation in an emerging country like Mexico. So, the main
   objective of this paper is to analyze the possibilities of EPDs
   implementation in Mexico's housing sector from the business sector (a
   bottom-up approach), determining the possible challenges this approach
   would have. Methods The experience, vision, and perspective about EPDs
   from the main potential users of this ecolabel in Mexico have been
   considered. For this, a questionnaire to housing developers and Mexican
   companies implementing EPDs has been applied. Similar studies from
   developed countries have been used as a reference to establish a
   possible path for the EPD development in a business sector of a country
   like Mexico. Based on this analysis, an outlook and challenges for a
   bottom-up EPD implementation in Mexico's housing sector has been made.
   Results and discussion Reduce the environmental impact and increase the
   commercial competitiveness are two of the main reasons for companies to
   implement sustainability strategies. Although EPDs serve these
   objectives, and there are Mexican standards, normative instruments, and
   housing design guides recommending the use of this ecolabel, there are
   few housing developers knowing EPDs, and there are also few Mexican
   companies implementing this ecolabel. Moreover, there is limited
   knowledge about EPDs in Mexico, both by final consumers and professional
   buyers. On the other hand, the European benchmark has served to detect
   common aspects about the EPD implementation, as well as to establish a
   possible development path that can be used to accelerate its
   implementation by Mexican companies. Conclusions In Mexico, there is a
   solid legislative and regulatory framework that can be used as a
   starting point to promote the EPDs in housing sector. There is also a
   widespread interest from companies in using ecolabels as part of its
   sustainability strategies. However, there is still not enough
   supply-demand for this kind of information, nor the technical and
   personnel capacity supporting the EPD implementation. Consolidate the
   human resources formation in life cycle assessment (LCA), inform about
   the EPD's usefulness, and facilitate the understanding of such
   information to consumers and professional buyers would be the main
   challenges to promote this ecolabel in Mexico.},

Title = {DEFINING THE NOTIONS OF MANAGEMENT OF SUPPLY CHAINS, VALUE CHAINS AND

Abstract = {Supply chain management as a new business philosophy in today's
   competitive conditions is a source of numerous advantages for those
   enterprises that apply it. Due to its dynamic structure, it is a much
   wider term than that of logistics management, because it encompasses the
   process of conceiving, developing, optimizing and managing internal and
   external components of acquisition, transformation of material and
   distribution of finished products or services in accordance with the
   business strategic goals. The aim of the supply chain management is the
   creation of as great a value as possible for all value chain
   participants, especially for the final consumer, as he is at the end of
   the system of value creation and he validates the quality of supply
   chain via his purchase. When all enterprises-participants in the supply
   chain - do their business separately and act on their own separate
   business strategies, the sum of their expenses surpasses the expenses
   generated by integrated business of these enterprises within the supply
   chain. It is precisely because of this fact that, when an enterprise
   creates a unique system of goods and information flow with other members
   of the chain, it in fact enhances the efficiency of managing the entire
   chain. In that way, the value of the whole system increases for the
   consumer and competitive advantage of the chain is created. Since the
   clusters occur by connecting enterprises or chains of new value
   creation, the rest of this paper explains the meeting points between
   cluster concept and supply chain concept respectively, with special
   emphasis on agricultural clusters. The basic idea was that agricultural
   clusters are a geographical concentration of mutually connected SMEs,
   specialized suppliers and service providers, companies in related
   businesses, scientific and educational institutions, and government
   bodies and agencies in the sectors of agriculture and rural development.
   Therefore, the network of interdependent enterprises (individual
   agricultural farmsteads), within agricultural clusters and related
   institutions, confirms that within every cluster there are numerous
   supply chains, that is, that the supply chain management is an integral
   part and an indispensable factor of a cluster. At the same time, there
   is a complementarity and symbiosis between the concept of supply chain
   management and cluster concept, that is, their combination can
   effectively advance the competitive advantage both of the enterprises
   (individual agricultural farmsteads) and consequently regional and
   national economic competitiveness. The geographical proximity of cluster
   participants enables a more efficient access to specialized resources,
   information, human resources, institutions, and trainings; facilitates
   the coordination of activities within enterprises (individual
   agricultural farmsteads) as well as among cluster members; creates
   larger possibilities for innovation; stimulates permanent comparison of
   performances and of creating more successful business models, so-called
   best practices; and contributes to the commercialization of products and
   services and entering the new markets, as well as creating of new
   enterprises (individual agricultural farmsteads). More specifically,
   doing business in a cluster environment stimulates the competitiveness
   of enterprises (individual agricultural farmsteads) and affects the
   promotion of supply chain management within enterprises (individual
   agricultural farmsteads).},

Abstract = {Family businesses are present in every economy, whether they are given
   special attention or remain a general part of the strategic segment. In
   Slovakia, despite the dominance of family businesses, not enough
   attention is paid to them. The main objective of the paper is to
   identify the key internal determinants that affect the management,
   sustainability and development of Slovak family businesses. Current
   information on the researched issue has been obtained through empirical
   research in practice. The research was evaluated using statistical
   hypothesis testing methods (Binomial test and Mann-Whitney U test).
   While verifying the hypotheses, the statistical software STATISTICA 12,
   was used. The results of the study led to conclusions that extend the
   current knowledge in family businesses in Slovakia. The achieved results
   showed that the key internal determinants influencing the development of
   family businesses in Slovakia are: management, human resources, finances
   and narrow specialization of the supply, especially on the Slovak
   market.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyze the main streams of literature
   pertaining to HR systems development in start-ups or SME-se and to
   identify the main approaches chosen by entrepreneurs and managers in the
   early stages of the business development cycle. For the purpose of this
   study, literature review has been conducted with particular focus on
   high-quality journals with a proven influence in the HRM and Innovation
   field. Concerning the research strategy, 23 papers published in Q1 and
   Q2 ranked journals (SJR) were analyzed, as well as 6 other sources
   inlcuding books, books proceedings and journals (not ranked in Scopus or
   WoS databases). Our findings support the development of an integrated
   approach that not only takes into account early investment into HR
   systems, but also considers how macroeconomic factors might influence
   the industry directly, and start-ups indirectly and incongruously. This
   integrated perspective maintains that human capital acquisition and the
   implementation of adequate HR policies and practices that support
   employee engagement and retention early on are significantly more
   beneficial to company performance and productivity in the longer run;
   whereas, at the same time exhibiting a high degree of flexibility and
   adaptability to business-and sector-specific preconditions and
   requirements. We argue that future research should concentrate on the
   industry as a factor determining the HR strategy to be adopted by
   start-ups, as opposed to debating which approach is more appropriate for
   start-ups without taking into account their operational environment.},

Abstract = {Broadband network deployment plays an important part in the strategic
   policies in Europe to promote growth and innovation in all sectors of
   the economy in addition to social and territorial cohesion. In
   compliance with existing community policies, Romanian strategies in this
   field seek to provide the necessary support for broadband connectivity
   in rural areas. The goal of this study is to define a rural end-user
   profile to plan the most appropriate broadband service strategy from
   both a technical and a marketing perspective. Our empirical research
   involves an exploratory survey conducted in rural areas in northwestern
   Romania (n=1040 respondents). The findings reveal low levels of customer
   satisfaction and users more interested in data transfer than voice or
   video applications. Given this rural user profile, simulations of
   network traffic were conducted. The simulation results suggest that
   WLANs are the most suitable solution for the ``last mile{''} broadband
   segment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
