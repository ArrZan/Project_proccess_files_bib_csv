abstract={In recent years, open innovation (OI) has attracted much attention in innovation management research. Although showing signs of advance, most of the existing literature still relies, to a great extent, on case studies and conceptual frameworks, with little empirical research in the specific context of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This paper adds to the literature by empirically assessing the effects of organizational antecedents and innovation climate on OI as well as its consequences on firm performance in SMEs. In addition, the moderating roles of environmental dynamisms and competitiveness in the relationships between innovation climate and inbound and outbound OI are analyzed. To achieve these goals, this paper develops an integrative research model, which analyses the network relations using covariance-based structural equation modeling (SEM) on a data set of 429 Spanish SMEs. Results revealed that organizational factors such as commitment-based human resources practices have a positive influence on innovation climate and that innovation climate contributes to both inbound and outbound OI. Another important finding is that contingent factors such as environmental dynamism strengthen the positive effect of innovation climate on outbound OI. The main conclusions of this research can be valuable to SMEs that implement or intend to implement OI. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Currently, there is general agreement about the importance of training as a tool to help companies in the development of sustainable competitive advantages based on their human resources. However, the investment of companies in training activities is still very low. Among other reasons, that is due to the fact that they do not evaluate the effects of training on performance and therefore they do not know its economic impact for the company. There is also a lack of academic research analysing that issue, mainly at the empirical level. This paper studies empirically the effects of training on performance (effectiveness and profitability) using a sample of 457 European SMEs (including Spanish companies). Our results show some evidence of significant relationships between training and performance.},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze different challenges for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in India and China following globalization. It aims to describe the status of these enterprises and examine the roles of government policies and strategy development for competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire-based survey was conducted, which produced 241 valid responses. Of these, 80 percent were from SMEs. Statistical analysis of the data acquired from survey used a reliability test, t-test and correlation analysis. A relevant literature review pinpoints salient issues in the environment of the SMEs. Findings - The governments of China and India have launched various promotional schemes for SMEs. Various challenges for SMEs in these countries are similar; however, the rate of growth is different. Indian SMEs give more attention to supplier development, total productive maintenance and the organization's culture. Chinese SMEs pay more attention to relationship management and cost reduction. Human resource development and quality improvement are also highly correlated with competitiveness. Research limitations/implications - SMEs should focus on developing their human resources and improving product quality. This effort will help SMEs retain human capital as well as increase the demand for their products. Similar studies could explore Chinese SMEs in-depth for additional comparisons. Originality/value - This paper will help SMEs in shaping their competitive strategies and policy formulation by respective governments. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The concept of the circular economy (CE) is currently gaining impetus as a way to move towards sustainable, low-carbon, resource-efficient, and competitive economies. However, despite the potential benefits of CE activities, their implementation remains relatively rare. We use a cross-sectional survey of European small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) to identify the main barriers firms face to promote the CE, focusing specifically on the following: those related to a lack of resources (human and financial) and capabilities (expertise) and those related to the regulatory framework (administrative procedures and the costs of meeting the regulations). Our results indicate that it is the complexity of administrative/legal procedures and the costs of meeting regulations/legal standards that constitute the most significant barriers, whereas the lack of human resources is also perceived to be an obstacle by firms engaged in CE activities. Those obstacles may be considered revealed barriers, and it is only when the firms become involved in these activities that they actually perceive them. Furthermore, when we consider the breadth of CE activities, administrative procedures and regulations once again emerge as the most significant obstacles. Finally, we stress the need to distinguish between different CE activities given that the perception of barriers differs substantially across these activities. Firms undertaking a disruptive innovation redesigning products and services to minimize the use of materials are more likely to perceive all barriers as important. However, firms implementing such activities as minimizing waste, replanning energy usage, and using renewable energy only perceive those obstacles related to administrative procedures and regulations. © 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={This study attempts to understand the extent of e-HRM practised in the small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in the manufacturing sector in five main areas of human capital management, which is believed to have a significant impact on the competitiveness of the industry, namely, recruitment, compensation and benefits, training and development, communication and performance appraisal. The piece will also focus on the fact that the readiness and feasibility of implementing e-HRM in the SMEs in Malaysia is dependent on the availability of resources and the attitude of the employees. The resources covered in this study include expertise, financial and technical resources.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to provide a prologue to the issue of human resource development (HRD) and innovation which has been under-researched despite the widespread recognition of the critical role of innovation for sustained national, regional and organisational competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach – The paper provides an overview of the evolution of innovation within the economic and management literatures. It then examines previous work on human resource management (HRM), HRD and innovation. The paper then provides a brief overview of the articles for this issue focussing on HRD and innovation. Findings – HRD interventions can positively contribute to organisation's innovation activities. HRD is also found to positively influence employee engagement, leadership, manager's motivation to learn, the promotion of a learning culture, and social capital development all of which are positively associated with innovation. Informal HRD and access to mentors and coaches is shown to be critical for innovation in SMEs. Originality/value – This paper provides an introduction to this special issue on HRD and innovation. It shows that this has been an under-researched area and it also emphasises that HRD and its relationship with innovation must be analysed within the context of the organisation's culture, its context, and its leadership capabilities. The four conceptual contributions provide a rich road map for future research on HRD and innovation. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract={The ability to attract and retain the talents is an important factor in the competitiveness of countries, as it is confirmed in our study. At the level of small and medium-sized enterprises, hiring and retaining skilled workers is one of the most difficult tasks of HR management, especially in transition economies with a high intensity of “leaching out” the skilled workers due to labour migration. Our research in Ukraine, which is a prime example of such countries, conducted via the cluster analysis allows us to conclude that the problems of hiring and retaining skilled workers have some connection with profitability: there is almost always a problem with filling vacancies with people of all educational levels in unprofitable enterprises, which is not typical of profitable businesses. The main problems with filling vacancies according to employers’ estimations are: 1) market factors – shortage of employees with the required skills; 2) internal problems of ensuring the attractiveness of jobs (material – pay, and intangible – career prospects, flexible working hours, legal employ-ment); 3) internal factors of inefficient HR management, including recruiting; 4) psycho-physiological factors of job satisfaction. However, there are no close links between the factors of hiring effectiveness and retention of skilled workers with the economic success of the organization in the form of the growth of assets, revenues and stuff. This leads to the conclusion that the practices of human resources management in small and medium-sized businesses in Ukraine are largely built chaotic, without analyzing the impact on the efficiency of the use of other resources and without providing links with the overall economic efficiency of enterprises. © 2020 The Author(s).

abstract={Safety in the sustainable construction is a game with uncertain reality, with human's life. Managers in power, involved in the construction project life cycle, create rules for the game and are the main players. The project's success can be perceived differently by stakeholders. A company's competitiveness, successful implementation of the projects and effective safety management depends on the strategic allocation of its human resources in order to select a proper project team in alignment with employee capabilities. This requires detailed factors reflecting their role (in line with their interests and attitudes) and knowing which of them has a decisive influence on the successful implementation of the project. The real data describing key factors in this concept can be provided as uncertain conditions. This work presents a novel integrated modified fuzzy group decision-making approach to select and rank the most influential persons ensuring the sustainable prevention of accidents at work in the small and medium-sized construction enterprises. This model includes the Delphi method and fuzzy extensions of Eckenrode's criteria rating method. The proposed model could be expanded in order to select the most suitable individuals for sustainable management of safety and, moreover, for the effective implementation of safety and health measures. © 2019.},

abstract={Computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) requires cross-functional co-operation, and involvement of employees in product and process development. A successful CIM initiative in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) must have top management involvement and commitment and a CIM compatible organizational infrastructure which includes requisite skills, appropriate training and education, and adequate incentives and rewards. Top management must commit the resources necessary to acquire needed technology and bring about any necessary changes in the organizational infrastructure. Top management must likewise be willing to accept the long-term consequences of their decisions. SMEs play an increasingly important role in the competitiveness of many industries in the areas of product and process innovation, flexibility, and in the development of innovative management methods, organizational conventions, and human resource practices. One of the ways that SMEs can achieve a competitive advantage in manufacturing is through the implementation of CIM. To promote a better understanding of organizational issues pertaining to the implementation of CIM in SMEs, a framework is proposed for use in examining and explaining the organizational ramifications of CIM. A literature review and an empirical study provide the foundation for the proposed framework.},

abstract={Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) play an increasingly important role in all aspects of competitiveness e.g. for both products and production techniques, but also management methods, the organisation of the firm and human resource training. Obtaining and, just as importantly, mastering scientific and technological information is therefore essential to competitiveness of all SMEs. During the last two decades, several factors have forced global manufacturers to make dramatic changes in their products, markets, and manufacturing strategies. One of the ways by which SMEs can achieve a competitive advantage in manufacturing is through the implementation of computer integrated manufacturing (CIM). Realising the importance of SMEs, an attempt has been made in this paper to study the implementation of CIM in SMEs. First, the characteristics of CIM have been studied with reference to the application and infrastructure of SMEs. Secondly, a framework has been presented for the implementation of CIM in SMEs with the help of a conceptual model. Finally, future research directions on CIM in SMEs are indicated.},

abstract={As the component of environmental scanning that is concerned with science and technology, products, production processes, hardware and information systems, the concept of technological scanning, especially in small business, has received little empirical attention in the past. This paper aims to better define the different technological scanning practices of small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) and identify the main factors that determine these differences. This is done without relation to organizational effectiveness as technological scanning is but one of many potential influences on business performance. Using data obtained from a mail survey on the scanning practices of 324 SMEs, the study hopes to increase our understanding of how various entrepreneurs confront various environments in practice. The research model used is based on the notion that, to define different technological scanning practices in small business, four aspects must be considered: strategic orientation (objectives pursued); types of information sought (on technologies and their costs, human resources necessary, etc.); sources used (customers, fairs, specialized publications, suppliers, research centres, etc.); and scanning management practices (methods used, staff involved, level of formalization, and integration of activities). These aspects are contingent upon four factors: the managers' profile; their perception of the environment; their firm's characteristics; and their information network. A cluster analysis reveals that the sampled firms can be grouped into four separate categories, according to the intensity of their technological scanning activities and the type of strategy used. In the first category, where scanning is most developed, the SMEs emphasize cost reduction and control, followed by improvements in competitiveness; they seek mainly financial and human resource information, and use their own internal resources to obtain it. A second category, where scanning is least developed, puts the emphasis on increasing production capacity and flexibility; these SMEs seek very diverse information from many sources. Of the two intermediate groups, one aims to diversify and increase the quality of products and services; marketing information is obtained through customers, suppliers and subcontractors. The other, whose scanning is better organized, favours increasing production capacity through innovation and market information with the help of governmental and financial institutions. This research concludes that there is no ‘one best way’ to environmental scanning in manufacturing SMEs, and that it all depends upon the organization, its objectives and its environmental pressures. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Purpose: Regardless of the noteworthy growth in research and practice associating corporate social responsibility (CSR) with human resource management, little has been written in regard to one major dimension of CSR in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as CSR policies and practices are directed toward employees. The purpose of this paper is to develop and test a conceptual framework connecting socially responsible human resource management (SRHRM) to competitive performance that fits small business. Design/methodology/approach: In order to get empirical evidence, structural equation modeling technique was applied on the data from 481 Spanish SMEs. Findings: Results confirm both the direct contribution of SRHRM to business competitiveness and the multiple effects resulting from including two variables of additional interest for the relationship under study: employee’s commitment and relational marketing. Practical implications: One of the main research limitations is that the paper only reflects the perceptions of owners/managers of SMEs. Although it was believed that the respondents give reliable and accurate information about the way their firms are involved in CSR practices, there is a possibility that they might provide incorrect or incomplete information. Originality/value: The relationships proposed have never been studied before in context of SMEs. This is a worthwhile endeavor, which makes an empirical contribution. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper's aim is to evaluate the effect of the use of information technology and communications (ITC) on the international competitiveness of firms in developing countries. The study also seeks to evaluate other factors that allow or condition the use of ITC such as: human resources, collaboration of the industrial sector, and local environment. Design/methodology/approach: These effects are examined through an empirical research of 100 small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from a developing country - Peru. Findings: SMEs from developing countries follow an isomorphic approach. This is because they tend to imitate or copy the better practices from developed countries. The results have shown that ITCs have a positive effect on the international competitiveness of firms. Research limitations/implications: A limitation is the cross-sectional character of this research. Practical implications: Firms use ITC to manage their inventory, for the communication between manufacturers and offices, and suppliers, for bill payments, and for the management of sales and marketing, and for the management of their networks. Originality/value: According to the literature reviewed, this study is one of the pioneers in contrasting empirically whether the use of ITC contributes positively to the international competitiveness of firms in the developing countries of Latin America. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are considered engines for economic growth, not only in India but all over the world. They account for 80% of global economic growth. Market conditions have dramatically changed for Indian SMEs after economic reforms. SMEs are regularly facing new challenges in terms of cost, quality, delivery, flexibility and human resource development for their survival and growth. In the context of a dynamic market scenario, they have to formulate their strategies for developing various capabilities and competencies to satisfy their domestic as well as global customers. For long-term competitiveness, SMEs have to focus on all aspects of organisational functions such as assets, strategy development, processes and their performance. This study tries to illustrate this concept with the help of a case study. It is observed that to be competitive, SMEs should have clarity of mission and should proactively develop their human resources and competencies to meet fast changing customer requirements.

abstract={Nowadays, the global economy requires developed countries to undergo industrial restructuring. In this context, industrial small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) need to collaborate with the service sector to enhance their competitiveness and strategic capabilities. Indeed, industrial service SMEs have been the object of particular attention from governments since these enterprises have become a key element for manufacturing and innovation networks in developed countries. However, these firms, as well as the manufacturing SMEs they serve, now face the challenge to internationalize. This paper addresses the of the strategic capabilities required by SMEs in general, and manufacturing and industrial service SMEs in particular, to internationalize, as well as the effect of these capabilities on their export performance. These strategic capabilities are presented in a research model, which relates human resources (HR), product development capabilities and market development capabilities to export performance. In testing this model with a sample of 347 Canadian and French SMEs, similarities and differences between the two types of SMEs are highlighted. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={The paper analysed factors that has the most impact in influencing the achievement of a sustainable process management model in the implementation of Industry 4.0 concepts within the Czech SME manufacturing sector. Several factors were identified and their interactions with digital technologies within the production environments was analysed. These factors, from an organisational perspective were identified as critical to success in the quest to achieve Industry 4.0 compliance and digital transformation of the manufacturing operations of companies. They include: strategy, organisational fit, competitiveness, operations and human resources. A mixed methods approach was adopted for the research. It involved both the qualitative and quantitative methodological approaches. The qualitative aspect involved an extensive systematic review of relevant literature which was useful in developing the conceptual framework and identifying the relevant factors that enable the implementation of an efficient Industry 4.0 process management model in SMEs; the quantitative aspect involved the use of a survey questionnaire to collect data which was analysed using confirmatory factor analysis statistical approach to test the measures of the constructs in the proposed conceptual framework. The result from the statistical analysis shows the factors that in the conceptual model that were supported as being relevant in achieving an efficient process management model for successful implementation of Industry 4.0 concepts in Czech manufacturing SMEs. The research limitation is based on the fact that the SMEs covered in the quantitative aspect of the research are restricted to a particular geographical location – Czech Republic. It would be interesting to have similar studies conducted in other geographies for a comparative perspective. It contributes to the scientific and practical discourse on Industry 4.0 process management model implementation in SMEs by investigating the phenomenon through the production of credible scientific evidence. © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse empirically the corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategic effects on the competitive performance of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by performing a multiple mediator analysis. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical research was conducted in Spanish SMEs. A questionnaire was distributed among managers of these companies. Thus, with a final sample of 481 cases and using consistent partial least squares structural equation modelling, direct and mediating effects were tested. In particular, relationships among corporate social performance (CSP) (exogenous variable), competitive performance (endogenous variable), relational marketing (mediating variable) and innovative capacity (mediating variable) were hypothesized. Moreover, a further analysis about the superior returns offered by socially responsible practices related to core business stakeholders was conducted. Findings - The results highlight a significant and positive effect that CSP has on competitive performance. Additionally, both mediating positive effects were supported and the firm size was checked as a relevant control variable which, as proxy for resources availability, affects all constructs used with the exception of relational marketing. Managers interested in a strategic approach to social responsibility should be aware that the investment in activities related to employees and customers leads to higher competitiveness. Research limitations/implications - The study was limited to SME in Spain. Moreover, information related to competitive performance was gathered from managers' own perceptions, considering the performance of their direct competitors as a reference level. Originality/value - To the authors knowledge, no research studies were found that empirically examined the business case in SMEs and employed a CSR approach based on stakeholders' perspective. Therefore, the main contribution of this research is to show how socially responsible management of SMEs leads to higher competitive performance both direct and indirectly, using two strategic variables suggested in literature on large corporations. Despite their resources limitations, this kind of organizations is in a favourable position to engage with different stakeholders and benefit from their relationships, especially with employees and customers. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This paper compares and contrasts the current attitudes towards, awareness of and take-up of eLearning in large and small organizations and outlines the implications for human resource development (HRD) professionals. An in-depth study was conducted in Ireland with a number of large multinational organizations and a number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the engineering, electronics, aerospace, pharmaceutical and medical device sectors. The study focused on awareness, perceptions, technology support infrastructure, current and planned involvement, most frequent and most preferred methods of delivery, benefits, barriers, the motivational factors and overall attitudes to eLearning. The comparison describes a number of similarities and a number of differences both within the large organization sector and within the SME sector and between the two sectors. Finally, the implications for HRD professionals are discussed. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of this study is to relate the practice of organisational learning in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to the organisational life cycle (OLC), contextualising the differential aspects of an integrated relationship between them. Design/methodology/approach – It is a mixed-method study with two consecutive phases. In Phase I, 30 Hong Kong SMEs identified through theoretical sampling were classified into three life-cycle stages – inception, high growth and maturity. In Phase II, their employees’ learning practices (grouped by learning levels) were statistically compared using the analysis of variance and then followed up for confirmation with qualitative semi-structured interviews. Findings – This study uniquely suggests the nature of a relationship between SME organisational learning and the OLC. Empirical results show that three of the four learning levels (individual, group, organisational and inter-organisational) practised in SMEs are varied in importance between life-cycle stages. Research limitations/implications – Comparative studies are encouraged in other parts of the world to strengthen the findings – with either SMEs or large organisations. Practical implications – The study informs SME owner/managers about what is important for employee learning at different business stages so that appropriate learning strategies or human resource development policies can be formulated in a timely fashion to promote competitiveness. Originality/value – It is among the first studies to connect SME learning with organisational growth.

abstract={Despite the heated debate on the Information Technology (IT) investment–performance paradox, the resource-based view (RBV) has received relatively little attention as an approach to explain such phenomena, particularly in the small and medium enterprise (SME) and e-commerce context. This study draws on the RBV perspective to empirically examine the association between SME e-commerce investments and firm performance. We collected firm-level data from 430 British SMEs across 16 industry sectors. Results demonstrate that RBV provides strong theoretical support, that is, business resources, human resources, and external resources (i.e. e-commerce readiness) strongly contribute to enhanced firm performance. The sophistication of SMEs' e-commerce websites contribute to firm performance, but those firms' capital investments in IT and e-commerce training per se are not significant performance drivers. Our findings suggest that UK SMEs can and do differentiate themselves on the basis of their e-commerce capability, which is created by the synergistic combination of e-commerce resources with other organisational resources and capabilities. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Thanks to their dominant role in fostering socioeconomic prosperity, exporting small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are perceived to be a major societal asset. Coming out of the great financial crisis, initiatives to nurture their (export) competitiveness have been high on the political agenda. In this vein, a growing literature explores the pertinence of firm-specific factors for explaining differences in SMEs’ export behavior. However, the puzzle of how intangible, knowledge-based assets, such as human and relational capital, contribute to establishing a viable position in export markets remains. By synthesizing empirical evidence from 167 studies, this meta-analytic path analysis reveals significant differential direct and indirect effects of human and relational capital endowment on dimensions of export behavior. Concurrently, our analysis uncovered that positive influences of intangible assets are context-dependent. In fact, human resources appear to be particularly pertinent for exporting SMEs in developing economies. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Purpose – Globalization of markets and increasing expectations of customers have created a turbulent environment for Indian organizations. The purpose of this paper is to study the development of various competencies by small-, medium- and large-scale Indian organizations under various pressures and constraints. Design/methodology/approach – For collecting data, a questionnaire-based survey were conducted. Out of 241 responding organizations, 193 were small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and 48 were larger organizations. Statistical analysis of data acquired from the survey are done by reliability test, t-test and correlation analysis. Findings – Introduction of new technology and identification of market changes have emerged as most important competencies because they are significantly correlated with subjective performance, objective performance and overall competitiveness of organization. Levels of focus given on competencies development by large organizations differ significantly from SMEs. Research limitations/implications – Findings of the study imply that SMEs should be as proactive as large organizations in making changes in terms of various processes such as development of competencies, human resources, upgrading of technology and awareness about market changes. For validating these results, further case studies are recommended. Originality/value – This study will help organizations in shaping their competitive strategies for developing competencies as per the market needs. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this conceptual paper is to name and categorize risks related to emerging technological innovations and to propose a number of countermeasures. The emphasis is placed on knowledge risks that are grouped under human, organizational and technological spheres and are presented from a small business perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The presented paper takes into account the prior literature and the authors’ thoughts and experiences to identify potential knowledge risks and countermeasures. Findings: Having a better overview of possible knowledge risks that may emerge in conjunction with the adoption and application of emerging technological innovations can help small businesses to better assess these new developments and their possible upsides and downsides. The proposed risks and countermeasures can also help policymakers as well as other organizations working for or together with smaller businesses to help them maintain and even increase their competitiveness. Practical implications: Different implications are suggested for not only managers and employees in small businesses but also other stakeholders working for or with small businesses. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first one that focuses on how small businesses can improve their decision-making regarding the adoption of new emerging technological innovation from a knowledge risk perspective. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Human resource management (HRM) is one of the elements enabling an organization to remain competitive in turbulence conditions. The effective practice of HRM makes competent and innovative employees contributing to the achievement of organizational objectives. This study aims to analyze HRM practices in creating innovation and organizational performance. The questionnaire was used to measure the respondents’ perceptions of variables used by a Likert scale. A survey of 126 manager samples and middle managers at export-oriented short and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Bali, Indonesia, was conducted to test the model. The analysis has shown that the proposed model was proven to be compliant with the research hypotheses. HRM significantly affects organizational performance and innovation, and it was found out that innovation can improve organizational performance. However, in the process of simultaneous testing, it was found out that innovation cannot improve organizational performance. The lack of attention to investments in human resources became one of the barriers to SMEs in creating innovation. © I Gede Riana, Gede Suparna, I Gusti Made Suwandana, Sebastian Kot, Ismi Rajiani, 2020},

abstract={To pursue the high environmental performance, economic and social effectiveness of the companies, including small and medium enterprises (SMEs), is the key goal of the sustainable development concept. Sustainable development is based on preventive management principles, and their application in SMEs has become an important issue for enhancing competitiveness. Unfortunately, most of the sustainable development-related research is focused on large companies rather than SMEs, especially in the industrial sector. The importance of SMEs often remains unnoticed. Besides, SMEs themselves often have inadequate knowledge about their environmental and social impacts and management, and apply voluntary preventive measures less frequently than large companies. To make sustainable decisions and to improve the environmental performance, economic and social effectiveness of SMEs, an integrated sustainable management system (SMS) based on financial analysis is necessary, oriented to strategic sustainability goals, not requiring significant financial and human resources. Integration of sustainability management accounting and composite sustainable development index methodologies forms the basis of SMS for SMEs decision making. SMS was applied in three pilot SMEs (small-scale wood parquet, medium-scale wood pallets, medium-scale beverage producing companies). In this article, an extensive analysis of a small-scale wood parquet manufacturing company's case is presented. The application of SMS enabled to identify key sustainability problems and to find solutions to improve the companies' sustainability performance. SMS application resulted in reduced input materials consumption and the reduction of sustainability costs. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The study aims at investigating the factors that affected the degree of adoption of new technologies in Nigerian SMEs. New technologies are by and large dominated by ICTs. Data for the analysis come from sixty-seven SMEs located in Aba, Ibadan, Lagos and Nnewi. One of the major factors inhibiting ICT diffusion and intensive utilisation is poor physical infrastructure represented by adequate and uninterrupted electricity supply and communication connectivity infrastructure. Findings of multivariate analysis suggest that firm-level variables such as financial capacity and technological absorptive capacity influenced the intensity of the adoption of ICTs. The results also suggest that globalisation of the Nigerian economy also influenced the adoption of new technologies.

abstract={Background and purpose: Recent reviews of the human resource management (HRM) literature continue to position knowledge management and intellectual capital as the key determinants for competitiveness, productiveness and organizational performance. This article explores the nexus between knowledge-based HRM practices, knowledge management capacity, intellectual capital, product and process innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Design/Methodology/Approach: Data were gleaned from 250 registered SMEs in Jordan using a simple random sampling technique. A covariance structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) was deployed in testing the proposed research model. Results: The findings cast light on the positive influence of knowledge-based HRM practice of SMEs on SMEs knowledge management capacity, intellectual capital and, product and process innovation. Similarly, knowledge management capacity SMEs exerts positive impact on their intellectual capital and, product and process innovation. Intellectual capital also emerges as a strong predictor for SMEs product and process innovation. Finally, a serial indirect effect (mediation) of knowledge management capacity and intellectual capital on the relationship between knowledge-based HRM practice of SMEs and, product and process innovation were revealed. Conclusion: Knowledge-based HRM practices and innovation have received vast amount of research attention, yet there is a lack of understanding on the process by which the former leads to the latter. Drawing on knowledge-based view (KBV) theory, this study is among the first attempts to unveil the structural process between knowledge-based HRM practices and innovation through knowledge management capacity and intellectual capital. This study theoretically validated the KBV framework in a non-Western context and demonstrate the importance of knowledge-based HRM practices for SMEs innovativeness. The findings do not only provide useful insights for managers and scholars, but also serve as the building block for future research. © 2019 Mohammad Jaber Yousef Al-Tal et al.},

abstract={In this paper, the following research problem was addressed: Is there a significant economic impact of multidimensional specified competitiveness within the EU (28) countries on the competitive business environment, human development, and sustainable growth? Based on the mentioned research problem, we formulated the aim of paper: To detect the significant interrelations among the assessment of global competitiveness, business environment as well as human development in the EU (28) countries for the period of 2006-2017. To address these problems, the methodology of global multi-criteria indices, namely the global competitiveness index (GCI), doing business index (DBI), and human development index (HDI), as well as panel analysis and non-linear regression analyses with ANOVA, were applied. The panel analysis results suggest that there is a direct linear relationship between the GCI and HDI. Moreover, the impact of the DBI on the change in the GCI score was not confirmed. We identified the main areas of countries' interest, and important economic and statistical significant relations of competitiveness by creating three models: The GD model (constructed by GCI and DBI scores), GH model (GCI and HDI scores), and GDH model (GCI, DBI and HDI scores). Based on the results, all interrelations were confirmed. However, the highest extent of variability for the explanation of the selected data was recorded in the case of the GDH model (87.12%).We detected the impact of the business environment and human resources as competitive advantages on global macroeconomic competitiveness. As the business sector in EU (28) countries is represented mainly by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), enterprise activities play a key role in the process of sustainable competitive economic development. Moreover, human resources are considered to be another important driver of the internationalization of European SMEs. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={This paper addresses the challenge of modelling individual cyber-physical systems (CPS) for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in manufacturing industries. CPS are key technology building blocks for the implementation of Industrie 4.0. Especially for SMEs the increase of production efficiency and reduction of manufacturing costs through CPS offer potential to maintain their competitiveness and innovation capacity. Although SMEs perceive the potential of CPS, they often lack financial and human resources to acquire the necessary CPS-competencies as well as an overview of all the currently available technological solutions. To overcome this issue a matching platform will offer SMEs support in finding suitable CPS-components by letting them express their functional and technical requirements. The matching logic is based on a set of morphologies that encompasses the functional and requirement spectrum of CPS-components. The matching algorithm analyses the input for congruence of requirements and available technologies and suggests suitable technology combinations. This paper describes the methodology of the matching platform, and introduces the research work to define and to develop the technology morphologies. The presented results facilitate the selection and configuration of CPS for SMEs. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In relation to the problem of SME productivity, it is necessary to investigate whether there is a problem of mismatch between workers and work and groups and corporate cultural values. This study aims to analyze whether the concept of innovative work behavior can mediate the relationship of person-job fit, person-organization fit and person-group fit to job performance. The study was conducted in the metal SME industry in Tegal Regency, with 256 respondents. Data collection tools use questionnaires and interviews. Data analysis is done with a structural equation model. Based on the results of the analysis, there is a positive relationship between variables. This illustrates that the challenges of SMEs in the future are to maintain the best human resources to remain committed to the organization. In maintaining its existence, alignment of individual values with work, organization and groups is the best tool to achieve goals through innovative changes in employee behavior, and also to lay a solid foundation in the recruitment and selection process of new employees that have the potential to increase job performance. © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are seen as one of the main drivers of economic growth in the modern economy that is characterised with free markets, private ownership, entrepreneurship, and a major change in the basic approach to business and management. As a result, human capital is regarded as the most important asset, and therefore, in order to grow and prosper, SMEs need to embrace the strategic approach to the human resource management (HRM) which should, in return, increase their competitiveness and responsiveness to the market changes. The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of strategic human resource (HR) practices on organisational performance. The results of hierarchical regression used to test the hypothesis supported the relationship between strategic HR practices and business performance. The findings presented in this study were used for making recommendations to the SMEs' managers in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Copyright © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The concept of clusters is based on creating entrepreneurship and competitiveness of interrelated organizations. The essence of the cluster initiative is to stimulate cooperation between individual enterprises and institutions, to accelerate innovation processes and thus to improve competitive position of enterprises operating within clusters. However, the participation in this initiative, based on the principle of cooperation, is also burdened with some negative effects resulting from the nature of cooperation and type of participants. The main aim of this paper is to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the participation in tourism clusters from the point of view of Slovak small and medium entrepreneurs. For evaluation, there were used the results of questionnaire surveys, which was interpreted by the Chi-Square test. The results showed that the most important advantages are from the areas of networking and common cooperation and propagation. The most important disadvantages were recognized mainly by micro and small entrepreneurs from the area of human resources. © 2017. ASERS Publishing. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Most business enterprises are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and many of them are without a human resource and recruitment department. Thus, one of the challenges that organizations currently face is to find a strategy to retain and attract talent. To overcome this difficulty, enterprises must invest in employer branding policies and be aware of the factors that differentiate them from others when attracting employees. This study aims to develop an employer branding model applicable to SMEs, to increase and enhance the attraction and retention of talents. An exploratory approach based on a quantitative perspective was adopted to develop an employer branding model applied to SMEs, with two major reference employer branding models and frameworks used as the main support. The model of employer branding was applied to SMEs regarding four dimensions, whereby essential questions are asked, namely (1) organizational culture (e.g., do employees have a job description aligned with the corporate culture?), (2) company strategy (e.g., what is the strategy if business volume decreases?), (3) company reputation (e.g., how do you perceive and treat negative feedback?), and (4) reward systems (e.g., do you feel that your employees are motivated intrinsically or extrinsically or both?), ordered by layers based on a logical sequence. The new proposed model is expected to serve as a useful strategic tool and as a basis for attracting, retaining and managing talent, specifically in the SMEs context. This new model provides a set of strategic and competitiveness benefits for SMEs, while contributing to making enterprises more profitable. The model also contributes to SMEs having a better image and reputation, enabling them to stand out from others in the war for talent. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={This article's objectives are to analyze the trends related to knowledge management process in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and to compare these findings with the conclusions of other research studies designed for SMEs and to examine the level of formality in knowledge management processes according to the size of enterprise. As well, to propose a model suited to the characteristics of the small business. The information is collected from 22 Basque Country SMEs grouped into industrial clusters, through a survey that is conducted to identify the use of practices related to knowledge management. Results show that informal practices figure prominently in the day to day of the SME and that the knowledge management process is not standardized but that is performed by the collaborative work between people, among others. Besides, the size of the SME acts as a factor in regard to the level of formality in knowledge management process. This study helps SME managers understand where the organizational knowledge is found within organizations and, consequently, to not neglect the importance of people in keeping competitiveness high. The article provides new information on how firms located in a particular region of Spain perform in relation to knowledge management, and it could be considered a sort of benchmarking practice on the behavior of SME in managing knowledge, which will be useful for the organization when taking management decisions. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={In this paper we address Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as a competitive factor in textile and fashion value chain. CSR assumes a large range of activities focused on one or multiple targets, from work conditions to social programs, or environmental impact. The influence of CSR strategies on market performance depend on how truthful consumers will understand and believe to be the values offered by companies. The qualitative research has considered seven case studies from Portuguese textiles and fashion companies. We have found that a major obstacle to SMEs was the cost of CSR programs and their internai and externai communication. As a rule, SMEs have small financial investment capabilities and their human resources tend to be scarce and not available to engage more responsibilities. Moreover, managers argue they compete in the market with companies that have low production as well as low social and environmental costs. If CSR strategies establish a set of clear and transparent practices, consumers will be able to compare across world suppliers, will result in additional costs and clients are not willing to pay for. The development of an accreditation system, able to clearly establish the reality of CSR practices within companies, is an important contribution to the implementation of CSR strategies into the textile and clothing sectors. The researchers have developed a system that can be managed step-by-step, and implemented progressively as companies receive and evaluate market feedback. The system introduces a clear communication about the company’s actions and commitment to CSR, resulting in an unique labei, capable of stating to whom it may concern, the company’ present situation and its development year after year. © 2017 Gh.

abstract={The usage of information technology (IT) is one of the major factors for ensuring the growth and competitiveness of enterprises, as well as it also benefits the effective knowledge management within the organisation. There are large-scale knowledge management systems (KMS) covering the full functionality for facilitating the effectiveness and productivity of employees. These systems are frequently integrated into other organisation's management systems. But the most of the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) cannot afford to use these KMS, and also the full functionality of these KMS is not necessary for them. Thus, the solution is to combine the parts of cloud based knowledge management systems with business process information systems that jointly propel the business core of the enterprise. This paper investigates the architecture of different cloud based solutions for knowledge management to define the possibilities of cross-system integrations. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={Objective: We aim to identify internationalization profiles of SMEs for the period immediately following the global economic crisis (years 2010-2013) and characterise them with reference to the firms' competitive potential during the crisis (year 2009), and their competitive position at the end of the analysed period. Research Design & Methods: The study is based on a complementary data set derived from secondary (AMADEUS database) and primary sources of information (com-puter assisted telephone interviews with top managers) for 553 micro, small and medium firms located in Poland. We conduct a cluster analysis to identify different internationalization profiles of SMEs for the years 2010-2013. Findings: In the year of the global economic crisis ambitious investors on average had at their disposal substantially better competitive potential than the remaining two groups. Ambitious exporters were better equipped than cautious internationalizers only in terms of human resources, intangible resources and quality control. Implications & Recommendations: Policy support should be particularly oriented towards supplying information about foreign markets and fostering firms in an optimal allocation of their resources. Contribution & Value Added: The study suggests that the strategy of diversifying international markets during the economic crisis and recovery can be a means of improving performance and reducing excessive dependence on fluctuations in key markets. © 2018, Cracow University of Economics.

abstract={The rapid development of technology and the consequent change in working practices require a dramatically different approach towards training and development in organisations than has traditionally been the case. A review of the literature reveals a negative attitude towards training and development in SMEs, with long-term strategy being substituted for short-term financial gain. Our results confirm this conjecture that the same holds true in Northern Ireland, which is witnessing rapid technological advancement. This article lays the foundations for a body of work which will provide greater insights into training and development needs in SMEs. © 2001, MCB UP Limited},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the firm-level drivers of competitiveness of the Czech small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) using the complex firm-level competitiveness index. The authors explored the relationship between firm competitiveness and firm characteristics such as size, age, industry affiliation and location. Design/methodology/approach: The complex competitiveness index as a proxy for firm competitiveness was calculated from the survey data. In total, 132 complete questionnaires filled in by representatives of randomly selected Czech SMEs were collected in 2018. Additional firm characteristics (size, age, industry affiliation and location) considered as determinants of competitiveness were obtained from the commercial database Albertina and from the Czech Statistical Office. The determinants of competitiveness were tested econometrically by estimation of multivariate regression models. Findings: The authors mainly found a significant relationship between the firm size and competitiveness of the Czech SMEs. The authors have also confirmed that the least competitive enterprises are those operating in the agricultural sector and that regional location plays an important role in the determination of firm competitiveness. Practical implications: The identification of competitiveness drivers can provide entrepreneurs, managers and policymakers with important implications. It seems beneficial for the Czech SMEs to expand the scope of operations to achieve a larger company size, for example, by focussing on investment activities, direct marketing, improving entrepreneurial skills or by applying an aggressive sales strategy, especially towards markets with lower competition. Politicians may respond to these efforts by setting the appropriate policies that promote SMEs’ competitiveness, for example, through the hard and soft public support for financial and human resources. Originality/value: Although many studies on competitiveness have been published, there is still a limited number of firm-level studies looking at competitiveness from multiple angles rather than from the study of profitability and productivity. In contrast, the study uses a complex firm-level competitiveness index based on ten competitiveness pillars (technology, human capital, products, domestic market, networks, international markets, online presence, marketing, decision making and strategy) to capture the contribution of different resources and capabilities to firm competitiveness. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have developed a marketing capability that differs from the conventional one. Most of the literature has neglected marketing innovation, because it is considered an accident or implicit in other types of activities, and only recently it has been associated with competitiveness. The aim of this research was to verify the relationship of marketing innovation with the integral performance of SMEs, and their possible implications. Through the structural equations modeling, the effects of this innovation on business performance were estimated. The findings revealed its significant influence to guide business performance, by implementing new concepts and means of promotion, new methods of commercialization, and modifications to its packaging, influencing mostly in the commercial part, but also affecting the administrative, financial and human resources scope. © 2020 Universidad ICESI.},

abstract={Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) play a vital role in driving job creation and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in all economies worldwide. Their increasing importance also means that they must be innovative enough to survive and be sustainable, improve their productivity and competitiveness. It is pertinent for European SMEs to know the contributing factors driving their innovations, which will enable them to channel their limited resources to ensure they achieve their innovation goals. This paper examined the various factors that stimulate innovations within SMEs. Using the ordinary least squares regression analysis and data from the European Innovation Survey, the authors analyzed 296 European SMEs between 2011 and 2018. The results show that intellectual assets, financial support, firm investment, and human resources all significantly contribute to firm’s sales output across Europe. Conversely, it was found that financial support and innovation linkages were not significant predictors of firms’ innovations. The results are important for SMEs managers who are aiming to be innovative and improve their productivity. The study can serve as a practical guide on how SMEs can ameliorate their innovation potentials and activities. © Michael Amponsah Odei, Petr Novak, 2020.},

abstract={This study aims to explore what factors are critically associated with job retention in Engineering and Information Technology small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in South Korea, and how employers think about staff retention policy in relation to business growth. This contrasts with previous studies that mainly focus on employee motivation, job retention, and turnover. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted face-to-face with founder Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). The results suggest that an important factor influencing job retention policies of these SMEs was to motivate employees to make greater voluntary effort, including through developing a collaborative organizational culture, rather than solely offering them additional financial rewards or using other Human Resource Management (HRM) practices to improve individual performances. Interviewees believed that job retention and business growth were closely related, and they discussed various ways of eliciting emotional commitment from employees. Unlike research on larger firms, these suggestions did not involve immediate financial rewards. How employers thought that the roles played by employees strongly influenced their firm's productivity and competitiveness. This study suggests SME employers adjust their retention policy specifically to improve their firm's survival and long-term growth. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are one of the principal driving forces in the development of an economy because of its significant contribution in terms of number of enterprises, employment, output and exports in most developing as well as developed countries. But SMEs, particularly in developing countries like India, face constraints in key areas such as technology, finance, marketing and human resources. Moreover these SMEs have been exposed to intense competition since early 1990s because of globalization. However, globalization, the process of continuing integration of the countries in the world has opened up new opportunities for SMEs of developing countries to cater to wider international market which brings out the need for these SMEs to develop competitiveness for their survival as well as growth. It is observed from literature that pursuing appropriate IM practice is one of the ways of acquiring competitiveness among others, by effectively managing and minimizing inventory investment. Inventory management can therefore be one of the crucial determinants of competitiveness as well as operational performance of SMEs in inventory intensive manufacturing industries. The key issue is whether Indian SMEs pursue better IM practices with an intension to reduce their inventory cost and enhance their competitiveness. If so, what are the IM practices pursued by these enterprises? What are the factors which influence the inventory cost and IM performance of enterprises? These questions have been addressed in this study with reference to machine tool SMEs located in the city of Bangalore, India.},

abstract={In the midst of global financial slump SMEs of developing & developed economies appear to be a center of gravity for researchers and management practitioners and advent of globalization exaggerate its role indeed. In this situation only hundred percent exploitation of financial, human and technological potential of SMEs make certain the competitiveness and growth possibilities. Relatively little research has been conducted on performance management system in Pakistani SMEs. This study is more focused headed for investigating the PMS implementation and post implementation effects in small firms. Performance Management (PM) is a process for establishing a shared understanding about what needs to be achieved. It is an approach to managing people that increases the level of personal performance and business success. Any organization with suitable performance management system increase employer conviction that it has the right people in the right place at the right time. Performance management must consist of two basic components one is talent exploitation and preservation and second is performance feedback mechanism. In an organizational perspective one thing is quiet evident that maturity of employer-employee relationship depends upon employee job satisfaction and performance and conceptually job satisfaction and performance is directly proportional to each other. The dominant findings indicate that, SMEs in Pakistan are generally less likely to adopt 'formal' PMS practices, including setting goals, monitoring performance and performance evaluation practices. Similarly, they have not formulated 'formal' HR policy and human resource departments usually pursue traditional means of basic HR functions such as employee recruitment, training and compensation. However, from statistical results of textile sector small and medium enterprises exposed that employees do not have a clear understanding of what performance management system aim to achieve similarly big number of employees consider that performance appraisal is not aligned with organizational goals it has no functionality in employee career planning or progression. © 2010, INSInet Publication.},

abstract={The development of a viable and vibrant Small- and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) sector has been widely recognised as vital for sustaining the process of economic transformation in East and Central Europe (ECE). Owing to the high rate of change in competitive dynamics within transformation economies, SMEs seek to develop new knowledge themselves or, more likely, transfer, adapt and implement new knowledge obtained from outside sources in order to increase their competitiveness. The effectiveness of identifying and transferring new knowledge and best practice depends to an extent on the level of absorptive capacity of the organisation, which, it can be argued, is strongly related to its inherent level of Human Resource Development (HRD). This paper reports the initial results of a research project which investigates the priorities for HRD in SMEs to enable managers to identify, transfer, assess and implement new knowledge gained through access to external sources. The study identifies significant differences between HRD priorities identified by management and the preferences of employees and potential employees in the form of undergraduate business students. The conclusions indicate that firms should consider the importance of both their own and employees' motivational factors in managing knowledge transfer mechanisms.

abstract={Innovation is widely recognized as a key factor in the competitiveness of nations and firms. Also, it has played a significant role in business ecosystem, and the achievement of science and technology have greatly spread to the development of both local and global firms. However, there are factors that discourage the applicable capabilities of such innovations on business processes. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the degrees of barriers which block the use of innovation in the case of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam namely human resources, access to finance, transparency, tax rates, trade regulations and customs. The secondary data used were gathered from Enterprise survey (ES) of 479 small and medium enterprises in five different regions (Red River Delta, North Central Coast, Central Coast Area, South East and Mekong River Delta), which are conducted by the World Bank Group from 2015 to 2017. The binary logistic regression and Logit Model were used to process variables and data analysis. The major findings revealed that barriers of accessing financial capacity, trading regulations and customs have positively affected on innovation of SMEs in Vietnam. Finally, it could be emphasized that HR training has the strongest impact on innovation changes of the enterprises by 55.7%. © 2019 AESS Publications. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Human resource management (HRM) in contemporary economics is linked to a company’s success measured through numerous organizational measures (profitability, productivity, rate of innovation, market share, environmental performances, etc.). The role of HRM in large enterprises is relatively known, especially when the competitiveness and sustainable development are in question. On the other hand, small entrepreneurial and medium sized (SME) companies have not been greatly studied in relation to the HRM in the past. Although there is a lack of literature and empirical research in this area, several studies in the past decade and recent years emphasized the importance of the HRM for the survival and success of the SMEs. The reason why more and more authors today are arguing about the success of the SMEs is the perceived advantages of SMEs in a turbulent and unpredictable business environment. SMEs are seen as the driving force for vulnerable economies, a source of innovation, employment, and flexibility. Bearing in mind SMEs and their advantages, the authors have focused their attention on the economies in the Central and Eastern Europe countries (Slovenia, Serbia, Hungary and Bulgaria) where the SMEs are recognized as potential possibilities for economic recovery and development. Since human capital is recognized as one of the most important factors of enterprise success, the aim of this work was to explore the role of HRM in SMEs in the economies of Serbia, Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovenia, to determine the type of linkage between HRM and the success of small and medium-sized companies that operate in the CEE region, in light of the Cranet 2008/2010 survey data. The objective in this chapter was the exploration of the existence of organizations’ business strategy and HR strategy in SMEs, as well as HR departments, and the role of HRM in the business of the SMEs. The special task in this research was the exploration of the HRM activities and trends (recruitment, selection, compensation, performance management, training and development, human resource information system, etc.) that are present in the SMEs in the CEE region. The ranking of the SMEs’ performances is also presented and the relations between the existence of HRM and the several performance measures in these companies. Descriptive statistical methods, t-test of independent samples and ANOVAs tests have been used during quantitative analysis to explore the presented relations. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={Small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) play an important role throughout all the European Union countries and contribute to economies by revenue generation and employment. International markets provide vital opportunities for small firms and are considered to be the priority of some entrepreneurs. These priorities arise due to higher performance, enhanced competitiveness and long-term sustainability of small firms. The smallness of SMEs is seen as disadvantage in internationalization processes, as the firms often lack capital resources and capabilities that restrict possibility to capture business opportunities in foreign markets. Hence SMEs, aiming to expand internationally, have to rely on human resources, in particular on competencies of entrepreneurs and managers. Developing and leveraging entrepreneurial and management competencies contribute to the successes of small firms. While the entrepreneurial role of managers is related to the observation of the environment, selection of promising opportunities and formulation of appropriate strategies, managerial role is related to acquisition of necessary resources and coordination of all organization's activities. Thus entrepreneurial and management competencies are seen as the abilities to function effectively in these roles. The paper aims to investigate perceived competencies of founders and managers by comparing internationalized and non-internationalized Lithuanian SMEs. The quantitative research is based on responses to a questionnaire embracing entrepreneurial and management competencies. The sample comprises SMEs representing production, trade and service sectors. The study let us reveal that entrepreneurial competencies such as ethical competence and abilities to recognize and exploit opportunities are perceived as the strongest. Meanwhile, ability to plan and organize work, ability to coordinate implementation of various tasks and supervise own and other work and ability to convince and motivate people are perceived as the most important by respondents representing internationalized SMEs. The data demonstrate stronger perceived managerial competencies of respondents from internationalized SMEs. The research data let us gain insights into competencies developed by founders and managers and elaborate proposals for decision makers and future investigations.},

abstract={Investment in the productive systems of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the manufacturing sector is usually quite limited. For this reason, normal practice is to apply minor developments internally or upgrade equipment as it becomes obsolete to increase their productive capacity and competitiveness at a lower cost. However, the work team, mostly made up of engineers, does not usually have experience in the use of design methodologies but also they are often familiar with the functioning of various design and quality-management tools. This paper presents a clear and simple design methodology that facilitates the development of adaptations to items of equipment that might be considered one-off products. It includes a selection of design tools that are, according to the literature on the subject, the most common and best-known among engineers, and which are also best-suited to the environment of an SME. The design methodology was validated experimentally with the upgrading of a gear-rolling tester installed on the premises of an SME in the sector. The recommended techniques and tools were satisfactory applied opening the possibilities for further application of the methodology in similar machine’s upgrades in the future. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={THe aim of this article is to analyze the satisfaction of the employees of the dressmaking-textile sector exporting SMEs of Barranquilla, Colombia. THe theoretical perspective was mainly oriented from the study made by Robbins and Judge (2009). In this sense, a research based on the quantitative paradigm was developed, with a non-experimental transectional design, for which a census formed by the 19 exporting SMEs of the sector was carried out. THe data was processed by the use of central tendency measures, evidencing that the indicators below the established average are the variety of work, the recognition of performance, safety, permanence, opportunities and relationship with the companions; on the contrary, the indicators referring to salary, structure and labor flexibility, reached the highest levels of satisfaction. It is concluded that the global effects in this sector require the definition of strategies made by Colombian companies, aimed at enhancing job satisfaction, considering human resource as the most important factor in competitiveness. © 2018, Universidad del Zulia.

abstract={Developing talented human resources through learning entails nurturing innovation and improving competitiveness; to achieve innovation, tech-based SMEs within or around Korean technoparks must undertake learning organisation activities (LOAs). Our results demonstrate that six dimensions of the LOA model have more validity or a better model fit than the previous seven dimensions of the LOA model. Furthermore, three important sub-variables of LOAs (i.e., creating continuous learning opportunities, establishing systems to capture and share learning and providing strategic leadership for learning) have a positive and significant effect on learning transfer. Finally, transferring LOAs was found to mediate the relationship between LOAs and innovativeness by creating continuous learning opportunities (and future directions) and by providing strategic leadership for learning. © 2016, © 2016 SAGE Publications.},

abstract={Knowledge is one of the enterprise's most important assets that influence its competitiveness. One way to capture an enterprise's knowledge and make it available to all its members is through the use of knowledge management practices. This paper discusses the importance of knowledge management (KM) in Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and presents a framework to deal with knowledge management in order to enhance their competitiveness. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are known for too much implicit knowledge, limited resources, insufficiently shared between managers and other employees. So, in the context of SMEs, KM can be used to capture knowledge and experience generated during their operations, activities, and processes. This research paper addresses a new way of thinking about the role of KM in SMEs through developing a framework that combines five phases of the KM lifecycle (capture, creation, codification, communication, and capitalization). This framework is called "A Five C's Knowledge Management Framework". The application of this framework will improve the success rate and competitiveness of SMEs.},

abstract={The implementation of digital transformation features is highly required to provide sustainable growth and a high level of competitiveness. One of the essential components of the ensuring of SMEs readiness for digital transformation is a digital maturity model that can assess the maturity level based on the features of SMEs in Kazakhstan. This study is focused on the development of digital maturity and readiness model for Kazakhstan SMEs by revision of currently existing digital maturity models, defining the significant features of SMEs in Kazakhstan and developing dimensions, sub-dimensions and levels of the model. The proposed model consists of 6 dimensions and 15 sub-dimensions that are sufficient to assess major dimensions involved in digital transformation. The six layers are used to define the level of digital readiness. The developed model was validated through a survey conducted among 12 managers of the company with approximately 150 employees. The model allowed identifying significant areas for improvement and provided the recommendations for movement to the next maturity level. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The 21st century is the century of change and maybe one of the most important changes in the organizations' life is the transition from focusing on the development of the tangible assets to the development of the intangible assets and the interest for attracting human resources capable to generate performance. The survival of many companies depends on their willingness and capacity to adapt to such changes. (Abdulaali, 2018) In this dynamic and complex economic system, the intangible assets of organizations become primary, being decisive for the organizations' performance. In the new economic competition, intangible assets provide a sustainable competitive advantage, intellectual capital and intangible assets representing the key factor in company profitability and success. In the knowledge based society, intellectual capital has more value for organizations than tangible assets and knowledge becomes a permanent source of competitiveness (Bhatti, Zaheer, 2014). It is considered by specialists a valuable and strategic resource, since the success of organizations depends on creating, discovering, storing, disseminating, measuring and developing knowledge. The main objective of the research presented in this paper is to offer an overview on the specific problems and needs of the entrepreneurs financed through the Romania Start-up Plus programme, part of Start-UP Hub: The Entrepreneurs Laboratory Cod SIMS: 105648. A primary target of this research is to examine the components of intellectual capital and the way in which the intellectual capital influences the small business performance. The majority of the researchers agree that intellectual capital is directly connected to the performance of the SMEs sector. The results of our analysis shows the fact that intangible assets influence business development in various ways, such as increasing competitive advantage, expanding employee competency and improving organizational performance. © 2021 Ramona Todericiu, published by Sciendo 2021.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to examine the influence of the emotional intelligence (EI) of the human resources (HR) decision-maker on firm performance in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the possible mediating role of the use of a system of HR practices in that relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The research involves a sample of 157 managers responsible for HR in SMEs. SMEs are examined because in these firms, decisions are not usually adopted on a collegiate basis. It makes these firms an ideal context for studying the relationship between HR decision-maker’s EI and firm performance. Findings: Results show that the HR decision-maker’s EI determines firm performance in terms of generation of valuable HR and financial outcomes. They also confirm the mediating role of the system of HR practices in that relationship. Research limitations/implications: This research suggests that an adequate understanding of the importance of EI can guide efforts to boost SMEs competitiveness. Thus, as SMEs are an important part of the business fabric in the majority of developed economies, the implications of this study are significant. Originality/value: Findings in this research suggest that the workplace is not managed exclusively on a cognitive basis since emotional competences may play an important role in the HR management and SMEs’ performance. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Human capital is considered to be leading to the growth of innovation and it plays an important role in economic development and firms’ competitiveness. For this reason, the perception of different human resource (HR) risks and establishing a suitable and effective HR risk management system is an up-to-date issue. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the most important sources of HR risks in the V4 countries and to find out the statistically significant differences in the perception of HR risk sources between the V4 countries. To collect the data in the years 2017 and 2018, an online questionnaire was used. To evaluate the intensity of the HR risk sources and to find out the differences between the V4 countries, the methods of Chi-square test and Z-score of P-value were used. The results showed that a high employee turnover rate, insufficient employee qualification, low work morale and discipline are perceived relatively most intensely in Hungary compared to other V4 countries, when “low work morale and discipline” is perceived most intensely out of all four HR risk sources studied. „Employee mistakes” are perceived statistically significantly more intensely in Poland compared to the Czech Republic and Slovakia. © 2020, Czestochowa University of Technology.

abstract={This chapter interrogates human resource competencies vis-à-vis innovation in tourism which is an under-researched topic in the tourism literature. Innovation is pertinent not only for competitiveness for tourism firms and destinations, but also for enhancing environmental protection and social benefits in view of sustainable tourism. Innovation is a knowledge-intensive activity which depends on the capabilities of entrepreneurs and employees to learn and implement knowledge to create new and improved ways of doing things. In order to innovate, a specific set of skills is needed which include management competencies with a particular emphasis on leadership, strategic orientation, professionalism and finance management. Data from a national study in South Africa which investigated human resource and skills development in tourism are analysed. The findings reveal critical skills gaps in relation to financial, management and soft skills required for innovation across tourism and hospitality occupational levels and sub-sectors. From a human resource development perspective, issues concerning upskilling and upward career mobility in tourism are also interrogated. This chapter argues for targeted human resource development to foster tourism innovation and support tourism SMEs by enhancing management competencies and offering mentorships. In particular, it is proposed that tourism policy has a role in drawing attention to the importance of improved soft skills development in tourism among tourism and hospitality stakeholders. The chapter contributes to literature and policy debates by offering an enhanced understanding of competencies and skills, as well as policy interventions, needed for tourism and service innovation more broadly in the light of sustainable human resource management. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Continuous innovation has become a key factor in the global competition in order to acquire the additional factors of production and the new value adding processes, which are essential to keep a sustainable economy. Innovation and technological development in manufacturing automation, whereas on the one hand require changing operational processes and organizational modalities of work, further changing staff requirements for employees and entrepreneurs, on the other hand can help to create next-generation of enterprises, able to develop competitive solutions and innovative products. At the same time with innovative manufacturing approaches and methods, can born new professions, new knowledge and skills that will be more and more required to employees, managers and trainers. In this context, it is central to have innovative learning curricula for use of state-of-the-art technologies and this aspect demands manufacturing SMEs highly qualified staff. To enhance the competitiveness and the growth of businesses it is required the upskilling and training of employees to enable effective implementation of the business processes. This poses a significant challenge to SMEs, which often lack the funds and human resources to invest in staff training and translates into a distinct need to provide comprehensive upskilling and training programs in the form of smart learning solutions designed to enable SME personnel to pursue their training goals in a flexible, customizable and easy-to-access way. The research described in this paper sheds light on the perceived upskilling requirements of SME workers and the broad scope of manufacturing systems training materials developed by the innovative methodology of AuToMa smart learning system. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={There is a reasonable level of acceptance amongst policy makers, academia and international development agencies of the criticality of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) as important agents of development particularly in employment and income generation and the provision of goods and services. Successive governments in Nigeria continue to promote policies and agendas targeted to raise the competitiveness of the sector as part of the diversification of the economy and promote foreign direct investment (FDI). These efforts are yet to manifest in any significant reduction in importation of basic goods as well as double-digit unemployment rate. Several studies have focused on aspects of SME's performance with a sparse attention to the criticality of the impacts of conflict in the performance of the organisations leading to a wide gap in knowledge as to whether a conflict situation actually occurs in the SMEs, and if they do, how do they manifest? What are the impacts on performance and how effective are the administrative tools for managing them? This study attempts to bridge this gap. We adopt a survey method using a sample of 224 employees across a spectrum of industries located in Lagos, Ogun and Kwara States of the Federation of the Republic of Nigeria. While the prevalence of conflict was established in the study amongst the employees, compensation, reward and performance rating issues are most frequent sources of the conflict with behavioural manifestation including productivity scale down, battering the reputation and image of the employers as well as discouraging potential applicants. The study also found that most of the administrative tools to manage conflict are not considered very effective while a variation in the gender awareness to conflict was observed at the level of statistical significance. The study recommends conflict minimization strategies through a proper goal definition, conflict management skill upgrades with training, open communication, fair reward and compensation system. The risk of of the error occurrence is examined from the accountants' perspective. For this purpose, a questionnaire survey was used for data collection focusing on areas that are considered to be the most important by the accountants and the areas which are the most problematic. © 2018 Journal of Competitiveness.},

abstract={Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) enjoy a prime position in any economy. Subsequent to globalization, competitiveness has been established as the predominant factor in the markets. This has taken away all protection henceforth enjoyed by SMEs. Due to acute competition, SMEs are now facing a host of problems, including HR issues. A number of studies have examined various issues pertaining to SMEs. However, HR issues are yet to get the due focus. Though many studies have examined HR issues in SMEs, there exists substantial gap in literature in this area. The present study attempts to address this gap in literature. The study conducted in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India, collected data from a sample of 400 SME employees. Through Factor Analysis, the study has identified four factors that the employees perceive as problems faced by them. It is expected that the present work will trigger more works in the HR issues of SMEs. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc. All right reserved.},

abstract={The socio-economic dimensions of disparities, the long duration of regional equalisation processes and its political sensitivity require regional policy to become one of the core policies of the government. The second pillar of its successfulness is active participation of regional and local self-governments. In this article, we recommend to realise a growth-equalising strategy for the Slovak conditions after the SR accession. The growth-equalising strategy of regional policy should in our conditions: • Support and keep in growth the regional centres (developed agglomerations) that are decisive carriers of national-economy growth and create not only development resources in the Slovak economy but also a pro-growth environment for the equalisation of regions lagging behind; this part of the overall strategy is called growth-equalising strategy focusing on regional centres of national-economy growth (developed regions). These urban agglomerations are concerned: Bratislava - Trnava, Trenčín, Žilina - Martin, Poprad, Košice - Prešov and Banská Bystrica - Zvolen and the region of the city of Nitra. • Remove negative consequences of production decrement and adaptation to the new market conditions in the regions lagging behind, together with the support of localisation, revitalisation of the regions with deformed demographic and professional structure (the threat of social and economic degradation and marginalisation). This part of the overall strategy is called growth-equalising strategy focusing on regional centres in regions lagging behind. Urban centres must be the carriers of development also in such regions. In NUTS II. Western Slovakia the development of agglomeration Nové Zámky - Komárno is concerned, in the region of Central Slovakia - the development of the towns of Lučenec - Rimavská Sobota and in the East Slovakia region the development of the agglomeration Humenné - Vranov. • Both parts of the overall strategy should be implemented with a non-scattered concentrating model. The practice of regional development proved sufficiently that dispersing of funds, "strewing" an area with investments is a short term solution failing to provide long term changes of regional structures. In order to pursue effective use of national resources and, in particular, resources from the EU structural funds, the assumption that in the first after-accession stage (approximately 10 - 12 years) these funds will be absorbed by those cities and agglo-meration that dispose of decisive localisation advantages even today, is realistic. Preferring the growth-equalising strategy in its proposed concentrating form in the first stage after EU accession does not mean that the smaller regions out of the reach of the agglomeration development effects shall be excluded from the support. In terms of competitiveness changes till the year 2010, human resources, foreign direct investments, innovations, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and infrastructure, are analysed. According to model calculations the consequences of individual policies shall result until 2010, depending on the selected scenario, in changes in the competitiveness of the regions and GDP per capita development following the individual NUTS II and Slovak regions. Slovakia would approach 72.7 per cent of the EU 25 average forecast for 2010 (currently it is around 53 per cent). With the exception of the region of Bratislava (164.7 per cent) and partly the region of Trnava (74.3 per cent), Slovak regions would achieve values under 75 per cent of EU 25 GDP per capita. The knowledge gained by developed and also cohesion countries, however, shows that mostly the developed scope of regional institutions (including on the one hand institutions necessary for the functioning of the support mechanism and on the other hand institutions supporting transfer of technology and innovation, improving qualification, etc.) can, in particular, affect significantly the sustainability and triggering of regionnal growth. Particularly, the necessity to develop capacities needed for EU membership rises in the pre-accession period. This has resulted from the evaluation of the current situation of the Slovak public administration and ensuring the equalisation of the difference between this situation and the situation required from all EU Member States - existing as well as the new ones. With respect to Slovakia's interest to achieve EU membership in the year 2004 the building of effective and capable capacities for membership is a strategic priority.},

abstract={Despite the value of QFD (Quality Function Deployment), it has been applied to individual industries, or only to large companies with sufficient QFD-related human resources and sufficient financial resources. Most SMEs, which account for 80% of the world economy, have not been able to benefit from QFD, the tool designed to revamp the growth, due to the lack of financial and human resources to implement QFD and Kano Model. This paper is brought to assess the effectiveness of Kano-QFD approach for technology-based SMEs through the transfer intention model. In order to verify the effectiveness of the above approach, 860 technology-based SMEs in their establishment 3-7 years are researched for the learning transfer intention after the completion of Kano QFD education and training program. The results of this study are that the perceived content validity has the direct effect on learning transfer intention simultaneously with the partial mediating effect through the self-efficacy factor. The learner readiness does not directly influence the learning transfer intention and the self-efficacy completely mediates the learner readiness and the transfer intention. This research contributes to providing critical implications for the educators and training planners in in private sector as well as policy makers of technology-based SMEs in the public sector. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Purpose: After analyzing in previous papers the potential of Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) as a sustainability tool in Mexico’s building sector and studying its implementation mainly from government housing programs and normative instruments (a top-down approach), this work seeks to complement a holistic approach about its implementation in an emerging country like Mexico. So, the main objective of this paper is to analyze the possibilities of EPDs implementation in Mexico’s housing sector from the business sector (a bottom-up approach), determining the possible challenges this approach would have. Methods: The experience, vision, and perspective about EPDs from the main potential users of this ecolabel in Mexico have been considered. For this, a questionnaire to housing developers and Mexican companies implementing EPDs has been applied. Similar studies from developed countries have been used as a reference to establish a possible path for the EPD development in a business sector of a country like Mexico. Based on this analysis, an outlook and challenges for a bottom-up EPD implementation in Mexico’s housing sector has been made. Results and discussion: Reduce the environmental impact and increase the commercial competitiveness are two of the main reasons for companies to implement sustainability strategies. Although EPDs serve these objectives, and there are Mexican standards, normative instruments, and housing design guides recommending the use of this ecolabel, there are few housing developers knowing EPDs, and there are also few Mexican companies implementing this ecolabel. Moreover, there is limited knowledge about EPDs in Mexico, both by final consumers and professional buyers. On the other hand, the European benchmark has served to detect common aspects about the EPD implementation, as well as to establish a possible development path that can be used to accelerate its implementation by Mexican companies. Conclusions: In Mexico, there is a solid legislative and regulatory framework that can be used as a starting point to promote the EPDs in housing sector. There is also a widespread interest from companies in using ecolabels as part of its sustainability strategies. However, there is still not enough supply–demand for this kind of information, nor the technical and personnel capacity supporting the EPD implementation. Consolidate the human resources formation in life cycle assessment (LCA), inform about the EPD’s usefulness, and facilitate the understanding of such information to consumers and professional buyers would be the main challenges to promote this ecolabel in Mexico. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The objective of this research is to analyze the organizational factors that influence the intrapreneurial behavior of workers, taking as a target population the workforce represented by a sample of 392 people. The small and medium enterprises of the Coquimbo Region in Chile are in a competitive scenario that motivates them to make decisions to improve innovation and productivity. A model is presented and the results are compared with those of structural equation methods based on covariances. It was determined that intrapreneurial behavior is generated through the management support, autonomy at work, rewards and uncertainty in the workplace, factors that explain 62% of the variance of organizational identification the worker has his company. This, in turn, explains by 51% the variance of intrapreneurial behavior. © 2018 Centro de Informacion Tecnologica. All rights reserved.},

El desarrollo económico de las naciones y por consiguiente el bienestar general de todos sus habitantes, depende fundamentalmente de las actividades desarrolladas por sus empresas, las cuales están sometidas a fuertes presiones tanto de los competidores locales como internacionales. Este estado de las cosas obliga a estas organizaciones a innovar en sus estrategias de gestión para alinearlas con estas nuevas exigencias, siendo una de sus alternativas capitalizar el compromiso, capacidad, ingenio y creatividad de su talento humano hacia el diseño de una nueva filosofía organizacional (Rubio, 2015).},

abstract={According to Nonaka, companies must innovate through knowledge. Nevertheless, knowledge acquisition, application and sharing often require a reorganization of the company as well as all the people who constitute it. There is some empiric proof that good employee relations in developments that give rise to high levels of job satisfaction positively influences organisational performance. Thus, it is of utmost importance to study the influence of knowledge management practices in employee relations and on the company work environment. At the same time, leadership also may play an important role by enabling knowledge transfer and assuring a good human resource quality, thus fostering competitiveness. This study tries to identify the influence of knowledge (acquisition and application) and its sharing in "human resource quality relations" in SMEs. Thus, applying a questionnaire to 187 companies considered "SMEs leaders" in Portugal, this study, through a structural equation model, shows that knowledge management has a positive effect on Employee Relations Quality and Leadership has a mediating and positive effect in this relation. This paper, through a significant sample of SMEs, allows has to study the impact of KM practices in the quality of employee relations. This paper further investigates the relation between knowledge sharing and the ability to create a high level of quality of human resources.},

abstract={To enhance the competitiveness and the turnover of businesses in the fast-paced world of today means adopting the emerging Automation & Robotics (A&R) equipment that, in turn, require the upskilling and training of employees to enable effective implementation of the business processes. This poses a significant challenge to manufacturing Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the funds and human resources to invest in staff training, and translates into a distinct need to provide comprehensive A&R upskilling and training programs in the form of smart learning solutions designed to enable SME personnel to pursue their training goals in a flexible, customizable and easy-to-access way. The paper sheds light on the perceived upskilling requirements of SME workers and the broad scope of A&R systems training materials developed by the innovative methodology of ARIALE smart learning system. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) create a dynamic and successful European economy. Existing skill deficiencies in sales, management and administrative staff are adversely affecting competitiveness in almost a third of those small firms surveyed (Bolden, 2001, 2007). Additionally, attending face-to-face and classroombased development courses is problematic for time-poor SME managers. Thanks to the development of new technologies online learning is becoming commonplace due to wireless and mobile devices, together with the Internet boom, are providing the infrastructure necessary to support the development of new learning forms. Collaborative learning, especially as represented by an action learning approach, would seem ideal for SME managers. But can collaborative learning be adopted as a blanket approach in the case of SME managers? Or should one first take into account the contextual influences on learning, networking and collaboration?

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to propose a model for increasing human capital competitiveness in the tourism sector in emerging economies. Using Indonesia as an example, the authors study the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact and the sector’s resilience. Design/methodology/approach: Data was collected using a survey of 199 tourism workers in Magelang city in Central Java Island. The data was analyzed using structural equation model with Smart PLS. Findings: The results confirm that social and human capital influence business success. Furthermore, innovation moderates the influence of human capital and social capital on business success. Originality/value: By conducting a primary survey with the tourism workers and those who work and interact with the tourism industry in Indonesia, the authors show how a promising approach to creating and sharing agile knowledge can enhance the tourism industry micro, small and medium enterprises in emerging economies during and post-COVID-19 pandemic and after. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This chapter examines the technology, human resource management, and service quality issues that inhibit and/or support managers and employees in adopting sustainable telework programs using data from two Australian case studies. The Telework Conceptual Framework developed in this chapter provides guidance for government policymakers and managers in organisations (SMEs, not-for-profit, and large organisations) on the choice of technology, human resource management considerations, and service quality issues relating to the sustainable adoption of telework. A business case for telework should include the components of technology, human resource management, and service quality (customer service) that will contribute to an organisation's profitability. The contribution of telework to an organisation's competitiveness is an important prerequisite for management to embrace telework and other flexible work practices. © 2015, IGI Global.

abstract={Building-up the knowledge society through human capital and innovation activities, particularly generated through SMEs are generally the driving force of economic development, are developing options for future competitiveness in the form of new knowledge, and are increasing the efficiency of the economy and its ability to act. Since countries like Finland, Germany, Denmark and Sweden reach highest innovation performance among all EU countries, there are countries like Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, Poland or Slovakia which drag behind other European countries and rank among the countries with the weakest innovative performance. The aim of this paper is to identify the enablers of innovation in European SMEs by using the concept of intellectual capital. Through statistical analysis we have investigated how knowledge networks, which can be considered as the source of knowledge initiatives in SMEs, contribute to their innovation activities. According to conclusions of our analysis, creating knowledge network, which secure knowledge circulation and spilling over partners consisting of universities, state or local governments and SMEs, will increase knowledge base of the economy of a country, i.e. will grow the innovation activity of enterprises, improve the quality of human resources, research and technology, which are considered as key factors of European competitiveness.},

abstract={We examine the importance and the role that digital marketplaces play for SMEs in developing countries. By building on the literature of digital marketplace and business models we argue that the features of the context shape the type of the business models applicable for digital marketplaces. We suggest that before designing a digital marketplace initiative it is necessary to undertake a context assessment that ensures a better understanding of the firms' preparedness to the usage of this kind of platforms in terms of technological infrastructure, human resources' capabilities and skills, integration and innovation level among firms. It is essential to start with feasible initiatives and build up steadily the qualifications necessary for facing hindrances. However, starting at the right point and in the right way doesn't automatically guarantee success and competitive advantage of SMEs, but can represent a way to start admitting the fundamental role of the innovation in a high complex environment. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In the networked economy firms are recognizing the power of the Internet as a platform for creating different forms of relationships and collaborations aimed to enhance value and achieve a sustainable competitive advantage. Digital Marketplaces represent one of the most powerful solutions adopted by firms to support the networking practices among firms, especially among SMEs. However in developing countries the potentialities of digital marketplaces remains largely unexploited. Different human, organizational and technological factors, issues and problems pertain in these countries, requiring focused studies and appropriate approaches. This article argues that in order for firms in developing countries to benefit from digital marketplace platforms it is necessary to root them in an assessment study which permits to understand the firms preparedness to use the digital marketplace in terms of technological infrastructure, human resources' capabilities and skills, integration and innovation level among firms. Based on the outcomes of this assessment it is then possible to find out a viable digital marketplace model that fits with actual readiness status of firms and helps them to develop progressively the necessary resources and capabilities to enhance their competitiveness in the current digital economic landscape.},

abstract={Today in order to stay in businesses and prosper, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are seeking higher electiveness and competitiveness across the entire cycle of marketing, product design, manufacture, test and sales. SMEs play an increasingly important role in all aspects of competitiveness: both products and production techniques, but also management methods, the organization of the firm and human resources training. One of the ways by which SMEs can achieve a competitive advantage in manufacturing is through the implementation of Advanced Manufacturing Technology (AMT). An increasing number of them have chosen and are choosing various levels of AMT as the solution. Realizing the importance of SMEs, an attempt has been made in this paper to review the application of AMT in SMEs. Also, a framework has been offered for the implementation of AMT in SMEs. Finally, a summary of findings and conclusions are presented.},

abstract={Purpose: Routine dynamics provide a robust theoretical framework to explore a wide range of organizational phenomena. However, the study of routines and the effect of technology on its performativity in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) still lack attention by researchers. This paper aims to analyze how the balance between process technology and human cognition affects routines' performativity in SMEs. Design/methodology/approach: It was conducted a multicase study composed of Brazilian SMEs in the bakery industry. Data collection took place through interviews with managers and employees, observation of operational processes and document analysis. Thematic content analysis was adopted for categorization and data analysis. Findings: The authors’ findings allow inferring there is no primacy of a more automated or artisanal production process to achieve competitiveness, which breaks the paradigm of the superior performance of automated production over the artisanal process that haunts SMEs. Though technology increases production efficiency, the artisanal approach can be valuable at promoting a company by commercially using this know-how to explore other business models appreciated by the public. Practical implications: The authors’ proposals became relevant in a practical perspective once it works as a parameter for SME managers' decision-making about new investments in production resources and to foster public policies and other actions developed by support services for small businesses. Originality/value: This study expands the frontiers in routines literature on SMEs, which lacks deepening. From this, SME managers can intensify actions to optimize process routines performativity through technologies or human cognition to keep the routines on track. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The importance of business models for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in terms of their competitiveness and sustainability is undoubtedly growing. The global Covid-19 pandemic even strengthens this trend. The degree of digitalization of corporate processes becomes the SME stability and development limitation. The paper submitted presents the results of research focused on the issue of digital transformation of business models on a test sample of 496 SMEs (out of which 214 operate in the manufacturing sector and industry and 218 are included in the services sector) using the method of dimensionality reduction and logit regression. The main output from the solution valid for both tested sectors is considered insufficient setting, management and evaluation of corporate processes. This applies to the main value-creating processes (input and output logistics, production, marketing and sales, service and other ancillary services) and supporting processes (purchase, scientific and technological development, human resources management and company infrastructure). In terms of the achieved degree of process digitization, an imbalance was found between the main value-creating processes and supporting processes. Investment in value-creating and supporting corporate processes are not considered an important factor for any of the sectors due to the high sensitivity of investments to the size and specialization of companies. In contrast, the higher perceived need for value chain digitization in both tested sectors, especially in the case of manufacturing and industry, is considered a very positive output. This proves the need for the digital transformation of companies and its positive impact on their profitability and competitiveness. © 2022, Centre of Sociological Research. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Innovation is the pillar of competitiveness of small and medium-sized exporting companies. This research aims to examine the incidence of technology, human resources and management with innovation in these exporting companies. The research approach is quantitative, the method is deductive, the type of research is correlational, with a non-experimental and cross-sectional design, using a sample of 126 exporting companies from the province of Guayas-Ecuador. The data processing was through factorial analysis and subsequently a linear regression was performed. The results show that technology and management have a positive impact on the innovation of small and medium-sized exporting companies, where management is mainly oriented towards resources, skills and knowledge to achieve innovation. The research provides the literature with empirical evidence of these relationships since previous studies have focused on the export success of this type of company or on examining their innovation without focusing on the exporters. It is concluded that it is important for the administrators of these exporting companies, because through increasing technology and management in these companies, their innovative potential is increased © 2022.

abstract={Innovation is needed by micro, small, and medium enterprises (SMEs) to grow and survive in an increasingly competitive business competition. However, innovation must be adapted to the existing constraints considering the limited number of employees, total assets, total revenue, and the amount of the budget for innovation. Forms of innovation that can be carried out by a business in an effort to increase its competitiveness include business model innovation, marketing, organization, processes and technology, products, services, and supply chains. Human resources is an important factor in improving the performance and innovation of micro, small, and medium enterprises. This study aimed to design an innovation strategy in accordance with the constraints, human resource capabilities and innovation opportunities in an effort to increase competitiveness. The analysis was done by using the structural equation modelling method with partial least square approach. It was proven that human resources play an important role because they greatly affect the success of both overcoming obstacles and the implementation of innovation. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

abstract={The aim of this paper was to obtain data and information on the digital transformation of human resource (HR) processes in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with the help of robotic process automation (RPA), in order to increase competitiveness in the digital age. Romanian businesses are attempting to close the gap with companies in developed countries by implementing projects that allow the adoption of emerging technologies in HR departments. This paper presents some of the preliminary findings, resulted from a collaboration between a university and an SME, for the efficient implementation of specific HR processes using RPA. The paper provides a brief introduction of the RPA concept as well as a list of HR processes that can be automated within enterprises, with the benefits brought to the enterprise and employees presented in both qualitative and quantitative terms for each HR process. In addition, a case study for the automatic collection of candidates' documents and extraction of primary information about them was considered. Further on, the problems encountered during implementation were listed, along with potential solutions. Given the benefits offered, RPA could play an important role in transitioning HR functions into the digital era. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Sustainable manufacturing is a critical phenomenon in the process of creating sustainable value. This is a way to increase innovation and resource quality. On the other hand, the partnership strategy is an important factor in efforts to improve company performance. The involvement of the partnership strategy is one of the factors that strengthen the achievement of sustainable values. Furthermore, this affects the sustainability of a manufacturing company’s competitiveness, including Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). In this study, we focus on creating sustainable value and the role of partnership strategies in improving the business performance of SMEs engaged in the metal manufacturing industry. The Partial Least Squares (PLS) approach to Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is used to evaluate relationships and effects based on survey data from small and medium industries. The results show that the creation of sustainable value, including products, processes, production, equipment, organization, and human values, has a significant impact (β=0.522; ρ<0.001) on increasing the competitiveness of small and medium enterprises. The effect of sustainable value creation on sustainable competitiveness is fully moderated by the partnership strategy (β=0.179; ρ=0.03), especially in the technology & equipment, and human resources. Apart from being a moderating variable, the partnership strategy has also been shown to significantly act as a partial mediating variable (β=0.135; ρ<0.05) for sustainable value creation in enhancing competitiveness. The partnership strategy‘s simultaneous involvement proves that the partnership strategy plays an important role in value creation to increase the competitiveness of sustainable manufacturing SMEs.

abstract={XYZ Souvenir is one of the UKM engaged in the creative and Madura souvenir craft made of flannelette. The problem faced today is how to maintain the sustainability of SMEs if they have different backgrounds and knowledge that make them have to share knowledge to maintain the sustainability of SMEs. Product innovation, optimization of raw materials, customer needs, target markets, marketing methods, are examples of knowledge that are not all known by each of the internal actors of SMEs. By implementing a knowledge management framework based on four KM conceptual models by Stankosky and mapping the Cimosa business process, which is intended to explore the tacit and explicit knowledge of internal actors related to the sustainability of SMEs. Qualitative methods are used in this study and the data collection model is in the form of interviews. With the implementation of the framework, there are nine critical success factors identified in the craft industry, especially those operating in the Madura region. Determinants of success are Price, Promotion, Packaging, Product Innovation, Online Stores, Product Quality, Finance, Human Resources, Collaborative Sources. In a four-action framework analysis, there are no success determinants that are eliminated because no success determinants are eliminated at an early stage so there is no reduction in the development of SME business processes in the reduction phase. The critical success factor development is carried out on the nine main criteria in the craft industry and creates two additional critical success factors, namely unique and trademark. In mapping, Cimosa's business processes, the process management phase consists of improving vision and mission, improving objective strategies, improving SOPs, and improving, evaluating, and monitoring processes. Support processes include human resources and IT process, production, and financial process, while the Core Process includes research and development, marketing process, and logistic process. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This chapter analyzes the practices of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability in Chilean small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This work follows an explorative and descriptive methodology that uses analysis of secondary information as data collection instrument. Results suggest that SMEs in Chile seem to have a higher degree of adoption of CSR practices when compared to those of other countries in Latin America. Chilean SMEs tend to concentrate their efforts in the area of human resources; therefore, these organizations are more willing to invest in labor-related issues than in the negative impacts they may generate in the environment and society. This can be evaluated as a natural first stage, since worker-focused CSR programs generally have a faster return on investment than those focused on other areas. Also, the relations that SMEs develop with local communities to create value are still an area of opportunity that can be addressed through the SMEs and CSR technical groups of the Pacific Alliance. This alliance is an ideal platform to share best CSR practices among SMEs, which probably will increase their competitiveness. © 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Small and medium-sized enterprises are affected by changing development, production and selling paradigms in globalized industries, where innovation is a driver for sustainable competitiveness. However, innovating is highly challenging for small and medium-sized enterprises, as human resources are very limited and know-how are often highly specialized. It is often unclear which fields and factors provide the capability to innovate and which measures or methods can be applied to promote innovation based on existing competencies. For this reason, the aim of this paper is to present a framework to support the innovation capability of SMEs by identifying promising fields for innovation and providing suitable innovation methods. A particular focus in this paper is a methodology for the description and identification of fields to foster the innovation capability in SMEs as a part of the introduced framework. © 2019 Design Society.

abstract={Purpose-This study aims to present an overview of SMEs’ innovation in China, to identify the main problems, and provide practical suggestions. Design/methodology/approach-The research of this paper is based on the collection and evaluation of existing literature and survey reports. Findings-This study presents the general situation and characteristics of SMEs’ innovation in China, and concludes the main reason that hinders Chinese SMEs’ innovation is the lack of human resources, capital, innovation culture and information. Practical implications-This study suggests that, in addition to improving resources and environment, SMEs can also try to adopt micro-innovation to promote innovation activities. These suggestions are practical and can help SMEs maintain competitiveness. Originality/ value-This study provides an overview of Chinese SMEs’ innovation, which can be the basis for future research in this area. © 2019, Universidad del Zulia. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This article evaluates the factors affecting the use of management accounting in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Hanoi, Vietnam. The factors include: Production and business characteristics; Competitiveness; Business strategy; CEO of awareness management; Human resource quality. The study is conducted on 238 SMEs in Hanoi and the results show that CEO’s awareness of management accounting had the strongest impact on the ability to apply management accounting of enterprises while competition level factor had the weakest effect. At the same time, the study also examines the significant role of mediating factor of firm size on the relationship between the characteristics of the production and business process and the application of management accounting, age and professional qualifications. The results indicate that enterprise size plays a significant role on regulating the impact of business characteristics of enterprises on management accounting application. For smaller enterprises, management accounting is less used and vice versa. Next, the younger the managers are, the higher the impact of their awareness on management accounting application, which means management accounting will be used more if managers are younger. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.},

abstract={The globalization and internationalization phenomenon stimulates not only the interlinking of economies but also interlinking and creation of intense relations among companies. A business of network nature contributes to the competitiveness on the global market. One of the form of network cooperation that is currently beginning supported more extensively in the Slovak economy is the cluster cooperation. Small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) by entering into these alliances have become a stronger partner and obtain position and influence against the large, and multinational companies that operate in the market. This form of doing business is influenced by a variety of risk factors that may threaten their activities and results in several areas. One of them is the area of human resources. In this context, the main aim of the paper is focused on the evaluation of risks that could have impact on SMEs' decisions for the entering in this form of cooperation from the point of human resources view. To achieve this aim, the results of questionnaire surveys realized among 988 Slovak SMEs were used. The empirical survey was set up for SMEs in the areas in which Slovak clusters operate. The results of this study is the evaluation of the perception of risks that arising from cluster cooperation and connected with human resources. This research contributes to the extension of cluster cooperation platform in Slovakia and gives some proposal for small and medium entrepreneurs to join the cluster cooperation.

abstract={The Portuguese business structure is essentially composed of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which, despite their size, generate employment and contribute to the increase of national income. In many of these companies, some of them having less than ten employees, management and operational functions are often carried out by the entrepreneur. In addition, the entrepreneur does not always have technical knowledge in management, nor do they have the available time (since they have various responsibilities within the company) to develop and implement a management strategy that allows the enterprise to remain in the market while adopting a more conscious, consistent and sustained orientation. Within the scope of the Operational Program for Competitiveness and Internationalization - Portugal 2020, the Balanced ScoreCard (BSC) strategic management instrument was developed and implemented in several companies and sectors of the Portuguese economy. This instrument was crucial in initiating a process of strategic thinking which, quite possibly, would not have happened in such a short time horizon. This research work analyses through an essentially qualitative research the way the BSC instrument was developed and implemented. Another objective is to understand the main advantages of its use and its main application constraints. The data was gathered through a semi-structured interview developed for the owners of four Portuguese SMEs in the northern region Portugal, targeted under the abovementioned programme framework. The results demonstrate the instrument was essential for the development of a structured strategic thinking, as well as for a better performance and, consequently, to the improvement of the competitiveness of the targeted companies. The results also show the instrument had to be adapted and simplified and its implementation has to involve all the employees of the enterprises. © 2018 Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE.

In the other hand, the introduction of new ICT (Information and communication technologies) technologies, such PLM, is a complex process that involves challenging the existing organization, not only in terms of information flow but also the human resources management and OEM/Suppliers relationship level. As seen in literature review, there are a number of factors that facilitate the adoption of ICT technology, but we also identified a number of obstacles that will need to act as the adoption takes place. The paper focused on issues regarding the ICT adoption, especially PLM solutions by SMEs.

abstract={Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face challenges consisting in limited financial and human resources dedicated to research and development processes, while being under great pressures to increase market competitiveness. Open innovation may support the efforts deployed by SMEs to enhance their creativity, the generation of new ideas and the development of new solutions to meet the increased expectations of customers. The goal of this paper is to explore the emerging trends in the field of online platforms that provide SMEs with the opportunity to access open innovation. The utility of this exploratory approach is based on the fact that SMEs represent an important share of the number of enterprises in the Member States of the European Union. At the same time, even if numerous open innovation platforms exist worldwide, few are actually online platforms designed for SMEs as solution seekers. The paper focuses on the online platforms that were set up in the European Union for the inbound open innovation processes of the SMEs. The main contribution of the paper to the studied field consists in tracking the present signs that may indicate potential future directions of evolution, as well as in underlining the specific implications for researchers and practitioners. © 2017, SRAC - Societatea Romana Pentru Asigurarea Calitatii.

funding_text 1={Use of data mining techniques in databases which comprise articles and scientific papers published by recognized experts in the specific field of interest for the solution seeker This trend consisting in the development of major types of online platforms is visible in relation not only to SMEs, but also to large companies that are involved in open innovation. However, the number of online open innovation platforms dedicated to SMEs is rather few. b) Setting-up of new online open innovation platforms for SMEs, by consortia with the financial support of the EU During the present decade, several projects based on EU funding were developed to stimulate the open innovation among SMEs. Examples of such projects are the following: • OpenAlps. This project was accomplished within the framework of the EU’s Alpine Space Programme. The interregional cooperation area targeted by this programme includes Austria, Liechtenstein, Slovenia and Switzerland, as well as parts of Germany, Italy and France. The goal of the Open Alps project was to provide the SMEs with the necessary support for implementing open innovation. The three-year project started in July 2011, with a total budget of 2.9 million Euro (OpenAlps, 2012a) from the funding ensured by the European Regional Development Fund and the participating countries. One of the work-packages of the project consisted in the development of a Web-based multilingual platform for open innovation. This platform is of the online marketplace type. The project partners were: the Chamber of Industry and Commerce Black Forest - Baar – Heuberg – the lead partner (Germany); Department of Management and Production Engineering of the Politecnico di Torino (Italy); CSP - research body in the field of Information and Communications Technology (Italy); Fondazione Lombardia per l’Ambiente (Italy); Verona Innovazione – Special Agency of the Chamber of Commerce of Verona (Italy); MFG Baden-Württemberg - Public Innovation Agency for ICT and Media (Germany); ARDI Rhône-Alpes (France); MRA Development Agency (Slovenia); Innovation & Technology Transfer Salzburg (Austria); Association ManuFuture (Switzerland) (OpenAlps, 2012b). • OPENiSME. The goal of the project is to improve the competitiveness of the SMEs by connecting them with researchers from public and private laboratories. The three-year project benefits from the co-funding of the European Union within the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme 2007-2013. The total budget of the project is 3.8 million Euro, out of which 1.8 million Euro from the EU (OPENiSME, 2015). The project partners originate in seven countries and they are the following: University College London – the project coordinator (UK); Laval Mayenne Technopole (France); Idexlab sas (France); Institut Josef Stefan (Slovenia); t²i – trasferimento tecnologico e innovazione s.c.a r.l. (Italy); Virce – Kompetenzzentrum Virtuellerealitat und Kooperatives Engineering w.V. (Germany); Vision 2020 Network (UK); Academy of Entrepreneurship Astikietaira (Greece) and TAGES (Turkey) (OPENiSME, 2017a). The project activities included the development of a platform able to connect SMEs with experts/researchers. The platform allows the identification and ranking of experts based on their “web footprints”. Through this platform, the SMEs that search for an innovative solution may accesses databases with more than 100 million published papers, patent databases and social media (OPENiSME, 2017b). The platform is of the solution search type based on best relevant expertise. This platform stands out from the range of open innovation projects through the use of big data and data mining techniques. • NIR-VANA. The three-year project started in 2016. It is based on the funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. The project includes an online collaboration platform and specific ICT tools (Nir-vana, 2017a). The consortium is made of the following organizations: Jena University (Germany); Blue Room Innovation (Spain); Fraunhofer Moez (Germany); Impulse.Brussels (Belgium); Swerea IVF (Sweden); Veneto Innovazione spa (Italy); Istanbul Chemicals and Chemical Products Exporter’s Association (Turkey); Innova Institute (Spain) (Nir-vana, 2017b). This project includes an open innovation platform that entered the pilot phase in 2017 (Nir-vana, 2017c). However, on the website of the project, the consortium refers to a “software platform” and does not provide enough information about the functionalities of this platform.

abstract={This book focuses on the relationship between business strategy and competition among Italian SMEs in the aftermath of the economic crisis. First examining business strategy and competitive advantage in a broader sense, Business Strategies and Competitiveness in Times of Crisis goes on to analyse the strategic behaviour of SMEs and the key factors that allow them to overcome the challenges they face. The book covers wide-ranging topics such as marketing and communication strategies, internationalization process and entry modes, access to credit, networking, innovation process and human resources enhancement. Referring to insightful case studies and surveys conducted between 2011 and 2014, it reflects on managerial implications for Italian SMEs and identifies their three main competitive challenges. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={The founding of the AEC (Association of Southeast Asian Nations Economic Community) in late 2015 is contributing to further opportunities in the international market for ASEAN (Association of South Eastern Asian Nations) countries. However, this is also leading to greater competition through an increase in the number of businesses. In Thailand, part of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) are significantly important to economic growth, employment rate, GDP and therefore their success has a critical impact on society. In this period of transition, Thai SMEs need the right supporting tools for their organisation to survive and grow. Globally, the adoption of Knowledge Management is becoming widespread with the potential to improve productivity and efficiency of various organisations. Successful Knowledge Management will benefit organisations through improving decision-making, quality of products/services whilst reducing the process lead-time and operational costs thus, contributing to market competitiveness. Despite, the large number of studies on Knowledge Management only few studies focus on SMEs. Furthermore, a systematic literature review conducted as part of this study highlights that whilst Knowledge Management research has been carried out in Thailand much of it is not accessible to non-Thai due to language. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify the current practice of Knowledge Management in Thai SMEs within the manufacturing sector and to examine how employees in the organization capture, share and store their knowledge as well as their perceptions about Knowledge Management. Survey questionnaires were distributed to SMEs in Manufacturing Sector in Thailand via online survey software (Qualtrics) and paper based version depending on participants' preference. The total respondents are 311 within 20 manufacturing SMEs across several business sectors. The paper focuses on two research questions which highlight the key differences that exist in knowledge management practices and perceptions in different sized SME's and between management and operational staffroles. In general, the results show the majority of employees in SMEs in Thailand consider Knowledge Management to be a beneficial tool with the potential to solve problems at work. However, it appears that the biggest barrier to knowledge capture is a lack of clear guidelines. Furthermore, the biggest barrier to sharing and storing knowledge is lack of time. This paper reports on the results obtained within Thailand. These results are part of a wider study which is currently drawing comparisons between Thailand and The United Kingdom.},

abstract={Knowledge and innovation are the key factors for sustainable business development. Therefore, new models of cooperation have to be launched that intensify the knowledge flow between business and academia. The Innovation Incubator at Leuphana University of Lüneburg in Germany is an excellent example for such a strategic partnership between university and regional economy. This approach of knowledge transfer is funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and focusses on strengthening the competitiveness of regional SMEs. As part of the Innovation Incubator the network for innovation and transfer "Performance Management in Medium-Sized Businesses" represents a concrete example of effective long-term cooperation between academia and business. This alliance aims at the constructive exchange of experience and knowledge between regional SMEs and academic experts in human resources and business development. One of the central questions for regional SMEs within this network is how to attract and recruit highly qualified employees. Within research-based working groups academic experts closely cooperate with business representatives in order to increase the employer attractiveness of SMEs. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

abstract={The enormous business competitiveness at a global scale and the constant search for sources of competitive advantage have led several scholars and practitioners to implement their studies to pay attention to the potential of HRM in the success of companies. Portugal, like others European countries, is not set apart from the question of HRM. However, it is rare and recent to find empirical literature on practice of HRM in Portugal, and even more scarce to find literature that focuses on SMEs. This study clarifies the situation of SMEs in the Portuguese context, serving as a basis for discussion on HRM in SMEs in an international context. This chapter looks to understand the role of recruitment and selection on Human Resource Management (HRM) at Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Portugal, as well as contribute to a better knowledge of this area, still little studied. More particularly, it aims to understand the level of implementation of recruitment and selection. Data was collected by questionnaire from 512 small and medium enterprises in Portugal, and from these, 3 hypotheses were formulated and tested using the SPSS program. From this study, the authors conclude that HRM is not yet a reality in SMEs. Recruitment and selection are the HRM practices more commonly used in SMEs, but in an informal way. © 2014 by IGI Global.

abstract={SMEs and their employed workers are the backbone for economic and competence development in Western Balkan countries. But as, SMEs are obviously lacking of productivity, lacking of resources and unlikely to higher capable human resource, in increasing liberalization of the world economy and the impact of ICT on consumer behavior demand SMEs to improve their competitiveness. Information and communication technology (ICT) has been the main focused of Balkan countries to strengthen the ICT skills of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) employees as precondition of faster implementation of new technologies and competition grow. However, scholars in resource-based view acknowledge that sustainable competitive advantage can only be achieved through building a co-specialized ICT competence between the human factors and ICT facilities in the firm. The framework developed in this paper is tested through data collected from the entrepreneurs in SMEs in Balkan countries, SME EU Charter survey, and national surveys on implementation and ICT skills upgrading. The results of desk research and statistical analysis have supported the framework proposed.},

abstract={Over the last years, many organizations including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are increasingly implementing integrated management systems (IMS) in order to development and improvement of competitiveness. IMS is a complex unit of interconnected requirements of two or more management system standards, which are incorporated into the overall corporate management system. Implementation of the integrated management system is more effective than separate implementation of management systems, such as: quality management system, environmental management system, safety and worker's health management system. With the advent of the international standard ISO 50001 - Energy Management System, which has a similar structure as ISO standards 9001, 14001 and 22000, the opportunity to integrate energy management system with other systems, has appeared. Interaction between man and machine, or the man-machine system (MMS) is an important component of production process. It is typical to consider MMS in terms of ergonomics or safety, although results of man-machine interaction may also affect the product's quality and environment. This article describes the role of MMS in an integrated management system in the small and medium-sized enterprises. © 2013 International Business Information Management Association.},

abstract={In the digital era and the era of the industrial revolution 4.0, the quality of human resources needs to be improved in order to have competencies that are in accordance with the needs of the organization. Therefore, an effective and efficient method is needed to improve employee competence by using elearning technology. This study analyzes the Diffusion of Innovation Theory through the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The study uses quantitative data obtained by surveying 400 SME employees in Indonesia using an e-learning system. Dissemination of data is by using online questionnaires through social media. Data analysis uses structural equation modeling (SEM) modeling. The results of data analysis show that the theory of diffusion of innovations mediated by intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in the UTAUT model had a significant effect. The aspects that make up the theory of diffusion of innovation significantly and directly affect the intention of SMEs employees to use the e-learning system. The findings show that the diffusion of innovation theory has various indicators for the application of learning systems and further elearning development so that they can have a real and significant impact on improving organizational performance and competitiveness. © 2022 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.},

abstract={At a global level, it is thought that organizations, which carry out innovation, are more competitive in the market and achieve a greater competitive advantage; The objective of this scientific article is to identify if innovative thinking in managers influences the competitiveness of SMEs. Currently, most research on innovation has not explored its relationship with the innovative thinking of leaders; the literature is unclear as to what innovative companies do differently to achieve superior performance. This study advances in the investigation of how the mentality of leaders influences innovation processes, for this purpose the difficulties faced by SMEs in the industrial sector in Colombia were analyzed, finding that at the country level it is not clear that there is a culture of innovative thinking in their leaders. The research was carried out under the descriptive approach, supported by qualitative and quantitative studies of a sample of Colombian SMEs. The research is associated with the analysis of data on competitiveness, innovation, and technological development in SMEs; in Colombia, the highest concentration of researchers is in the education sector with 95.7% and only 2.5% is in companies, 1.7% is outside the country. In terms of limitations, we found no evidence from studies that promote innovative thinking techniques. The practical implications of this research are to demonstrate the importance for SMEs of strengthening research in their managers and teams to generate innovation; the originality or value of this document is in promoting a model for the development of innovative thinking in leaders. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

abstract={This study aims to characterize the readiness of big data adoption and identify important factors for assessing the readiness of Vietnamese SMEs to adopt big data. Consequently, divide SMEs into specific groups based on readiness aspects in order to establish individual group-related recommendations for adopting big data. Questionnaires were used to collect data from 274 SME managers in the manufacturing and service sectors. The key factors defining the readiness of big data application in SMEs were determined by Exploratory Factor Analysis. K-mean clustering analysis was used to group SMEs. The findings highlighted that SMEs are well prepared to adopt big data in decision-making culture, customer interaction, data security, and business strategy factors but not ready in human resources, technology resources, budget resources, government support, and vendor support factors. Big data adoption readiness was defined into three dimensions, namely, Resources, Governance, and Environment readiness. The findings of this study will be important for managers, providers, and policymakers to better understand the factors that assess readiness to adopt big data in SMEs. Hence, they could build effective strategies to incorporate big data and increase their business value and competitiveness. © 2022 University of Bahrain. All rights reserved.},

abstract={At present, it has been shown that very few SMEs have knowledge of the Business Process Management BPM system, which offers a series of strategies and benefits oriented towards processes, using technology systems in terms of information management, evaluating the organizational culture and covering all the operational and business processes of the organization, in order to increase productivity and competitiveness, guaranteeing continuous improvement of internal processes following their life cycle, where they are documented, analyzed, improved, are implemented, and are monitored and controlled. In this study, the BPM culture of an information technology SME, called Management and Quality, was evaluated based on the study carried out by Jan Vom Brocke, in which 4 values are established, which are: customer orientation, excellence, responsibility, and teamwork, called CERT values, the survey adapted to the context of the company and Colombia was applied; As a result, opportunities for improvement in excellence were found represented by the dimensions of continuous improvement and innovation, and in the formal structures, dimension of teamwork, recommendations were made for these findings. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This study examines the influence of leadership on performance quality, SME employees in Malang Raya. The research population is an employee of MSMEs in Malang Raya. Significant direct effects are found in variable relationships, i.e., leadership L (X) to the quality of work-life (M1) and employee engagement (M2); and Leadership (X), work quality (M1), and employee engagement (M2) on the Human Resources (Y) working ability. Considering that the sign of the relationship coefficient is positive. For example, the more leadership level (X), the higher the quality of employee work (M1). Humans as employees, are factors in competitiveness. Human resources have a role in improving SME's development, so it is necessary to consider the leadership of the Organization to increase the work of SME employees, employees as a buffer production process so it is important to optimize SME's work. © 2021 RIGEO.

abstract={High-technology firms are a growing segment of Thailand's economy, and are critical to the innovation economy, but show few signs of adopting strategic human resources management (SHRM) practices that could improve their competitiveness. This research investigated the use of SHRM in Thai high technology firms. It used a mixed methods approach to examine the effect of strategic HRM practices including recruitment and selection, training and development, performance appraisal, compensation systems, and flexible work practices on firm outcomes of product quality, corporate reputation and innovation. It was a quantitative-led approach, incorporating HR interviews and a survey. The quantitative findings were used to evaluate the hypotheses, while the quantitative findings were used to evaluate barriers to SHRM implementation in medium and small firms. Analysis of the quantitative survey of high-tech firms (n = 312) showed that SHRM practices had significant effects on product quality (except for flexible work), reputation (except for recruitment and hiring) and innovation (except for recruitment and hiring and training and development). The strongest effect was on company reputation. ANOVA showed that large and medium firms were significantly more likely to use SHRM than small firms. Qualitative interviews with small firms (n = 10) identified several barriers to SHRM implementation, including lack of time, cost, and expertise as well as preference for traditional hiring practices. The implication of this study is that SHRM does have a benefit to technology firms in Thailand, but that small firms may not be recognizing this benefit. The major policy implication is that the Thai government needs to address knowledge and resource barriers for SMEs in the high-tech industry to enable them to use SHRM effectively. © 2021 Sriwijaya University.

abstract={Labor shortages have become widespread in Slovakia in recent years. Numerous studies deal with the difficulties of finding a skilled, motivated workforce and the difficulties of retantion. The aim of this study is to introduce the tools used by managers in HR with special regard in examining the efforts companies make to prevent burnout. The study provides a statistical analysis of the results of primary data collection on a sample of 431 SMEs the current employment policy issues in Slovakia, with a particular focus on recruitment, motivation and retention. SMEs are the engine of the European Economy, which is why it is very important that this machinery works well, is able to produce continuously and thus contribute to the economic development of the country. One of the prerequisites for this is that the human resources available to them are properly managed. Our goal is to showcase the opportunities and tools that a manager or HR department uses when it comes to employing a company, and to try to find a solution for the problem of retaining an effective workforce. Based on the obtained data related to burnout syndrome, we can conclude that 76.38% of the surveyed companies address the issue of employee burnout. 86% of the employees are at risk of burnout, since burnout is the diesease of our modern civilization. 68% of the companies struggle with more than a 15% workforce fluctuation, which can be declared a loss for the company. © 2021, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

abstract={Technology transfer is one of the tools to enhance the productivity and efficiency of businesses, thus increases competitiveness. SMEs regularly rely on external sources of technical and technological assistance. This study aims to explore factors and indicators that affect the success of technology transfer projects in Thai's SMEs. From literatures, the External factor, the Strategic and Management factor, the R&D factor, the Technological and Manufacturing factor, the Marketing factor, and the Human Resource factor were outlined. Questionnaires were distributed, and results showed positive consensus on all factors. The results also revealed new factors that were never been mentioned in previous literatures such as; an ability to find the right solution for marketing needs, an ability to understand scientific and technical elements in actual patents, and an ability to translate patent's technical data to actual production. An exploratory factor analysis clustered 8 groups of significant factors. This study provided better understanding of innovative entrepreneurial SMEs and contributed to the development of technology transfer process. © 2020 Allied Business Academies.},

abstract={Innovation is widely recognized as a key factor in the competitiveness of nations and firms. Also, it has played a significant role in business ecosystem, and the achievement of science and technology have greatly spread to the development of both local and global firms. However, there are factors that discourage the applicable capabilities of such innovations on business processes. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the degrees of barriers which block the use of innovation in the case of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam namely human resources, access to finance, transparency, tax rates, trade regulations and customs. The secondary data used were gathered from Enterprise survey (ES) of 479 small and medium enterprises in five different regions (Red River Delta, North Central Coast, Central Coast Area, South East and Mekong River Delta), which are conducted by the World Bank Group from 2015 to 2017. The binary logistic regression and Logit Model were used to process variables and data analysis. The major findings revealed that barriers of accessing financial capacity, trading regulations and customs have positively affected on innovation of SMEs in Vietnam. Finally, it could be emphasized that HR training has the strongest impact on innovation changes of the enterprises by 55.7%. © 2019 AESS Publications. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={As outlined in Malaysia Economic Transformation Program (ETP), business sector is expected to play crucial role to harness the potential of globalization and to escalate national economic growth. Considering its domination over 98% of total established businesses, SME sector become essential to drive the government's agenda. Apart from human resource, financing, innovativeness, and legal environment, availability of timely and relevant information in support of business's decision making is highly crucial for ensuring its competitiveness. Accessibility to the relevant information helps firms to lower their operating cost, to effectively manage available resources and ultimately to improve overall productivity. Information Technology/Information Systems (IT/IS) has been recognized as one of the potential means to supply information for timely business decision making. Despite growing importance of IT/IS for firm's competitiveness, SMEs embrace constant challenges to deploy IT/IS effectively and thus hardly to optimize its strategic values. Consequently, IS planning is getting paramount to promote effective management of IT/IS within SME sector. Thus, this study proposes a study that investigates the current state of IS planning practices and the factors affecting the IS Planning success among Malaysian SMEs. Adapting IS planning framework of large organizations, this study proposes IS planning framework that is applicable for SMEs environment. The developed framework could facilitate SMEs to effectively manage IS planning as to ensure greater strategic benefits of IT/IS deployment. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In order to respond to success in a rapidly changeable world, many enterprises were adopting the rules and principles of a learning organization. The issues of learning organizations are wide and multidimensional. Generally, learning organizations focus on “learning” as a crucial component in their visions, goals, values, and all of their functions. There is an opinion that by collective learning, the organization’s members are able to improve the organizations performance and competitive advantages. It is especially important for SMEs, which should be under special attention because of their special influence on economic growth, unemployment reduction, market competitiveness, etc. For learning organization the priority is that the individual learning process needs to have a voluntary rather than compulsory character. The biggest challenge for managers/owners is increasing the willingness to learn and then share new knowledge with other members of the organization. Additionally, members of the learning organization should not only accept orders from their superiors, but they need to have courage and be encouraged to question established norms to explore new avenues of thinking and to make mistakes in order to improve their products/services and production methods. From this perspective, the crucial role for building learning processes in organization is the specifically shaped relationship between superiors and employees and effective human resource management. The main aim of this paper is to identify and analyze the relations supporting and limiting organizational learning. The empirical part of the paper was prepared on the basis of questionnaire survey in 2016 on a group of 250 micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises in Poland. During the elaboration of the paper, the generally accepted methods of economic research were used, including statistical analysis (gamma correlation coefficient) and graphical illustration methods. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The development model of Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) through strengthening the aspect of business legality is unique because it connects the legality aspect with the growth and competitiveness of UMKM. The legality aspect that concerns business interests needs to be a new paradigm. The role of the state is to provide an effective regulatory framework along with monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. The government should take into consideration the fact that the support of legality aspect is needed for the SMEs where the workers are low income or are in it, while the capacity of UMKM is limited, both in terms of revenue and technology used. Data in this research will be obtained by field observation, interview and questionnaire. Resource persons and respondents in this study include the parties involved in the making of regulations and management of SMEs. The results of the research are presented in narrative form in various ways such as a deep reflection description about the regulation and policy of UMKM by the government in realizing people's prosperity The results of this study indicate that the perpetrators of UMKM have an awareness about the aspect of business legality although it is felt to increase the burden of SMEs.The perpetrators of SMEs are willing to take care of the legality of the business in the hope of obtaining legal certainty in the effort and get the facilitation and coaching from the government so as to encourage the growth of UMKM. The model of MSME development through the legality aspect of the future business needs to consider the ability to pay (ability to pay) and the principle of benefit (benefit principle). The perpetrators of MSMEs as one of the economic development actors in the regions need to be empowered through the development of human resources, capital support, production and productivity, business protection, partnership development, business and marketing network and business legality. © 2017 Serials Publications Pvt.

abstract={Small and medium industries (SMEs) in Indonesia are facing the challenge of organizational performance resources in global competition. Many studies report that human resources, production systems, can significantly improve firm's performance. This study investigates the effects of Human Resource Capability (HRC) and Production Planning Systems (PPS) on automotive and metal sectors. Specifically, in this study, the independent variables are HRC and PPS. This study also investigates these variables causal implications for organizational performance (OP). This study uses the resource-based view and dynamic capabilities theoretical framework. Out of a total of 450 sets of questionnaires distributed to top and middle managers of SMEs in the automotive and metal sector in Indonesia, 360 (80%) were usable. The study employed systematic sampling techniques and structural equation modelling (SEM) using AMOS 21 software to draw inferences and make conclusions. The results indicate that in the structural model of variables HRC and PPS have a supportive effect, whereby HRC and PPS have a supportive effect on OP. Hence, directly and indirectly HRC and PPS significantly affect the performance of the organization; good planning will result in better OP and global competitiveness. The study contributes important information for top and middle management in making better decisions, especially in dealing with HRC and PPS to improve OP. This study also contributes important for improvement models to establish SMEs to be job creation, competitive and survive as firm on regional and global level. © 2017 Serials Publications Pvt.

abstract={Knowledge and innovation are the key factors for sustainable business development. Therefore, new models of cooperation have to be launched that intensify the knowledge flow between business and academia. The Innovation Incubator at Leuphana University of Lüneburg in Germany is an excellent example for such a strategic partnership between university and regional economy. This approach of knowledge transfer is funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and focusses on strengthening the competitiveness of regional SMEs. As part of the Innovation Incubator the network for innovation and transfer “Performance Management in Medium-Sized Businesses” represents a concrete example of effective long-term cooperation between academia and business. This alliance aims at the constructive exchange of experience and knowledge between regional SMEs and academic experts in human resources and business development. One of the central questions for regional SMEs within this network is how to attract and recruit highly qualified employees. Within research-based working groups academic experts closely cooperate with business representatives in order to increase the employer attractiveness of SMEs. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

This project follows the logic of the European Lisbon Strategy which was implemented by the European Council to improve research and development policy and to strengthen regional business development. Given this target, the European structural funds were redesigned for the funding period 2007 until 2013 and “convergence” in terms of economic homogeneity has been defined as the top priority (so called objective 1). The region of Lüneburg has been declared an “objective 1 area” and is the only area which fits the definition of a convergence region within the western states of Germany (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie 2007, p. 5).},

abstract={Baturaden is a mountainous tourism object located in Purwokerto Central Java Indonesia. This object is among popular tourism destinations in the region. The presence of Baturraden brings multiplier effect to its surrounding such as handicraft traders, hotels and restaurants. There are substantial numbers of small medium enterprises (SME) producing handicrafts operating in the area. To increase the competitiveness of SMEs, it is necessary to integrate the entire existing potential of the object and turning it into a force that is highly competitive and innovative. The purpose of this study are multi facets: first, to evaluate of the marketing concepts and selling behavior of SMEs; secondly, to determine the key successful factors that are required in order to implement the Integrated Tourism Model; third, to propose an integrated tourism marketing model for SMEs based on the creative economy development of Baturraden tourist attraction. Based on observations, surveys and in-depth interviews with respondents, it appears that there are several forms of constraints faced by SMEs in the area, namely marketing, human resources, financial, and operational factors. Based on the description and analysis of the weighting, marketing factor is the biggest obstacle in the development of Baturraden tourism attraction. Among the strength of Baturraden tourist attraction is tourists can experience the beauty of nature in the area along with business, art and culture uniqueness of Banyumas.},

abstract={Introduction The contextual environment of an enterprise was defined as all external factors that affect or have potential impact on its functioning (Thompson, 1967; Emery and Trist, 1965). Moreover, for Khandwalla (1977), the environment is also the source of constraints, unforeseen problems and opportunities. In this sense, Lenz (1978: 32) argues that the environment can be defined as a “source of trends and events that create opportunities and threats for enterprises.” In fact, the environment is a multidimensional concept consisting of market factors, government regulations, technology, innovation and availability of scarce and critical resources. However, on the opportunities for the environment, Mavondo (1999) concludes that the attractiveness of the business environment determines the effective organizational strategies, increases the importance of market direction and increases the importance of human resource management. Moreover, it leads to greater investment to reduce manufacturing costs and is related positively to financial performance. Furthermore, in emerging and developing countries, specifically countries in transition to the market economy, White and Linden (2002) report that market liberalization – policy-induced opening of the global environment – requires a wide range of changes in businesses formerly protected and often regulated. This new environment is generally characterized by a dramatic change in the basis of competition and business viability. It affects most economic activities. To address the problem of environmental disadvantages in emerging and developing countries, governments have developed programs to “upgrade” businesses. The purposes of these programs are to improve firms’ performance and competitiveness both nationally and internationally. These objectives require the adaptation of the immediate environment to the enterprise, but also action within the enterprise itself (Bouzidi, 2010). Indeed, the role of governments to upgrade the sector of small business in emerging and developing countries is substantial. This role is in providing an economic legal and regulatory climate, and policies suitable for the development of small business. This vital sector mainly contributes to the promotion of the economic framework, promotes job security, well-being of the population as a whole and social and political stability (Julien, 1994; Mawardi et al., 2011) Governments in these countries have expended phenomenal human and material resources. For example, Malaysia has spent $8 billion to upgrade some 287,000 SMEs. Currently, Algeria has committed $5 billion to upgrade 20,000 small-and medium-sized businesses in its five-year economic program for 2010-2014 (Habaradas, 2008; Mebtoul, 2010). In fact, from this perspective, Bennaceur et al. (2007) define the upgrade by the adaptation of structures, resources and management processes of small business to improve their performance and enhance their ability to compete in national and international markets. Similarly, for experts of the United Nations Organization for Industrial Development (UNIDO), the objective of upgrading or adapting businesses is twofold: “Action to improve business performance in terms of production and growth and also improving competitiveness to enable it to fight effectively in its new competitive field and to grow” (quoted in Madoui and Boukrif, 2009: 5). In this chapter we discuss three concepts: The upgrade, the adaptation and the performance of small business. Therefore, the objective of this work is to determine whether the upgrade has an effect on adaptation and performance of small businesses in emerging and developing countries. To answer this research question, we begin with an overview of the concepts of upgrading and adaptation. From this perspective, we attempt to integrate the conceptual models discussed in an integrative framework that allow us to understand this phenomenon theoretically. We now proceed to discuss the link between adaptation and performance in a changing environment. We focus in particular on the situation of small business. We shall rely mainly on the work of entrepreneurship scholars. We shall also address the adaptation experiences of small business in the world, mainly in emerging and developing countries, emerging markets of Southeast Asia and countries in transition in Eastern Europe, ending with North African experiences. This section concludes with a synthesis and integration recounting the highlights and key successes of upgrading, adaptation and performance of the cases studied. Thus, we conclude this work by discussing the integrative concepts studied. We end with a short conclusion. In this introduction we present a brief description of contingency theory, which explains an adaptive behavior of an organization in its contextual environment. Contingency theory takes into account both the organization and its environment and assumes that entrepreneurs are rational and responsible for changing the characteristics of the enterprise to adapt to the level of uncertainty in the environment. Entrepreneurs are assumed to be rational and they can buy or deploy the necessary resources to ensure business performance. In this theory, entrepreneurs have some level of discretion (Burns and Stalker, 1961; Woodward, 1965; Thompson, 1967; Lawrence and Lorsh, 1969). © 2014 selection and editorial material, Elie Virgile Chrysostome and Rick Molz; individual chapters, the contributors.},

abstract={The Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME) sector represents the engine of any economy, especially in a crisis period. In a turbulent economic environment, the SMEs adapt themselves easier, have high competitiveness, and resistance levels. In the same time, the success and stability of a company depend on the way its resources (materials, finance, information, technology, energy, employees) are used. Because of their importance, the human resources activities need a special consideration. The paper presents the results of a survey regarding the human resources practices conducted in the last part of year 2011 within 100 SMEs from the development region Bucharest-Ilfov.},

abstract={In the wake of 21st century, Low-tech industry is still the footstone of China economic development. Low-tech industry has become the pillar industry of national economy over the past 30 years of rapid growth, while labor-intensive products with low technology content and value-added will be the focus of low-tech sector. Confronted with increasingly intensive technology competition and excessive production capacity of manufacture industry worldwide, more and more enterprises realize it is urgent to find new development way. This text analyzes the development condition, opportunities and challenges of China low-tech sector based on Dongguan textile & garment industry. A basic qualitative and quantitative approach to the competitiveness of low tech industry is sketched out by production capacity and efficiency, innovation, human resource and market environment. The significance of low-tech industry for processes of economic development is stressed. In the conclusion I suggest that it is necessary to set up technology innovation mechnism to serve for SMEs and complete the basic work of business management. It is urgent for the government to formulate the relative law and policy to eliminate the system obstacles of industry cluster and encourage low-tech firms "go abroad" to implement internationalization strategy. This is a realistic way of promoting the healthy development of China low-tech industry to cope with the internal disturbance and foreign aggression under the financial crises.},

abstract={Today, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular have to face various challenges due to the accelerating changes of external influences and internal factors. On the external side they have to consider aspects as the ever-changing market requirements and technological advances and at the same time they have to deal with knowledge management and personnel structure to name examples for internal factors. In order to confront this challenge the development of products, processes and technologies has to be at the core of innovation efforts. This task is difficult to implement for most SMEs located in the low-tech sector due to the fact that they seldom have a separate R&D department. Therefore, it is mandatory to design an efficient process for the perception of innovation to ensure the competitiveness on the market.},

abstract={In the networked economy firms are recognizing the power of the Internet as a platform for creating different forms of relationships and collaborations aimed to enhance value and achieve a sustainable competitive advantage. Digital Marketplaces represent one of the most powerful solutions adopted by firms to support the networking practices among firms, especially among SMEs. However in developing countries the potentialities of digital marketplaces remains largely unexploited. Different human, organizational and technological factors, issues and problems pertain in these countries, requiring focused studies and appropriate approaches. This article argues that in order for firms in developing countries to benefit from digital marketplace platforms it is necessary to root them in an assessment study which permits to understand the firms preparedness to use the digital marketplace in terms of technological infrastructure, human resources' capabilities and skills, integration and innovation level among firms. Based on the outcomes of this assessment it is then possible to find out a viable digital marketplace model that fits with actual readiness status of firms and helps them to develop progressively the necessary resources and capabilities to enhance their competitiveness in the current digital economic landscape.},
