 Suggestion that bank directors owe a broader duty of care is meant to suggest that bank directors have fiduciary duties to depositors as well as to shareholders. The significance of this suggestion is that it would mediate between the interests of equityholders who would prefer a higher risk profile for the bank and the deposit-holders who would prefer a lower risk profile
 Id. at 102. The classic articulation of directors' duties looks to the protection of shareholders' interests and only as an institution begins to approach insolvency does diat duty broaden to encompass debt-holders. For a detailed discussion of the potentially differing perspectives of protecting shareholder interests and debt-holder and depositor interests
