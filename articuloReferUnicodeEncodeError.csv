Although showing signs of advance, most of the existing literature still relies, to a great extent, on case studies and conceptual frameworks, with little empirical research in the specific context of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This paper adds to the literature by empirically assessing the effects of organizational antecedents and innovation climate on OI as well as its consequences on firm performance in SMEs. In addition, the moderating roles of environmental dynamisms and competitiveness in the relationships between innovation climate and inbound and outbound OI are analyzed. To achieve these goals, this paper develops an integrative research model, which analyses the network relations using covariance-based structural equation modeling (SEM) on a data set of 429 Spanish SMEs. Results revealed that organizational factors such as commitment-based human resources practices have a positive influence on innovation climate and that innovation climate contributes to both inbound and outbound OI. Another important finding is that contingent factors such as environmental dynamism strengthen the positive effect of innovation climate on outbound OI. The main conclusions of this research can be valuable to SMEs that implement or intend to implement OI. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.|Moderators, Conceptual frameworks; Empirical research; Environmental dynamisms; Innovation management; Open innovation; Organizational factors; Small and medium enterprise; Structural equation modeling, Innovation, competitiveness; human resource; industrial performance; innovation; organizational framework; small and medium-sized enterprise|cited By 221|Department of Business Administration and Management, Catholic University of Murcia, Campus de los Jerónimos, Guadalupe, Murcia 30107, Spain; Department of Management & Finance, University of Murcia, Campus de Espinardo, Espinardo, Murcia 30100, Spain; Department of Financial Economics and Accounting, University of Murcia, Campus de Espinardo, Espinardo, Murcia 30100, Spain|English|
Journal Article|Singh RK,Garg SK,Deshmukh SG|Q1||The competitiveness of SMEs in a globalized economy: Observations from China and India|Management Research Review|2010|33|1|54-65|||2010|||2040-8269|http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/01409171011011562|10.1108/01409171011011562|Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze different challenges for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in India and China following globalization. It aims to describe the status of these enterprises and examine the roles of government policies and strategy development for competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire-based survey was conducted, which produced 241 valid responses. Of these, 80 percent were from SMEs. Statistical analysis of the data acquired from survey used a reliability test, t-test and correlation analysis. A relevant literature review pinpoints salient issues in the environment of the SMEs. Findings - The governments of China and India have launched various promotional schemes for SMEs. Various challenges for SMEs in these countries are similar; however, the rate of growth is different. Indian SMEs give more attention to supplier development, total productive maintenance and the organization's culture. Chinese SMEs pay more attention to relationship management and cost reduction. Human resource development and quality improvement are also highly correlated with competitiveness. Research limitations/implications - SMEs should focus on developing their human resources and improving product quality. This effort will help SMEs retain human capital as well as increase the demand for their products. Similar studies could explore Chinese SMEs in-depth for additional comparisons. Originality/value - This paper will help SMEs in shaping their competitive strategies and policy formulation by respective governments. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.||cited By 152|Mechanical Engineering Department, Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India; Mechanical Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India|English|

Design/methodology/approach – The paper provides an overview of the evolution of innovation within the economic and management literatures. It then examines previous work on human resource management (HRM), HRD and innovation. The paper then provides a brief overview of the articles for this issue focussing on HRD and innovation. Findings – HRD interventions can positively contribute to organisation's innovation activities. HRD is also found to positively influence employee engagement, leadership, manager's motivation to learn, the promotion of a learning culture, and social capital development all of which are positively associated with innovation. Informal HRD and access to mentors and coaches is shown to be critical for innovation in SMEs. Originality/value – This paper provides an introduction to this special issue on HRD and innovation. It shows that this has been an under- researched area and it also emphasises that HRD and its relationship with innovation must be analysed within the context of the organisation's culture, its context, and its leadership capabilities. The four conceptual contributions provide a rich road map for future research on HRD and innovation. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited||cited By 51|National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland; Kemmy Business School, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland|English|

Managers in power, involved in the construction project life cycle, create rules for the game and are the main players. The project's success can be perceived differently by stakeholders. A company's competitiveness, successful implementation of the projects and effective safety management depends on the strategic allocation of its human resources in order to select a proper project team in alignment with employee capabilities. This requires detailed factors reflecting their role (in line with their interests and attitudes) and knowing which of them has a decisive influence on the successful implementation of the project. The real data describing key factors in this concept can be provided as uncertain conditions. This work presents a novel integrated modified fuzzy group decision- making approach to select and rank the most influential persons ensuring the sustainable prevention of accidents at work in the small and medium-sized construction enterprises. This model includes the Delphi method and fuzzy extensions of Eckenrode's criteria rating method. The proposed model could be expanded in order to select the most suitable individuals for sustainable management of safety and, moreover, for the effective implementation of safety and health measures. © 2019.||cited By 40|Faculty of Civil Engineering, Vilnius Gediminas Technical University, Sauletekio al. 11, Vilnius, 10223, Lithuania; University of Oradea, Universitatii, 1, Oradea, 410087, Romania|English|

A successful CIM initiative in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) must have top management involvement and commitment and a CIM compatible organizational infrastructure which includes requisite skills, appropriate training and education, and adequate incentives and rewards. Top management must commit the resources necessary to acquire needed technology and bring about any necessary changes in the organizational infrastructure. Top management must likewise be willing to accept the long-term consequences of their decisions. SMEs play an increasingly important role in the competitiveness of many industries in the areas of product and process innovation, flexibility, and in the development of innovative management methods, organizational conventions, and human resource practices. One of the ways that SMEs can achieve a competitive advantage in manufacturing is through the implementation of CIM. To promote a better understanding of organizational issues pertaining to the implementation of CIM in SMEs, a framework is proposed for use in examining and explaining the organizational ramifications of CIM. A literature review and an empirical study provide the foundation for the proposed framework.||cited By 39|Department of Management, University of Massachusetts, North Dartmouth, MA 02747-2300, United States; Department of Systems Engineering, Brunel University, Uxbridge, Middlesex UB8 3PH, United Kingdom; Department of Business and Economics, Arkansas Technological University, Russellville, AR 72801, United States|English|

Obtaining and, just as importantly, mastering scientific and technological information is therefore essential to competitiveness of all SMEs. During the last two decades, several factors have forced global manufacturers to make dramatic changes in their products, markets, and manufacturing strategies. One of the ways by which SMEs can achieve a competitive advantage in manufacturing is through the implementation of computer integrated manufacturing (CIM). Realising the importance of SMEs, an attempt has been made in this paper to study the implementation of CIM in SMEs. First, the characteristics of CIM have been studied with reference to the application and infrastructure of SMEs. Secondly, a framework has been presented for the implementation of CIM in SMEs with the help of a conceptual model. Finally, future research directions on CIM in SMEs are indicated.|Competition; Mathematical models; Process engineering; Production engineering; Systems engineering, Small and medium enterprises (SME), Computer integrated manufacturing|cited By 38|Department of Manufacturing, Brunel University, Uxbridge, Middlesex, United Kingdom; Department of Manufacturing, Brunel University, Uxbridge, Middlesex UB8 3PH, United Kingdom|English|

The purpose of this paper is to develop and test a conceptual framework connecting socially responsible human resource management (SRHRM) to competitive performance that fits small business. Design/methodology/approach: In order to get empirical evidence, structural equation modeling technique was applied on the data from 481 Spanish SMEs. Findings: Results confirm both the direct contribution of SRHRM to business competitiveness and the multiple effects resulting from including two variables of additional interest for the relationship under study: employee’s commitment and relational marketing. Practical implications: One of the main research limitations is that the paper only reflects the perceptions of owners/managers of SMEs. Although it was believed that the respondents give reliable and accurate information about the way their firms are involved in CSR practices, there is a possibility that they might provide incorrect or incomplete information. Originality/value: The relationships proposed have never been studied before in context of SMEs. This is a worthwhile endeavor, which makes an empirical contribution. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.||cited By 36|Department of Business Organization, Cadiz University, Jerez de la Frontera, Spain; Department of Financial Economics and Operations Management, University of Seville, Seville, Spain; Department of Financial Economics and Accounting, Cadiz University, Cadiz, Spain|English|

The study also seeks to evaluate other factors that allow or condition the use of ITC such as: human resources, collaboration of the industrial sector, and local environment. Design/methodology/approach: These effects are examined through an empirical research of 100 small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from a developing country - Peru. Findings: SMEs from developing countries follow an isomorphic approach. This is because they tend to imitate or copy the better practices from developed countries. The results have shown that ITCs have a positive effect on the international competitiveness of firms. Research limitations/implications: A limitation is the cross-sectional character of this research. Practical implications: Firms use ITC to manage their inventory, for the communication between manufacturers and offices, and suppliers, for bill payments, and for the management of sales and marketing, and for the management of their networks. Originality/value: According to the literature reviewed, this study is one of the pioneers in contrasting empirically whether the use of ITC contributes positively to the international competitiveness of firms in the developing countries of Latin America. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.||cited By 33|Department of Business Management and Marketing, University of Seville, Seville, Spain; Department of Decision and Information Sciences, C.T.

They account for 80% of global economic growth. Market conditions have dramatically changed for Indian SMEs after economic reforms. SMEs are regularly facing new challenges in terms of cost, quality, delivery, flexibility and human resource development for their survival and growth. In the context of a dynamic market scenario, they have to formulate their strategies for developing various capabilities and competencies to satisfy their domestic as well as global customers. For long-term competitiveness, SMEs have to focus on all aspects of organisational functions such as assets, strategy development, processes and their performance. This study tries to illustrate this concept with the help of a case study. It is observed that to be competitive, SMEs should have clarity of mission and should proactively develop their human resources and competencies to meet fast changing customer requirements.

In this context, industrial small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) need to collaborate with the service sector to enhance their competitiveness and strategic capabilities. Indeed, industrial service SMEs have been the object of particular attention from governments since these enterprises have become a key element for manufacturing and innovation networks in developed countries. However, these firms, as well as the manufacturing SMEs they serve, now face the challenge to internationalize. This paper addresses the of the strategic capabilities required by SMEs in general, and manufacturing and industrial service SMEs in particular, to internationalize, as well as the effect of these capabilities on their export performance. These strategic capabilities are presented in a research model, which relates human resources (HR), product development capabilities and market development capabilities to export performance. In testing this model with a sample of 347 Canadian and French SMEs, similarities and differences between the two types of SMEs are highlighted. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.||cited By 29|Institut de recherche sur les PME, Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières, 3351, boul. des Forges C.P. 500, Trois-Rivières, QC G9A 5H7, Canada|English|

Several factors were identified and their interactions with digital technologies within the production environments was analysed. These factors, from an organisational perspective were identified as critical to success in the quest to achieve Industry 4.0 compliance and digital transformation of the manufacturing operations of companies. They include: strategy, organisational fit, competitiveness, operations and human resources. A mixed methods approach was adopted for the research. It involved both the qualitative and quantitative methodological approaches. The qualitative aspect involved an extensive systematic review of relevant literature which was useful in developing the conceptual framework and identifying the relevant factors that enable the implementation of an efficient Industry 4.0 process management model in SMEs; the quantitative aspect involved the use of a survey questionnaire to collect data which was analysed using confirmatory factor analysis statistical approach to test the measures of the constructs in the proposed conceptual framework. The result from the statistical analysis shows the factors that in the conceptual model that were supported as being relevant in achieving an efficient process management model for successful implementation of Industry 4.0 concepts in Czech manufacturing SMEs. The research limitation is based on the fact that the SMEs covered in the quantitative aspect of the research are restricted to a particular geographical location – Czech Republic. It would be interesting to have similar studies conducted in other geographies for a comparative perspective. It contributes to the scientific and practical discourse on Industry 4.0 process management model implementation in SMEs by investigating the phenomenon through the production of credible scientific evidence. © 2020 The Author(s).||cited By 27|Dept of Industrial Engineering, Faculty of Management and Economics, Tomas Bata University, Zlin, Czech Republic|English|

Design/methodology/approach - The empirical research was conducted in Spanish SMEs. A questionnaire was distributed among managers of these companies. Thus, with a final sample of 481 cases and using consistent partial least squares structural equation modelling, direct and mediating effects were tested. In particular, relationships among corporate social performance (CSP) (exogenous variable), competitive performance (endogenous variable), relational marketing (mediating variable) and innovative capacity (mediating variable) were hypothesized. Moreover, a further analysis about the superior returns offered by socially responsible practices related to core business stakeholders was conducted. Findings - The results highlight a significant and positive effect that CSP has on competitive performance. Additionally, both mediating positive effects were supported and the firm size was checked as a relevant control variable which, as proxy for resources availability, affects all constructs used with the exception of relational marketing. Managers interested in a strategic approach to social responsibility should be aware that the investment in activities related to employees and customers leads to higher competitiveness. Research limitations/implications - The study was limited to SME in Spain. Moreover, information related to competitive performance was gathered from managers' own perceptions, considering the performance of their direct competitors as a reference level. Originality/value - To the authors knowledge, no research studies were found that empirically examined the business case in SMEs and employed a CSR approach based on stakeholders' perspective. Therefore, the main contribution of this research is to show how socially responsible management of SMEs leads to higher competitive performance both direct and indirectly, using two strategic variables suggested in literature on large corporations. Despite their resources limitations, this kind of organizations is in a favourable position to engage with different stakeholders and benefit from their relationships, especially with employees and customers. © Emerald Publishing Limited.|Commerce; Human resource management; Least squares approximations; Managers; Marketing, Business case; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Partial least square (PLS); Small and medium sized enterprise; Stakeholder theory; Structural equation modelling, Economic and social effects|cited By 26|Department of Finance and Accounting, University of Cádiz, Cádiz, Spain; Department of Business and Management, University of Cádiz, Cádiz, Spain|English|

Design/methodology/approach – It is a mixed-method study with two consecutive phases. In Phase I, 30 Hong Kong SMEs identified through theoretical sampling were classified into three life-cycle stages – inception, high growth and maturity. In Phase II, their employees’ learning practices (grouped by learning levels) were statistically compared using the analysis of variance and then followed up for confirmation with qualitative semi-structured interviews. Findings – This study uniquely suggests the nature of a relationship between SME organisational learning and the OLC. Empirical results show that three of the four learning levels (individual, group, organisational and inter-organisational) practised in SMEs are varied in importance between life-cycle stages. Research limitations/implications – Comparative studies are encouraged in other parts of the world to strengthen the findings – with either SMEs or large organisations. Practical implications – The study informs SME owner/managers about what is important for employee learning at different business stages so that appropriate learning strategies or human resource development policies can be formulated in a timely fashion to promote competitiveness. Originality/value – It is among the first studies to connect SME learning with organisational growth. The relationships found serve as a sound foundation for further empirical investigations. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.||cited By 24|Fort Hays State University, Hays, KS, United States; University of Greenwich, London, United Kingdom|English|

This study draws on the RBV perspective to empirically examine the association between SME e-commerce investments and firm performance. We collected firm-level data from 430 British SMEs across 16 industry sectors. Results demonstrate that RBV provides strong theoretical support, that is, business resources, human resources, and external resources (i.e. e-commerce readiness) strongly contribute to enhanced firm performance. The sophistication of SMEs' e-commerce websites contribute to firm performance, but those firms' capital investments in IT and e-commerce training per se are not significant performance drivers. Our findings suggest that UK SMEs can and do differentiate themselves on the basis of their e-commerce capability, which is created by the synergistic combination of e-commerce resources with other organisational resources and capabilities. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.|competitiveness; electronic commerce; industrial competition; industrial performance; information and communication technology; investment; small and medium-sized enterprise, United Kingdom|cited By 23|School of Economics, Peking University, Haidian District, Beijing, 100871, China; Manchester Business School (Asia-based), China Centre, 1376 Nanjing West Road, Shanghai, 200040, China|English|

Coming out of the great financial crisis, initiatives to nurture their (export) competitiveness have been high on the political agenda. In this vein, a growing literature explores the pertinence of firm-specific factors for explaining differences in SMEs’ export behavior. However, the puzzle of how intangible, knowledge- based assets, such as human and relational capital, contribute to establishing a viable position in export markets remains. By synthesizing empirical evidence from 167 studies, this meta-analytic path analysis reveals significant differential direct and indirect effects of human and relational capital endowment on dimensions of export behavior. Concurrently, our analysis uncovered that positive influences of intangible assets are context- dependent. In fact, human resources appear to be particularly pertinent for exporting SMEs in developing economies. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.||cited By 22|Department of Economics and Business, Chair of Strategic and International Management, Justus- Liebig-University Giessen, Licher Strasse 62, Giessen, 35394, Germany|English|

The purpose of this paper is to study the development of various competencies by small-, medium- and large-scale Indian organizations under various pressures and constraints. Design/methodology/approach – For collecting data, a questionnaire-based survey were conducted. Out of 241 responding organizations, 193 were small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and 48 were larger organizations. Statistical analysis of data acquired from the survey are done by reliability test, t-test and correlation analysis. Findings – Introduction of new technology and identification of market changes have emerged as most important competencies because they are significantly correlated with subjective performance, objective performance and overall competitiveness of organization. Levels of focus given on competencies development by large organizations differ significantly from SMEs. Research limitations/implications – Findings of the study imply that SMEs should be as proactive as large organizations in making changes in terms of various processes such as development of competencies, human resources, upgrading of technology and awareness about market changes. For validating these results, further case studies are recommended.

Sustainable development is based on preventive management principles, and their application in SMEs has become an important issue for enhancing competitiveness. Unfortunately, most of the sustainable development-related research is focused on large companies rather than SMEs, especially in the industrial sector. The importance of SMEs often remains unnoticed. Besides, SMEs themselves often have inadequate knowledge about their environmental and social impacts and management, and apply voluntary preventive measures less frequently than large companies. To make sustainable decisions and to improve the environmental performance, economic and social effectiveness of SMEs, an integrated sustainable management system (SMS) based on financial analysis is necessary, oriented to strategic sustainability goals, not requiring significant financial and human resources. Integration of sustainability management accounting and composite sustainable development index methodologies forms the basis of SMS for SMEs decision making. SMS was applied in three pilot SMEs (small-scale wood parquet, medium-scale wood pallets, medium-scale beverage producing companies). In this article, an extensive analysis of a small- scale wood parquet manufacturing company's case is presented. The application of SMS enabled to identify key sustainability problems and to find solutions to improve the companies' sustainability performance. SMS application resulted in reduced input materials consumption and the reduction of sustainability costs. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.|Decision making; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Industrial research; Planning, Environmental management accountings; Environmental performance; Management principles; Manufacturing companies; Small and medium enterprise; Sustainability managements; Sustainability performance; Sustainable management, Sustainable development|cited By 19|Institute of Environmental Engineering, Kaunas University of Technology, Teatro 8-16, Vilnius 03107, Lithuania; Institute of Environmental Engineering, Kaunas University of Technology, K.

New technologies are by and large dominated by ICTs. Data for the analysis come from sixty-seven SMEs located in Aba, Ibadan, Lagos and Nnewi. One of the major factors inhibiting ICT diffusion and intensive utilisation is poor physical infrastructure represented by adequate and uninterrupted electricity supply and communication connectivity infrastructure. Findings of multivariate analysis suggest that firm-level variables such as financial capacity and technological absorptive capacity influenced the intensity of the adoption of ICTs. The results also suggest that globalisation of the Nigerian economy also influenced the adoption of new technologies. The study concludes that SMEs need institutional support in terms of human resource development for the augmentation of their competitiveness in the domestic as well as international markets.|competitiveness; globalization; human resource; information and communication technology; institutional development; multivariate analysis; small and medium-sized enterprise; technology adoption; technology diffusion; technology transfer, Aba; Abia; Africa; Anambra; Ibadan; Lagos [Nigeria]; Nigeria; Nnewi; Oyo; Sub- Saharan Africa; West Africa|cited By 19|UNU, MERIT, Keizer Karelplein 19, 6211 TC Maastricht, Netherlands|English|

This article explores the nexus between knowledge-based HRM practices, knowledge management capacity, intellectual capital, product and process innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Design/Methodology/Approach: Data were gleaned from 250 registered SMEs in Jordan using a simple random sampling technique. A covariance structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) was deployed in testing the proposed research model. Results: The findings cast light on the positive influence of knowledge-based HRM practice of SMEs on SMEs knowledge management capacity, intellectual capital and, product and process innovation. Similarly, knowledge management capacity SMEs exerts positive impact on their intellectual capital and, product and process innovation. Intellectual capital also emerges as a strong predictor for SMEs product and process innovation. Finally, a serial indirect effect (mediation) of knowledge management capacity and intellectual capital on the relationship between knowledge-based HRM practice of SMEs and, product and process innovation were revealed. Conclusion: Knowledge-based HRM practices and innovation have received vast amount of research attention, yet there is a lack of understanding on the process by which the former leads to the latter. Drawing on knowledge-based view (KBV) theory, this study is among the first attempts to unveil the structural process between knowledge-based HRM practices and innovation through knowledge management capacity and intellectual capital. This study theoretically validated the KBV framework in a non-Western context and demonstrate the importance of knowledge-based HRM practices for SMEs innovativeness. The findings do not only provide useful insights for managers and scholars, but also serve as the building block for future research. © 2019 Mohammad Jaber Yousef Al-Tal et al.||cited By 16|Girne American University, Faculty of Economics and Business, Business Management Department, Via Mersin 10, North-Cyprus, Turkey|English|

CPS are key technology building blocks for the implementation of Industrie 4.0. Especially for SMEs the increase of production efficiency and reduction of manufacturing costs through CPS offer potential to maintain their competitiveness and innovation capacity. Although SMEs perceive the potential of CPS, they often lack financial and human resources to acquire the necessary CPS- competencies as well as an overview of all the currently available technological solutions. To overcome this issue a matching platform will offer SMEs support in finding suitable CPS-components by letting them express their functional and technical requirements. The matching logic is based on a set of morphologies that encompasses the functional and requirement spectrum of CPS-components. The matching algorithm analyses the input for congruence of requirements and available technologies and suggests suitable technology combinations. This paper describes the methodology of the matching platform, and introduces the research work to define and to develop the technology morphologies. The presented results facilitate the selection and configuration of CPS for SMEs. © 2017 IEEE.|Cyber Physical System; Engineering research; Manufacture, Cyber-Physical System (CPS); Innovation capacity; Manufacturing industries; Matching algorithm; Production efficiency; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Technical requirement; Technological solution, Embedded systems|cited By 14; Conference of 2017 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, PICMET 2017 ; Conference Date: 9 July 2017 Through 13 July 2017; Conference Code:133466|FIR Institute for Industrial Management, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany|English|

This study aims to analyze whether the concept of innovative work behavior can mediate the relationship of person-job fit, person-organization fit and person- group fit to job performance. The study was conducted in the metal SME industry in Tegal Regency, with 256 respondents. Data collection tools use questionnaires and interviews. Data analysis is done with a structural equation model. Based on the results of the analysis, there is a positive relationship between variables. This illustrates that the challenges of SMEs in the future are to maintain the best human resources to remain committed to the organization. In maintaining its existence, alignment of individual values with work, organization and groups is the best tool to achieve goals through innovative changes in employee behavior, and also to lay a solid foundation in the recruitment and selection process of new employees that have the potential to increase job performance. © 2020 The Author(s).||cited By 13|Universitas 17 Agustus 1945, Semarang, Indonesia|English|

As a result, human capital is regarded as the most important asset, and therefore, in order to grow and prosper, SMEs need to embrace the strategic approach to the human resource management (HRM) which should, in return, increase their competitiveness and responsiveness to the market changes. The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of strategic human resource (HR) practices on organisational performance. The results of hierarchical regression used to test the hypothesis supported the relationship between strategic HR practices and business performance.

Thus, one of the challenges that organizations currently face is to find a strategy to retain and attract talent. To overcome this difficulty, enterprises must invest in employer branding policies and be aware of the factors that differentiate them from others when attracting employees. This study aims to develop an employer branding model applicable to SMEs, to increase and enhance the attraction and retention of talents. An exploratory approach based on a quantitative perspective was adopted to develop an employer branding model applied to SMEs, with two major reference employer branding models and frameworks used as the main support. The model of employer branding was applied to SMEs regarding four dimensions, whereby essential questions are asked, namely (1) organizational culture (e.g., do employees have a job description aligned with the corporate culture?), (2) company strategy (e.g., what is the strategy if business volume decreases?), (3) company reputation (e.g., how do you perceive and treat negative feedback?), and (4) reward systems (e.g., do you feel that your employees are motivated intrinsically or extrinsically or both?), ordered by layers based on a logical sequence. The new proposed model is expected to serve as a useful strategic tool and as a basis for attracting, retaining and managing talent, specifically in the SMEs context. This new model provides a set of strategic and competitiveness benefits for SMEs, while contributing to making enterprises more profitable. The model also contributes to SMEs having a better image and reputation, enabling them to stand out from others in the war for talent. © 2020 by the authors.

As well, to propose a model suited to the characteristics of the small business. The information is collected from 22 Basque Country SMEs grouped into industrial clusters, through a survey that is conducted to identify the use of practices related to knowledge management. Results show that informal practices figure prominently in the day to day of the SME and that the knowledge management process is not standardized but that is performed by the collaborative work between people, among others. Besides, the size of the SME acts as a factor in regard to the level of formality in knowledge management process. This study helps SME managers understand where the organizational knowledge is found within organizations and, consequently, to not neglect the importance of people in keeping competitiveness high.

There are large-scale knowledge management systems (KMS) covering the full functionality for facilitating the effectiveness and productivity of employees. These systems are frequently integrated into other organisation's management systems. But the most of the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) cannot afford to use these KMS, and also the full functionality of these KMS is not necessary for them. Thus, the solution is to combine the parts of cloud based knowledge management systems with business process information systems that jointly propel the business core of the enterprise. This paper investigates the architecture of different cloud based solutions for knowledge management to define the possibilities of cross- system integrations. © 2017 The Authors.|Competition; Human resource management; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Management science, Business process information; Cloud-based; Cross systems; Knowledge management system; Major factors; Management systems; Small and medium sized enterprise, Information management|cited By 8; Conference of ICTE 2016 ; Conference Code:134528|University of Latvia, 19 Raina Blvd., Riga, LV-1586, Latvia|English|

Research Design & Methods: The study is based on a complementary data set derived from secondary (AMADEUS database) and primary sources of information (com-puter assisted telephone interviews with top managers) for 553 micro, small and medium firms located in Poland. We conduct a cluster analysis to identify different internationalization profiles of SMEs for the years 2010-2013. Findings: In the year of the global economic crisis ambitious investors on average had at their disposal substantially better competitive potential than the remaining two groups. Ambitious exporters were better equipped than cautious internationalizers only in terms of human resources, intangible resources and quality control. Implications & Recommendations: Policy support should be particularly oriented towards supplying information about foreign markets and fostering firms in an optimal allocation of their resources. Contribution & Value Added: The study suggests that the strategy of diversifying international markets during the economic crisis and recovery can be a means of improving performance and reducing excessive dependence on fluctuations in key markets. © 2018, Cracow University of Economics.

This contrasts with previous studies that mainly focus on employee motivation, job retention, and turnover. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted face-to- face with founder Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). The results suggest that an important factor influencing job retention policies of these SMEs was to motivate employees to make greater voluntary effort, including through developing a collaborative organizational culture, rather than solely offering them additional financial rewards or using other Human Resource Management (HRM) practices to improve individual performances. Interviewees believed that job retention and business growth were closely related, and they discussed various ways of eliciting emotional commitment from employees. Unlike research on larger firms, these suggestions did not involve immediate financial rewards. How employers thought that the roles played by employees strongly influenced their firm's productivity and competitiveness. This study suggests SME employers adjust their retention policy specifically to improve their firm's survival and long-term growth. © 2019 by the authors.|business development; engineering; firm size; growth rate; human resource; information technology; labor policy; perception; resource management; small and medium-sized enterprise, South Korea|cited By 7|Management Work and Organization Division, Stirling Management School, University of Stirling, Scotland, FK9 4LA, United Kingdom; Department of Business Administration, Sogang University, Seoul, 04107, South Korea|English|

But SMEs, particularly in developing countries like India, face constraints in key areas such as technology, finance, marketing and human resources. Moreover these SMEs have been exposed to intense competition since early 1990s because of globalization. However, globalization, the process of continuing integration of the countries in the world has opened up new opportunities for SMEs of developing countries to cater to wider international market which brings out the need for these SMEs to develop competitiveness for their survival as well as growth. It is observed from literature that pursuing appropriate IM practice is one of the ways of acquiring competitiveness among others, by effectively managing and minimizing inventory investment. Inventory management can therefore be one of the crucial determinants of competitiveness as well as operational performance of SMEs in inventory intensive manufacturing industries. The key issue is whether Indian SMEs pursue better IM practices with an intension to reduce their inventory cost and enhance their competitiveness. If so, what are the IM practices pursued by these enterprises? What are the factors which influence the inventory cost and IM performance of enterprises?

In this situation only hundred percent exploitation of financial, human and technological potential of SMEs make certain the competitiveness and growth possibilities. Relatively little research has been conducted on performance management system in Pakistani SMEs. This study is more focused headed for investigating the PMS implementation and post implementation effects in small firms. Performance Management (PM) is a process for establishing a shared understanding about what needs to be achieved. It is an approach to managing people that increases the level of personal performance and business success. Any organization with suitable performance management system increase employer conviction that it has the right people in the right place at the right time. Performance management must consist of two basic components one is talent exploitation and preservation and second is performance feedback mechanism. In an organizational perspective one thing is quiet evident that maturity of employer- employee relationship depends upon employee job satisfaction and performance and conceptually job satisfaction and performance is directly proportional to each other. The dominant findings indicate that, SMEs in Pakistan are generally less likely to adopt 'formal' PMS practices, including setting goals, monitoring performance and performance evaluation practices. Similarly, they have not formulated 'formal' HR policy and human resource departments usually pursue traditional means of basic HR functions such as employee recruitment, training and compensation. However, from statistical results of textile sector small and medium enterprises exposed that employees do not have a clear understanding of what performance management system aim to achieve similarly big number of employees consider that performance appraisal is not aligned with organizational goals it has no functionality in employee career planning or progression. © 2010, INSInet Publication.||cited By 7|Department of Business Administration SALU, Khairpur, Pakistan|English|

Owing to the high rate of change in competitive dynamics within transformation economies, SMEs seek to develop new knowledge themselves or, more likely, transfer, adapt and implement new knowledge obtained from outside sources in order to increase their competitiveness. The effectiveness of identifying and transferring new knowledge and best practice depends to an extent on the level of absorptive capacity of the organisation, which, it can be argued, is strongly related to its inherent level of Human Resource Development (HRD). This paper reports the initial results of a research project which investigates the priorities for HRD in SMEs to enable managers to identify, transfer, assess and implement new knowledge gained through access to external sources. The study identifies significant differences between HRD priorities identified by management and the preferences of employees and potential employees in the form of undergraduate business students. The conclusions indicate that firms should consider the importance of both their own and employees' motivational factors in managing knowledge transfer mechanisms.

The role of HRM in large enterprises is relatively known, especially when the competitiveness and sustainable development are in question. On the other hand, small entrepreneurial and medium sized (SME) companies have not been greatly studied in relation to the HRM in the past. Although there is a lack of literature and empirical research in this area, several studies in the past decade and recent years emphasized the importance of the HRM for the survival and success of the SMEs. The reason why more and more authors today are arguing about the success of the SMEs is the perceived advantages of SMEs in a turbulent and unpredictable business environment. SMEs are seen as the driving force for vulnerable economies, a source of innovation, employment, and flexibility. Bearing in mind SMEs and their advantages, the authors have focused their attention on the economies in the Central and Eastern Europe countries (Slovenia, Serbia, Hungary and Bulgaria) where the SMEs are recognized as potential possibilities for economic recovery and development. Since human capital is recognized as one of the most important factors of enterprise success, the aim of this work was to explore the role of HRM in SMEs in the economies of Serbia, Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovenia, to determine the type of linkage between HRM and the success of small and medium-sized companies that operate in the CEE region, in light of the Cranet 2008/2010 survey data. The objective in this chapter was the exploration of the existence of organizations’ business strategy and HR strategy in SMEs, as well as HR departments, and the role of HRM in the business of the SMEs. The special task in this research was the exploration of the HRM activities and trends (recruitment, selection, compensation, performance management, training and development, human resource information system, etc.) that are present in the SMEs in the CEE region. The ranking of the SMEs’ performances is also presented and the relations between the existence of HRM and the several performance measures in these companies.

However, the work team, mostly made up of engineers, does not usually have experience in the use of design methodologies but also they are often familiar with the functioning of various design and quality-management tools. This paper presents a clear and simple design methodology that facilitates the development of adaptations to items of equipment that might be considered one-off products. It includes a selection of design tools that are, according to the literature on the subject, the most common and best- known among engineers, and which are also best- suited to the environment of an SME. The design methodology was validated experimentally with the upgrading of a gear-rolling tester installed on the premises of an SME in the sector. The recommended techniques and tools were satisfactory applied opening the possibilities for further application of the methodology in similar machine’s upgrades in the future. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.|Economics; Human resource management; Manufacture; Quality management, Design method; Manufacturing sector; one-off product; Quality management tools; Small and medium-sized enterprise; SMEs; Systematic designs; Techniques and tools, Product design|cited By 5|Centro Universitario de la Defensa, Academia General Militar, Zaragoza, Spain; Department of Design and Manufacturing Engineering, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain|English|

THe theoretical perspective was mainly oriented from the study made by Robbins and Judge (2009). In this sense, a research based on the quantitative paradigm was developed, with a non- experimental transectional design, for which a census formed by the 19 exporting SMEs of the sector was carried out. THe data was processed by the use of central tendency measures, evidencing that the indicators below the established average are the variety of work, the recognition of performance, safety, permanence, opportunities and relationship with the companions; on the contrary, the indicators referring to salary, structure and labor flexibility, reached the highest levels of satisfaction. It is concluded that the global effects in this sector require the definition of strategies made by Colombian companies, aimed at enhancing job satisfaction, considering human resource as the most important factor in competitiveness. © 2018, Universidad del Zulia.

One way to capture an enterprise's knowledge and make it available to all its members is through the use of knowledge management practices. This paper discusses the importance of knowledge management (KM) in Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and presents a framework to deal with knowledge management in order to enhance their competitiveness. Small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) are known for too much implicit knowledge, limited resources, insufficiently shared between managers and other employees. So, in the context of SMEs, KM can be used to capture knowledge and experience generated during their operations, activities, and processes. This research paper addresses a new way of thinking about the role of KM in SMEs through developing a framework that combines five phases of the KM lifecycle (capture, creation, codification, communication, and capitalization). This framework is called ""A Five C's Knowledge Management Framework"". The application of this framework will improve the success rate and competitiveness of SMEs."|Competition; Human resource management; Knowledge management, Implicit knowledge; Knowledge (K); Knowledge and experience; Knowledge management framework; Knowledge management practices; Organizational memory; Research papers; Small and medium-sized enterprise, Industry|cited By 5; Conference of 11th International Business Information Management Association Conference, IBIMA 2009 ; Conference Date: 4 January 2009 Through 6 January 2009; Conference Code:104414|Philadelphia University, Amman, Jordan|English|

The survival of many companies depends on their willingness and capacity to adapt to such changes. (Abdulaali, 2018) In this dynamic and complex economic system, the intangible assets of organizations become primary, being decisive for the organizations' performance. In the new economic competition, intangible assets provide a sustainable competitive advantage, intellectual capital and intangible assets representing the key factor in company profitability and success. In the knowledge based society, intellectual capital has more value for organizations than tangible assets and knowledge becomes a permanent source of competitiveness (Bhatti, Zaheer, 2014). It is considered by specialists a valuable and strategic resource, since the success of organizations depends on creating, discovering, storing, disseminating, measuring and developing knowledge. The main objective of the research presented in this paper is to offer an overview on the specific problems and needs of the entrepreneurs financed through the Romania Start-up Plus programme, part of Start-UP Hub: The Entrepreneurs Laboratory Cod SIMS: 105648. A primary target of this research is to examine the components of intellectual capital and the way in which the intellectual capital influences the small business performance. The majority of the researchers agree that intellectual capital is directly connected to the performance of the SMEs sector. The results of our analysis shows the fact that intangible assets influence business development in various ways, such as increasing competitive advantage, expanding employee competency and improving organizational performance. © 2021 Ramona Todericiu, published by Sciendo 2021.||cited By 4|Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu, Romania|English|

Design/methodology/approach: The research involves a sample of 157 managers responsible for HR in SMEs. SMEs are examined because in these firms, decisions are not usually adopted on a collegiate basis. It makes these firms an ideal context for studying the relationship between HR decision-maker’s EI and firm performance. Findings: Results show that the HR decision-maker’s EI determines firm performance in terms of generation of valuable HR and financial outcomes. They also confirm the mediating role of the system of HR practices in that relationship. Research limitations/implications: This research suggests that an adequate understanding of the importance of EI can guide efforts to boost SMEs competitiveness. Thus, as SMEs are an important part of the business fabric in the majority of developed economies, the implications of this study are significant. Originality/value: Findings in this research suggest that the workplace is not managed exclusively on a cognitive basis since emotional competences may play an important role in the HR management and SMEs’ performance. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.||cited By 4|Facultad de Economía, Empresa y Turismo, Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria – Campus de Tafira, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain|English|

For this reason, the perception of different human resource (HR) risks and establishing a suitable and effective HR risk management system is an up-to-date issue. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the most important sources of HR risks in the V4 countries and to find out the statistically significant differences in the perception of HR risk sources between the V4 countries. To collect the data in the years 2017 and 2018, an online questionnaire was used. To evaluate the intensity of the HR risk sources and to find out the differences between the V4 countries, the methods of Chi-square test and Z-score of P-value were used. The results showed that a high employee turnover rate, insufficient employee qualification, low work morale and discipline are perceived relatively most intensely in Hungary compared to other V4 countries, when “low work morale and discipline” is perceived most intensely out of all four HR risk sources studied. „Employee mistakes” are perceived statistically significantly more intensely in Poland compared to the Czech Republic and Slovakia. © 2020, Czestochowa University of Technology.

Successive governments in Nigeria continue to promote policies and agendas targeted to raise the competitiveness of the sector as part of the diversification of the economy and promote foreign direct investment (FDI). These efforts are yet to manifest in any significant reduction in importation of basic goods as well as double-digit unemployment rate. Several studies have focused on aspects of SME's performance with a sparse attention to the criticality of the impacts of conflict in the performance of the organisations leading to a wide gap in knowledge as to whether a conflict situation actually occurs in the SMEs, and if they do, how do they manifest? What are the impacts on performance and how effective are the administrative tools for managing them? This study attempts to bridge this gap. We adopt a survey method using a sample of 224 employees across a spectrum of industries located in Lagos, Ogun and Kwara States of the Federation of the Republic of Nigeria. While the prevalence of conflict was established in the study amongst the employees, compensation, reward and performance rating issues are most frequent sources of the conflict with behavioural manifestation including productivity scale down, battering the reputation and image of the employers as well as discouraging potential applicants. The study also found that most of the administrative tools to manage conflict are not considered very effective while a variation in the gender awareness to conflict was observed at the level of statistical significance. The study recommends conflict minimization strategies through a proper goal definition, conflict management skill upgrades with training, open communication, fair reward and compensation system. The risk of of the error occurrence is examined from the accountants' perspective. For this purpose, a questionnaire survey was used for data collection focusing on areas that are considered to be the most important by the accountants and the areas which are the most problematic. © 2018 Journal of Competitiveness.||cited By 4|Department of Employment Relations and Human Resource Management, Faculty of Business Administration, University of Lagos, Lagos, Akoka, Nigeria|English|

Subsequent to globalization, competitiveness has been established as the predominant factor in the markets. This has taken away all protection henceforth enjoyed by SMEs. Due to acute competition, SMEs are now facing a host of problems, including HR issues. A number of studies have examined various issues pertaining to SMEs. However, HR issues are yet to get the due focus. Though many studies have examined HR issues in SMEs, there exists substantial gap in literature in this area. The present study attempts to address this gap in literature. The study conducted in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India, collected data from a sample of 400 SME employees. Through Factor Analysis, the study has identified four factors that the employees perceive as problems faced by them. It is expected that the present work will trigger more works in the HR issues of SMEs. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

The second pillar of its successfulness is active participation of regional and local self- governments. In this article, we recommend to realise a growth-equalising strategy for the Slovak conditions after the SR accession. The growth- equalising strategy of regional policy should in our conditions: • Support and keep in growth the regional centres (developed agglomerations) that are decisive carriers of national-economy growth and create not only development resources in the Slovak economy but also a pro-growth environment for the equalisation of regions lagging behind; this part of the overall strategy is called growth-equalising strategy focusing on regional centres of national- economy growth (developed regions). These urban agglomerations are concerned: Bratislava - Trnava, Trenčín, Žilina - Martin, Poprad, Košice - Prešov and Banská Bystrica - Zvolen and the region of the city of Nitra. • Remove negative consequences of production decrement and adaptation to the new market conditions in the regions lagging behind, together with the support of localisation, revitalisation of the regions with deformed demographic and professional structure (the threat of social and economic degradation and marginalisation). This part of the overall strategy is called growth-equalising strategy focusing on regional centres in regions lagging behind. Urban centres must be the carriers of development also in such regions. In NUTS II. Western Slovakia the development of agglomeration Nové Zámky - Komárno is concerned, in the region of Central Slovakia - the development of the towns of Lučenec - Rimavská Sobota and in the East Slovakia region the development of the agglomeration Humenné - Vranov. • Both parts of the overall strategy should be implemented with a non-scattered concentrating model. The practice of regional development proved sufficiently that dispersing of funds, ""strewing"" an area with investments is a short term solution failing to provide long term changes of regional structures. In order to pursue effective use of national resources and, in particular, resources from the EU structural funds, the assumption that in the first after-accession stage (approximately 10 - 12 years) these funds will be absorbed by those cities and agglo-meration that dispose of decisive localisation advantages even today, is realistic. Preferring the growth-equalising strategy in its proposed concentrating form in the first stage after EU accession does not mean that the smaller regions out of the reach of the agglomeration development effects shall be excluded from the support. In terms of competitiveness changes till the year 2010, human resources, foreign direct investments, innovations, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and infrastructure, are analysed. According to model calculations the consequences of individual policies shall result until 2010, depending on the selected scenario, in changes in the competitiveness of the regions and GDP per capita development following the individual NUTS II and Slovak regions. Slovakia would approach 72.7 per cent of the EU 25 average forecast for 2010 (currently it is around 53 per cent). With the exception of the region of Bratislava (164.7 per cent) and partly the region of Trnava (74.3 per cent), Slovak regions would achieve values under 75 per cent of EU 25 GDP per capita. The knowledge gained by developed and also cohesion countries, however, shows that mostly the developed scope of regional institutions (including on the one hand institutions necessary for the functioning of the support mechanism and on the other hand institutions supporting transfer of technology and innovation, improving qualification, etc.) can, in particular, affect significantly the sustainability and triggering of regionnal growth. Particularly, the necessity to develop capacities needed for EU membership rises in the pre-accession period. This has resulted from the evaluation of the current situation of the Slovak public administration and ensuring the equalisation of the difference between this situation and the situation required from all EU Member States - existing as well as the new ones. With respect to Slovakia's interest to achieve EU membership in the year 2004 the building of effective and capable capacities for membership is a strategic priority."|economic growth; economic integration; European Union; regional economy, Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Slovakia|cited By 4|Ekon. univerzita v Bratislave, Narodohospodárska fakulta, Katedra reg. rozvoja geografie, Dolnozemská cesta 1, Bratislava 5 852 35, Slovakia|Slovak|

Since countries like Finland, Germany, Denmark and Sweden reach highest innovation performance among all EU countries, there are countries like Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, Poland or Slovakia which drag behind other European countries and rank among the countries with the weakest innovative performance. The aim of this paper is to identify the enablers of innovation in European SMEs by using the concept of intellectual capital. Through statistical analysis we have investigated how knowledge networks, which can be considered as the source of knowledge initiatives in SMEs, contribute to their innovation activities. According to conclusions of our analysis, creating knowledge network, which secure knowledge circulation and spilling over partners consisting of universities, state or local governments and SMEs, will increase knowledge base of the economy of a country, i.e. will grow the innovation activity of enterprises, improve the quality of human resources, research and technology, which are considered as key factors of European competitiveness.|Competition; Information dissemination; Information retrieval; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Personnel; Regression analysis, Clusters; Core competence; Innovation activity; Intellectual capital; Knowledge networks; Small and medium enterprise, Quality control|cited By 2; Conference of 5th International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Information Retrieval, KDIR 2013 and the 5th International Conference on Knowledge Management and Information Sharing, KMIS 2013 ; Conference Date: 19 September 2013 Through 22 September 2013; Conference Code:100807|Faculty of Management, Comenius University, Odbojárov 10, Bratislava, Slovakia|English|

By building on the literature of digital marketplace and business models we argue that the features of the context shape the type of the business models applicable for digital marketplaces. We suggest that before designing a digital marketplace initiative it is necessary to undertake a context assessment that ensures a better understanding of the firms' preparedness to the usage of this kind of platforms in terms of technological infrastructure, human resources' capabilities and skills, integration and innovation level among firms. It is essential to start with feasible initiatives and build up steadily the qualifications necessary for facing hindrances.

Digital Marketplaces represent one of the most powerful solutions adopted by firms to support the networking practices among firms, especially among SMEs. However in developing countries the potentialities of digital marketplaces remains largely unexploited. Different human, organizational and technological factors, issues and problems pertain in these countries, requiring focused studies and appropriate approaches. This article argues that in order for firms in developing countries to benefit from digital marketplace platforms it is necessary to root them in an assessment study which permits to understand the firms preparedness to use the digital marketplace in terms of technological infrastructure, human resources' capabilities and skills, integration and innovation level among firms. Based on the outcomes of this assessment it is then possible to find out a viable digital marketplace model that fits with actual readiness status of firms and helps them to develop progressively the necessary resources and capabilities to enhance their competitiveness in the current digital economic landscape.|Business models; Digital marketplace; Human resources; Networked economy; Sustainable Competitive Advantages; Technological factors; Technological infrastructure, Competition; Developing countries; Quality assurance, Electronic commerce|cited By 2; Conference of ICE-B 2009 - International Conference on e-Business ; Conference Date: 7 July 2009 Through 10 July 2009; Conference Code:79031|eBusiness Management Section, University of Salento, Lecce, Italy|English|

SMEs play an increasingly important role in all aspects of competitiveness: both products and production techniques, but also management methods, the organization of the firm and human resources training. One of the ways by which SMEs can achieve a competitive advantage in manufacturing is through the implementation of Advanced Manufacturing Technology (AMT). An increasing number of them have chosen and are choosing various levels of AMT as the solution. Realizing the importance of SMEs, an attempt has been made in this paper to review the application of AMT in SMEs. Also, a framework has been offered for the implementation of AMT in SMEs.

This research aims to examine the incidence of technology, human resources and management with innovation in these exporting companies. The research approach is quantitative, the method is deductive, the type of research is correlational, with a non-experimental and cross-sectional design, using a sample of 126 exporting companies from the province of Guayas- Ecuador. The data processing was through factorial analysis and subsequently a linear regression was performed. The results show that technology and management have a positive impact on the innovation of small and medium-sized exporting companies, where management is mainly oriented towards resources, skills and knowledge to achieve innovation. The research provides the literature with empirical evidence of these relationships since previous studies have focused on the export success of this type of company or on examining their innovation without focusing on the exporters.

This is a way to increase innovation and resource quality. On the other hand, the partnership strategy is an important factor in efforts to improve company performance. The involvement of the partnership strategy is one of the factors that strengthen the achievement of sustainable values. Furthermore, this affects the sustainability of a manufacturing company’s competitiveness, including Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). In this study, we focus on creating sustainable value and the role of partnership strategies in improving the business performance of SMEs engaged in the metal manufacturing industry. The Partial Least Squares (PLS) approach to Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is used to evaluate relationships and effects based on survey data from small and medium industries. The results show that the creation of sustainable value, including products, processes, production, equipment, organization, and human values, has a significant impact (β=0.522; ρ<0.001) on increasing the competitiveness of small and medium enterprises. The effect of sustainable value creation on sustainable competitiveness is fully moderated by the partnership strategy (β=0.179; ρ=0.03), especially in the technology & equipment, and human resources. Apart from being a moderating variable, the partnership strategy has also been shown to significantly act as a partial mediating variable (β=0.135; ρ<0.05) for sustainable value creation in enhancing competitiveness. The partnership strategy‘s simultaneous involvement proves that the partnership strategy plays an important role in value creation to increase the competitiveness of sustainable manufacturing SMEs.

The problem faced today is how to maintain the sustainability of SMEs if they have different backgrounds and knowledge that make them have to share knowledge to maintain the sustainability of SMEs. Product innovation, optimization of raw materials, customer needs, target markets, marketing methods, are examples of knowledge that are not all known by each of the internal actors of SMEs. By implementing a knowledge management framework based on four KM conceptual models by Stankosky and mapping the Cimosa business process, which is intended to explore the tacit and explicit knowledge of internal actors related to the sustainability of SMEs. Qualitative methods are used in this study and the data collection model is in the form of interviews. With the implementation of the framework, there are nine critical success factors identified in the craft industry, especially those operating in the Madura region. Determinants of success are Price, Promotion, Packaging, Product Innovation, Online Stores, Product Quality, Finance, Human Resources, Collaborative Sources. In a four- action framework analysis, there are no success determinants that are eliminated because no success determinants are eliminated at an early stage so there is no reduction in the development of SME business processes in the reduction phase. The critical success factor development is carried out on the nine main criteria in the craft industry and creates two additional critical success factors, namely unique and trademark. In mapping, Cimosa's business processes, the process management phase consists of improving vision and mission, improving objective strategies, improving SOPs, and improving, evaluating, and monitoring processes. Support processes include human resources and IT process, production, and financial process, while the Core Process includes research and development, marketing process, and logistic process. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.||cited By 1; Conference of 1st International Scientific Meeting on Engineering and its Vocational Education, ISMEVD 2019 ; Conference Date: 31 October 2019; Conference Code:162147|Politeknik Ati Makassar, Indonesia; Universitas Teuku Umar, Indonesia|English|

This work follows an explorative and descriptive methodology that uses analysis of secondary information as data collection instrument. Results suggest that SMEs in Chile seem to have a higher degree of adoption of CSR practices when compared to those of other countries in Latin America. Chilean SMEs tend to concentrate their efforts in the area of human resources; therefore, these organizations are more willing to invest in labor-related issues than in the negative impacts they may generate in the environment and society. This can be evaluated as a natural first stage, since worker-focused CSR programs generally have a faster return on investment than those focused on other areas. Also, the relations that SMEs develop with local communities to create value are still an area of opportunity that can be addressed through the SMEs and CSR technical groups of the Pacific Alliance. This alliance is an ideal platform to share best CSR practices among SMEs, which probably will increase their competitiveness. © 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited.||cited By 1|EGADE Business School Monterrey, Mexico|English|155-165

The factors include: Production and business characteristics; Competitiveness; Business strategy; CEO of awareness management; Human resource quality. The study is conducted on 238 SMEs in Hanoi and the results show that CEO’s awareness of management accounting had the strongest impact on the ability to apply management accounting of enterprises while competition level factor had the weakest effect. At the same time, the study also examines the significant role of mediating factor of firm size on the relationship between the characteristics of the production and business process and the application of management accounting, age and professional qualifications. The results indicate that enterprise size plays a significant role on regulating the impact of business characteristics of enterprises on management accounting application. For smaller enterprises, management accounting is less used and vice versa. Next, the younger the managers are, the higher the impact of their awareness on management accounting application, which means management accounting will be used more if managers are younger. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.||cited By 1|University of Economic and Technical Industries, Viet Nam; National Economics University, Viet Nam; State Treasury Tu SonBac Ninh, Viet Nam; East Asia University of Technology, Viet Nam|English|

In many of these companies, some of them having less than ten employees, management and operational functions are often carried out by the entrepreneur. In addition, the entrepreneur does not always have technical knowledge in management, nor do they have the available time (since they have various responsibilities within the company) to develop and implement a management strategy that allows the enterprise to remain in the market while adopting a more conscious, consistent and sustained orientation. Within the scope of the Operational Program for Competitiveness and Internationalization - Portugal 2020, the Balanced ScoreCard (BSC) strategic management instrument was developed and implemented in several companies and sectors of the Portuguese economy. This instrument was crucial in initiating a process of strategic thinking which, quite possibly, would not have happened in such a short time horizon. This research work analyses through an essentially qualitative research the way the BSC instrument was developed and implemented. Another objective is to understand the main advantages of its use and its main application constraints. The data was gathered through a semi- structured interview developed for the owners of four Portuguese SMEs in the northern region Portugal, targeted under the abovementioned programme framework. The results demonstrate the instrument was essential for the development of a structured strategic thinking, as well as for a better performance and, consequently, to the improvement of the competitiveness of the targeted companies. The results also show the instrument had to be adapted and simplified and its implementation has to involve all the employees of the enterprises. © 2018 Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE.

However, this is also leading to greater competition through an increase in the number of businesses. In Thailand, part of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) are significantly important to economic growth, employment rate, GDP and therefore their success has a critical impact on society. In this period of transition, Thai SMEs need the right supporting tools for their organisation to survive and grow. Globally, the adoption of Knowledge Management is becoming widespread with the potential to improve productivity and efficiency of various organisations. Successful Knowledge Management will benefit organisations through improving decision- making, quality of products/services whilst reducing the process lead-time and operational costs thus, contributing to market competitiveness. Despite, the large number of studies on Knowledge Management only few studies focus on SMEs. Furthermore, a systematic literature review conducted as part of this study highlights that whilst Knowledge Management research has been carried out in Thailand much of it is not accessible to non-Thai due to language. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify the current practice of Knowledge Management in Thai SMEs within the manufacturing sector and to examine how employees in the organization capture, share and store their knowledge as well as their perceptions about Knowledge Management. Survey questionnaires were distributed to SMEs in Manufacturing Sector in Thailand via online survey software (Qualtrics) and paper based version depending on participants' preference. The total respondents are 311 within 20 manufacturing SMEs across several business sectors. The paper focuses on two research questions which highlight the key differences that exist in knowledge management practices and perceptions in different sized SME's and between management and operational staffroles. In general, the results show the majority of employees in SMEs in Thailand consider Knowledge Management to be a beneficial tool with the potential to solve problems at work.

Portugal, like others European countries, is not set apart from the question of HRM. However, it is rare and recent to find empirical literature on practice of HRM in Portugal, and even more scarce to find literature that focuses on SMEs. This study clarifies the situation of SMEs in the Portuguese context, serving as a basis for discussion on HRM in SMEs in an international context. This chapter looks to understand the role of recruitment and selection on Human Resource Management (HRM) at Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Portugal, as well as contribute to a better knowledge of this area, still little studied. More particularly, it aims to understand the level of implementation of recruitment and selection. Data was collected by questionnaire from 512 small and medium enterprises in Portugal, and from these, 3 hypotheses were formulated and tested using the SPSS program. From this study, the authors conclude that HRM is not yet a reality in SMEs. Recruitment and selection are the HRM practices more commonly used in SMEs, but in an informal way. © 2014 by IGI Global.

IMS is a complex unit of interconnected requirements of two or more management system standards, which are incorporated into the overall corporate management system. Implementation of the integrated management system is more effective than separate implementation of management systems, such as: quality management system, environmental management system, safety and worker's health management system. With the advent of the international standard ISO 50001 - Energy Management System, which has a similar structure as ISO standards 9001, 14001 and 22000, the opportunity to integrate energy management system with other systems, has appeared. Interaction between man and machine, or the man-machine system (MMS) is an important component of production process. It is typical to consider MMS in terms of ergonomics or safety, although results of man-machine interaction may also affect the product's quality and environment. This article describes the role of MMS in an integrated management system in the small and medium-sized enterprises. © 2013 International Business Information Management Association.|Economics; Energy management systems; Environmental management systems; Ergonomics; Image quality; Information management; Integrated control; Interactive computer systems; Machinery; Man machine systems; Quality management; Sustainable development, Health management systems; Integrated management; Integrated management systems; International standards; Man-machine interaction; Production efficiency; Quality management systems; Small and medium-sized enterprise, Human resource management|cited By 1; Conference of 21st International Business Information Management Association Conference, IBIMA 2013 ; Conference Date: 27 June 2013 Through 28 June 2013; Conference Code:106714|Vienna University of Technology, Austria|English|

Currently, most research on innovation has not explored its relationship with the innovative thinking of leaders; the literature is unclear as to what innovative companies do differently to achieve superior performance. This study advances in the investigation of how the mentality of leaders influences innovation processes, for this purpose the difficulties faced by SMEs in the industrial sector in Colombia were analyzed, finding that at the country level it is not clear that there is a culture of innovative thinking in their leaders. The research was carried out under the descriptive approach, supported by qualitative and quantitative studies of a sample of Colombian SMEs. The research is associated with the analysis of data on competitiveness, innovation, and technological development in SMEs; in Colombia, the highest concentration of researchers is in the education sector with 95.7% and only 2.5% is in companies, 1.7% is outside the country. In terms of limitations, we found no evidence from studies that promote innovative thinking techniques. The practical implications of this research are to demonstrate the importance for SMEs of strengthening research in their managers and teams to generate innovation; the originality or value of this document is in promoting a model for the development of innovative thinking in leaders. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

This research investigated the use of SHRM in Thai high technology firms. It used a mixed methods approach to examine the effect of strategic HRM practices including recruitment and selection, training and development, performance appraisal, compensation systems, and flexible work practices on firm outcomes of product quality, corporate reputation and innovation. It was a quantitative-led approach, incorporating HR interviews and a survey. The quantitative findings were used to evaluate the hypotheses, while the quantitative findings were used to evaluate barriers to SHRM implementation in medium and small firms. Analysis of the quantitative survey of high-tech firms (n = 312) showed that SHRM practices had significant effects on product quality (except for flexible work), reputation (except for recruitment and hiring) and innovation (except for recruitment and hiring and training and development). The strongest effect was on company reputation. ANOVA showed that large and medium firms were significantly more likely to use SHRM than small firms. Qualitative interviews with small firms (n = 10) identified several barriers to SHRM implementation, including lack of time, cost, and expertise as well as preference for traditional hiring practices. The implication of this study is that SHRM does have a benefit to technology firms in Thailand, but that small firms may not be recognizing this benefit. The major policy implication is that the Thai government needs to address knowledge and resource barriers for SMEs in the high-tech industry to enable them to use SHRM effectively. © 2021 Sriwijaya University.

Considering its domination over 98% of total established businesses, SME sector become essential to drive the government's agenda. Apart from human resource, financing, innovativeness, and legal environment, availability of timely and relevant information in support of business's decision making is highly crucial for ensuring its competitiveness. Accessibility to the relevant information helps firms to lower their operating cost, to effectively manage available resources and ultimately to improve overall productivity. Information Technology/Information Systems (IT/IS) has been recognized as one of the potential means to supply information for timely business decision making. Despite growing importance of IT/IS for firm's competitiveness, SMEs embrace constant challenges to deploy IT/IS effectively and thus hardly to optimize its strategic values. Consequently, IS planning is getting paramount to promote effective management of IT/IS within SME sector. Thus, this study proposes a study that investigates the current state of IS planning practices and the factors affecting the IS Planning success among Malaysian SMEs. Adapting IS planning framework of large organizations, this study proposes IS planning framework that is applicable for SMEs environment. The developed framework could facilitate SMEs to effectively manage IS planning as to ensure greater strategic benefits of IT/IS deployment. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.|Decision making; Green computing; Information management; Sustainable development, Business decisions; Business sector; Economic growths; Economic transformation; Effective management; Large organizations; Strategic benefits; Strategic values, Competition|cited By 0; Conference of 1st International Conference on Green and Sustainable Computing, ICoGeS 2017 ; Conference Date: 25 November 2017 Through 27 November 2017; Conference Code:137760|Tunku Puteri Intan Safinaz School of Accountancy, Universiti Utara Malaysia, Sintok, Kedah, 06010, Malaysia|English|

The issues of learning organizations are wide and multidimensional. Generally, learning organizations focus on “learning” as a crucial component in their visions, goals, values, and all of their functions. There is an opinion that by collective learning, the organization’s members are able to improve the organizations performance and competitive advantages. It is especially important for SMEs, which should be under special attention because of their special influence on economic growth, unemployment reduction, market competitiveness, etc. For learning organization the priority is that the individual learning process needs to have a voluntary rather than compulsory character. The biggest challenge for managers/owners is increasing the willingness to learn and then share new knowledge with other members of the organization. Additionally, members of the learning organization should not only accept orders from their superiors, but they need to have courage and be encouraged to question established norms to explore new avenues of thinking and to make mistakes in order to improve their products/services and production methods. From this perspective, the crucial role for building learning processes in organization is the specifically shaped relationship between superiors and employees and effective human resource management. The main aim of this paper is to identify and analyze the relations supporting and limiting organizational learning. The empirical part of the paper was prepared on the basis of questionnaire survey in 2016 on a group of 250 micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises in Poland. During the elaboration of the paper, the generally accepted methods of economic research were used, including statistical analysis (gamma correlation coefficient) and graphical illustration methods. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.||cited By 0; Conference of 8th International Conference on the Economies of the Balkan and Eastern European Countries in the Changing World, EBEEC 2016 ; Conference Date: 6 May 2016 Through 8 May 2016; Conference Code:273199|Czestochowa University of Technology, Częstochowa, Poland|English|

The legality aspect that concerns business interests needs to be a new paradigm. The role of the state is to provide an effective regulatory framework along with monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. The government should take into consideration the fact that the support of legality aspect is needed for the SMEs where the workers are low income or are in it, while the capacity of UMKM is limited, both in terms of revenue and technology used. Data in this research will be obtained by field observation, interview and questionnaire. Resource persons and respondents in this study include the parties involved in the making of regulations and management of SMEs. The results of the research are presented in narrative form in various ways such as a deep reflection description about the regulation and policy of UMKM by the government in realizing people's prosperity The results of this study indicate that the perpetrators of UMKM have an awareness about the aspect of business legality although it is felt to increase the burden of SMEs.The perpetrators of SMEs are willing to take care of the legality of the business in the hope of obtaining legal certainty in the effort and get the facilitation and coaching from the government so as to encourage the growth of UMKM. The model of MSME development through the legality aspect of the future business needs to consider the ability to pay (ability to pay) and the principle of benefit (benefit principle). The perpetrators of MSMEs as one of the economic development actors in the regions need to be empowered through the development of human resources, capital support, production and productivity, business protection, partnership development, business and marketing network and business legality. © 2017 Serials Publications Pvt.

Moreover, for Khandwalla (1977), the environment is also the source of constraints, unforeseen problems and opportunities. In this sense, Lenz (1978: 32) argues that the environment can be defined as a “source of trends and events that create opportunities and threats for enterprises.” In fact, the environment is a multidimensional concept consisting of market factors, government regulations, technology, innovation and availability of scarce and critical resources. However, on the opportunities for the environment, Mavondo (1999) concludes that the attractiveness of the business environment determines the effective organizational strategies, increases the importance of market direction and increases the importance of human resource management. Moreover, it leads to greater investment to reduce manufacturing costs and is related positively to financial performance. Furthermore, in emerging and developing countries, specifically countries in transition to the market economy, White and Linden (2002) report that market liberalization – policy-induced opening of the global environment – requires a wide range of changes in businesses formerly protected and often regulated. This new environment is generally characterized by a dramatic change in the basis of competition and business viability. It affects most economic activities. To address the problem of environmental disadvantages in emerging and developing countries, governments have developed programs to “upgrade” businesses. The purposes of these programs are to improve firms’ performance and competitiveness both nationally and internationally. These objectives require the adaptation of the immediate environment to the enterprise, but also action within the enterprise itself (Bouzidi, 2010). Indeed, the role of governments to upgrade the sector of small business in emerging and developing countries is substantial. This role is in providing an economic legal and regulatory climate, and policies suitable for the development of small business. This vital sector mainly contributes to the promotion of the economic framework, promotes job security, well-being of the population as a whole and social and political stability (Julien, 1994; Mawardi et al., 2011) Governments in these countries have expended phenomenal human and material resources. For example, Malaysia has spent $8 billion to upgrade some 287,000 SMEs. Currently, Algeria has committed $5 billion to upgrade 20,000 small-and medium-sized businesses in its five-year economic program for 2010-2014 (Habaradas, 2008; Mebtoul, 2010). In fact, from this perspective, Bennaceur et al. (2007) define the upgrade by the adaptation of structures, resources and management processes of small business to improve their performance and enhance their ability to compete in national and international markets. Similarly, for experts of the United Nations Organization for Industrial Development (UNIDO), the objective of upgrading or adapting businesses is twofold: “Action to improve business performance in terms of production and growth and also improving competitiveness to enable it to fight effectively in its new competitive field and to grow” (quoted in Madoui and Boukrif, 2009: 5). In this chapter we discuss three concepts: The upgrade, the adaptation and the performance of small business. Therefore, the objective of this work is to determine whether the upgrade has an effect on adaptation and performance of small businesses in emerging and developing countries. To answer this research question, we begin with an overview of the concepts of upgrading and adaptation. From this perspective, we attempt to integrate the conceptual models discussed in an integrative framework that allow us to understand this phenomenon theoretically. We now proceed to discuss the link between adaptation and performance in a changing environment. We focus in particular on the situation of small business. We shall rely mainly on the work of entrepreneurship scholars. We shall also address the adaptation experiences of small business in the world, mainly in emerging and developing countries, emerging markets of Southeast Asia and countries in transition in Eastern Europe, ending with North African experiences. This section concludes with a synthesis and integration recounting the highlights and key successes of upgrading, adaptation and performance of the cases studied. Thus, we conclude this work by discussing the integrative concepts studied. We end with a short conclusion. In this introduction we present a brief description of contingency theory, which explains an adaptive behavior of an organization in its contextual environment. Contingency theory takes into account both the organization and its environment and assumes that entrepreneurs are rational and responsible for changing the characteristics of the enterprise to adapt to the level of uncertainty in the environment. Entrepreneurs are assumed to be rational and they can buy or deploy the necessary resources to ensure business performance. In this theory, entrepreneurs have some level of discretion (Burns and Stalker, 1961; Woodward, 1965; Thompson, 1967; Lawrence and Lorsh, 1969). © 2014 selection and editorial material, Elie Virgile Chrysostome and Rick Molz; individual chapters, the contributors.||cited By 0|University of Québec, Montreal, Canada; International Strategic Management, HEC Montreal, Canada|English|339-369

However in developing countries the potentialities of digital marketplaces remains largely unexploited. Different human, organizational and technological factors, issues and problems pertain in these countries, requiring focused studies and appropriate approaches. This article argues that in order for firms in developing countries to benefit from digital marketplace platforms it is necessary to root them in an assessment study which permits to understand the firms preparedness to use the digital marketplace in terms of technological infrastructure, human resources' capabilities and skills, integration and innovation level among firms. Based on the outcomes of this assessment it is then possible to find out a viable digital marketplace model that fits with actual readiness status of firms and helps them to develop progressively the necessary resources and capabilities to enhance their competitiveness in the current digital economic landscape.|Business models; Digital marketplace; Human resources; Networked economy; Sustainable Competitive Advantages; Technological factors; Technological infrastructure, Competition; Developing countries; Quality assurance, Electronic commerce|cited By 0; Conference of ICETE 2009 - International Joint Conference on e-Business and Telecommunications ; Conference Date: 7 July 2009 Through 10 July 2009; Conference Code:79143|Ebusiness Management Section, University of Salento, Lecce, Italy|English|

Due to its fragile past, Kosovo has suffered greatly from both economic and human resources underdevelopment. In the late 1990s, the European Union (EU) began to promote trade liberalization in order to bring about regional reconciliation in the Western Balkan region. SMEs in Kosovo need to develop their competitiveness in order to increase their exports. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of human resource characteristics such as the number of employees, education level, and attendance of training related to exports on the level of exports of 100 Kosovo SMEs. The Probit model is used to derive statistical results. Statistical analysis is conducted based on descriptive statistics, Reliability Test - Cronbach's Alpha-, Pseudo R2, LR chi2, the Prob>chi2 and Wald test. It can be concluded that this research will be of interest for the field of Human Resources Management as well as the scientific community in developing countries such as Kosovo. The main conclusion of the paper is that human resources of Kosovo exporting SMEs do not have the necessary expertise and contemporary knowledge regarding international trade.|Human resources; Kosovo; SMEs; export growth; Probit model||Jusufi, G (Corresponding Author), Univ Prishtina, Fac Econ, St Agim Ramadani 10000, Prishtina, Kosovo.

The authors explored the relationship between firm competitiveness and firm characteristics such as size, age, industry affiliation and location. Design/methodology/approach The complex competitiveness index as a proxy for firm competitiveness was calculated from the survey data. In total, 132 complete questionnaires filled in by representatives of randomly selected Czech SMEs were collected in 2018. Additional firm characteristics (size, age, industry affiliation and location) considered as determinants of competitiveness were obtained from the commercial database Albertina and from the Czech Statistical Office. The determinants of competitiveness were tested econometrically by estimation of multivariate regression models. Findings The authors mainly found a significant relationship between the firm size and competitiveness of the Czech SMEs. The authors have also confirmed that the least competitive enterprises are those operating in the agricultural sector and that regional location plays an important role in the determination of firm competitiveness. Practical implications The identification of competitiveness drivers can provide entrepreneurs, managers and policymakers with important implications. It seems beneficial for the Czech SMEs to expand the scope of operations to achieve a larger company size, for example, by focussing on investment activities, direct marketing, improving entrepreneurial skills or by applying an aggressive sales strategy, especially towards markets with lower competition. Politicians may respond to these efforts by setting the appropriate policies that promote SMEs' competitiveness, for example, through the hard and soft public support for financial and human resources. Originality/value Although many studies on competitiveness have been published, there is still a limited number of firm-level studies looking at competitiveness from multiple angles rather than from the study of profitability and productivity. In contrast, the study uses a complex firm-level competitiveness index based on ten competitiveness pillars (technology, human capital, products, domestic market, networks, international markets, online presence, marketing, decision making and strategy) to capture the contribution of different resources and capabilities to firm competitiveness.|Competitiveness; Competitiveness index; Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); Firm size; Firm- level analysis; Czech Republic||Dvoulety, O (Corresponding Author), Univ Econ, Dept Entrepreneurship, Prague, Czech Republic.

Indeed, national and international governments call for urgent transformations into sustainable development, where firms are affected and affecting this situation. However, recent evidence has shown that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) present low interest, commitment and maturation levels on sustainability; they seem to neglect and question the actual impact of transforming sustainability as a priority in their operations. Thus, this paper aims to measure the impact of sustainability on competitiveness in SMEs. Design/methodology/approach This is empirical research on sustainability and competitiveness in SMEs with a quantitative approach through structural equation modeling. Three hundred twenty-five surveys were applied to SMEs' manufacturing, construction, trade and services, operating in Mexico. Before measuring variables' multiple correlations, tests were carried out to establish the validity and reliability of the model. The data collection, validation and analysis were carried out with statistical package for social sciences and analysis of moment structures. Findings The results indicate a significant positive effect of SMEs' sustainability on competitiveness. The adjusted measurement model shows validity and reliability through the various tests applied. Thus, firms should not view sustainability as detrimental to their competitiveness. Originality/value Because firms are crucial in the urgent sustainability transformation, recent research has shown their low commitment and maturation to sustainability. This research's originality empirically measures and demonstrates sustainability's impact on SMEs' competitiveness. Therefore, empirically testing this impact becomes essential and original to provide better insights into SMEs' needs to be uncovered, prioritied and done in their specific and evolving contexts.|Competitiveness; Sustainability; Structural equations; Small to medium-sized enterprises (SME)||Lopez-Torres, GC (Corresponding Author), Univ Autonoma Aguascalientes, Dept Human Resources, Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes, Mexico.

Coming out of the great financial crisis, initiatives to nurture their (export) competitiveness have been high on the political agenda. In this vein, a growing literature explores the pertinence of firm-specific factors for explaining differences in SMEs' export behavior. However, the puzzle of how intangible, knowledge- based assets, such as human and relational capital, contribute to establishing a viable position in export markets remains. By synthesizing empirical evidence from 167 studies, this meta-analytic path analysis reveals significant differential direct and indirect effects of human and relational capital endowment on dimensions of export behavior. Concurrently, our analysis uncovered that positive influences of intangible assets are context- dependent.

Although showing signs of advance, most of the existing literature still relies, to a great extent, on case studies and conceptual frameworks, with little empirical research in the specific context of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This paper adds to the literature by empirically assessing the effects of organizational antecedents and innovation climate on OI as well as its consequences on firm performance in SMEs. In addition, the moderating roles of environmental dynamisms and competitiveness in the relationships between innovation climate and inbound and outbound OI are analyzed. To achieve these goals, this paper develops an integrative research model, which analyses the network relations using covariance-based structural equation modeling (SEM) on a data set of 429 Spanish SMEs. Results revealed that organizational factors such as commitment-based human resources practices have a positive influence on innovation climate and that innovation climate contributes to both inbound and outbound OI. Another important finding is that contingent factors such as environmental dynamism strengthen the positive effect of innovation climate on outbound OI. The main conclusions of this research can be valuable to SMEs that implement or intend to implement OI.

However, although they represent a very important factor in today's business these businesses face a number of challenges as they are constantly under pressure to maintain their own competitiveness both in the domestic and global markets. One of the key sources of survival of small and medium enterprises and building a sustainable competitive advantage are considered innovations. They usually start with innovative ideas and innovative activities that lead to improvement in the overall performance of the company. In addition to improving product quality and reducing costs, innovation also allows for increased efficiency and sales for the organization. Innovation is a process that must take place continuously. The implementation of innovative culture in companies must include all segments of the company and help to create good conditions for the development of creative individuals. Croatia is a country that belongs to the group of moderate innovators, however, as innovation is today a key factor in the success of all companies, this paper investigates the influence of human resources and leadership on innovation in small and medium-sized companies in Croatia.|human resources; leadership; innovation; small and medium enterprises||Ivanovic, S (Corresponding Author), Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management Opatija, Rijeka, Croatia.

Based on the mentioned research problem, we formulated the aim of paper: To detect the significant interrelations among the assessment of global competitiveness, business environment as well as human development in the EU (28) countries for the period of 2006-2017. To address these problems, the methodology of global multi-criteria indices, namely the global competitiveness index (GCI), doing business index (DBI), and human development index (HDI), as well as panel analysis and non-linear regression analyses with ANOVA, were applied. The panel analysis results suggest that there is a direct linear relationship between the GCI and HDI. Moreover, the impact of the DBI on the change in the GCI score was not confirmed. We identified the main areas of countries' interest, and important economic and statistical significant relations of competitiveness by creating three models: The GD model (constructed by GCI and DBI scores), GH model (GCI and HDI scores), and GDH model (GCI, DBI and HDI scores). Based on the results, all interrelations were confirmed. However, the highest extent of variability for the explanation of the selected data was recorded in the case of the GDH model (87.12%). We detected the impact of the business environment and human resources as competitive advantages on global macroeconomic competitiveness. As the business sector in EU (28) countries is represented mainly by small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs), enterprise activities play a key role in the process of sustainable competitive economic development. Moreover, human resources are considered to be another important driver of the internationalization of European SMEs.|multi-criteria indices; global competitiveness; business environment; human development; regression modelling; small and medium enterprises||Sofrankova, B (Corresponding Author), Univ Presov Presov, Dept Finance, Fac Management, Konstantinova 16, Presov 08001, Slovakia.

The survival of many companies depends on their willingness and capacity to adapt to such changes. (Abdulaali, 2018) In this dynamic and complex economic system, the intangible assets of organizations become primary, being decisive for the organizations' performance. In the new economic competition, intangible assets provide a sustainable competitive advantage, intellectual capital and intangible assets representing the key factor in company profitability and success. In the knowledge based society, intellectual capital has more value for organizations than tangible assets and knowledge becomes a permanent source of competitiveness (Bhatti, Zaheer, 2014). It is considered by specialists a valuable and strategic resource, since the success of organizations depends on creating, discovering, storing, disseminating, measuring and developing knowledge. The main objective of the research presented in this paper is to offer an overview on the specific problems and needs of the entrepreneurs financed through the Romania Start-up Plus programme, part of Start-UP Hub: The Entrepreneurs Laboratory Cod SIMS: 105648. A primary target of this research is to examine the components of intellectual capital and the way in which the intellectual capital influences the small business performance. The majority of the researchers agree that intellectual capital is directly connected to the performance of the SMEs sector. The results of our analysis shows the fact that intangible assets influence business development in various ways, such as increasing competitive advantage, expanding employee competency and improving organizational performance.|intellectual capital; intangible asset; SMEs performance; structural capital; relational capital||Todericiu, R (Corresponding Author), Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania.

The global Covid-19 pandemic even strengthens this trend. The degree of digitalization of corporate processes becomes the SME stability and development limitation. The paper submitted presents the results of research focused on the issue of digital transformation of business models on a test sample of 496 SMEs (out of which 214 operate in the manufacturing sector and industry and 218 are included in the services sector) using the method of dimensionality reduction and logit regression. The main output from the solution valid for both tested sectors is considered insufficient setting, management and evaluation of corporate processes. This applies to the main value-creating processes (input and output logistics, production, marketing and sales, service and other ancillary services) and supporting processes (purchase, scientific and technological development, human resources management and company infrastructure). In terms of the achieved degree of process digitization, an imbalance was found between the main value-creating processes and supporting processes. Investment in value-creating and supporting corporate processes are not considered an important factor for any of the sectors due to the high sensitivity of investments to the size and specialization of companies. In contrast, the higher perceived need for value chain digitization in both tested sectors, especially in the case of manufacturing and industry, is considered a very positive output. This proves the need for the digital transformation of companies and its positive impact on their profitability and competitiveness.|business model; corporate strategy; value chain; digitalization||Strakova, J (Corresponding Author), Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Fac Coporate Strategy, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.

CSR assumes a large range of activities focused on one or multiple targets, from work conditions to social programs, or environmental impact. The influence of CSR strategies on market performance depend on how truthful consumers will understand and believe to be the values offered by companies. The qualitative research has considered seven case studies from Portuguese textiles and fashion companies. We have found that a major obstacle to SMEs was the cost of CSR programs and their internal and external communication. As a rule, SMEs have small financial investment capabilities and their human resources tend to be scarce and not available to engage more responsibilities. Moreover, managers argue they compete in the market with companies that have low production as well as low social and environmental costs. If CSR strategies establish a set of clear and transparent practices, consumers will be able to compare across world suppliers, will result in additional costs and clients are not willing to pay for. The development of an accreditation system, able to clearly establish the reality of CSR practices within companies, is an important contribution to the implementation of CSR strategies into the textile and clothing sectors. The researchers have developed a system that can be managed step-by-step, and implemented progressively as companies receive and evaluate market feedback. The system introduces a clear communication about the company's actions and commitment to CSR, resulting in an unique label, capable of stating to whom it may concern, the company' present situation and its development year after year.|Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR); ethical corporate management; SMEs; sustainable development; textile and fashion||Guedes, G (Corresponding Author), Univ Minho, Engn Sch, Campus Azurem, P-4800058 Guimaraes, Portugal.

Furthermore, three important sub-variables of LOAs (i.e., creating continuous learning opportunities, establishing systems to capture and share learning and providing strategic leadership for learning) have a positive and significant effect on learning transfer. Finally, transferring LOAs was found to mediate the relationship between LOAs and innovativeness by creating continuous learning opportunities (and future directions) and by providing strategic leadership for learning.|||Yoon, J (Corresponding Author), POSTECH, Lab 327, Sci Bldg, Bldg 4,77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang, South Korea.

As well, to propose a model suited to the characteristics of the small business. The information is collected from 22 Basque Country SMEs grouped into industrial clusters, through a survey that is conducted to identify the use of practices related to knowledge management. Results show that informal practices figure prominently in the day to day of the SME and that the knowledge management process is not standardized but that is performed by the collaborative work between people, among others. Besides, the size of the SME acts as a factor in regard to the level of formality in knowledge management process. This study helps SME managers understand where the organizational knowledge is found within organizations and, consequently, to not neglect the importance of people in keeping competitiveness high. The article provides new information on how firms located in a particular region of Spain perform in relation to knowledge management, and it could be considered a sort of benchmarking practice on the behavior of SME in managing knowledge, which will be useful for the organization when taking management decisions.

Managers in power, involved in the construction project life cycle, create rules for the game and are the main players. The project's success can be perceived differently by stakeholders. A company's competitiveness, successful implementation of the projects and effective safety management depends on the strategic allocation of its human resources in order to select a proper project team in alignment with employee capabilities. This requires detailed factors reflecting their role (in line with their interests and attitudes) and knowing which of them has a decisive influence on the successful implementation of the project. The real data describing key factors in this concept can be provided as uncertain conditions. This work presents a novel integrated modified fuzzy group decision- making approach to select and rank the most influential persons ensuring the sustainable prevention of accidents at work in the small and medium-sized construction enterprises. This model includes the Delphi method and fuzzy extensions of Eckenrode's criteria rating method. The proposed model could be expanded in order to select the most suitable individuals for sustainable management of safety and, moreover, for the effective implementation of safety and health measures.|construction site; accidents prevention; occupational safety; risk management; fuzzy; rating; group; MCDM||Stankiuviene, A (Corresponding Author), Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.

We consider GVC firms are those engaging in any of the three modes including (i) using domestic inputs to export (D2E), (ii) using imported inputs to produce for the domestic market (I2P), (iii) using imported inputs to export (I2E). We discover that FDI-SME linkages statistically encourage Vietnamese SMEs to integrate into the GVC via I2P and I2E, while no statistical association between FDI-SME linkage and D2E participation is found. GVCs participation likelihood is also positively correlated with the introduction of new product introduction. The establishment of firms' production facilities in industrial zones and foreign ownership are both reported to be significantly decisive factors to SMEs' decisions on GVC participation. Besides, there is a strong association between firms' attributes, i.e. employment, capital intensity as well as financial access, and their participation in the GVC. Local governance quality (proxied by the Provincial Competitiveness Index) and the share of skilled labor at the province-level can facilitate firms' integration into GVCs, while greater market concentration may be a hurdle to such potential.|Global Value Chain; FDI-SME Linkage; Manufacturing; Vietnam||Nguyen, TMT (Corresponding Author), Foreign Trade Univ, Fac Int Econ, 91 Chua Lang St, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam.

So, the main objective of this paper is to analyze the possibilities of EPDs implementation in Mexico's housing sector from the business sector (a bottom-up approach), determining the possible challenges this approach would have. Methods The experience, vision, and perspective about EPDs from the main potential users of this ecolabel in Mexico have been considered. For this, a questionnaire to housing developers and Mexican companies implementing EPDs has been applied. Similar studies from developed countries have been used as a reference to establish a possible path for the EPD development in a business sector of a country like Mexico. Based on this analysis, an outlook and challenges for a bottom-up EPD implementation in Mexico's housing sector has been made. Results and discussion Reduce the environmental impact and increase the commercial competitiveness are two of the main reasons for companies to implement sustainability strategies. Although EPDs serve these objectives, and there are Mexican standards, normative instruments, and housing design guides recommending the use of this ecolabel, there are few housing developers knowing EPDs, and there are also few Mexican companies implementing this ecolabel. Moreover, there is limited knowledge about EPDs in Mexico, both by final consumers and professional buyers. On the other hand, the European benchmark has served to detect common aspects about the EPD implementation, as well as to establish a possible development path that can be used to accelerate its implementation by Mexican companies. Conclusions In Mexico, there is a solid legislative and regulatory framework that can be used as a starting point to promote the EPDs in housing sector. There is also a widespread interest from companies in using ecolabels as part of its sustainability strategies. However, there is still not enough supply-demand for this kind of information, nor the technical and personnel capacity supporting the EPD implementation. Consolidate the human resources formation in life cycle assessment (LCA), inform about the EPD's usefulness, and facilitate the understanding of such information to consumers and professional buyers would be the main challenges to promote this ecolabel in Mexico.|Building environmental assessment; Emerging economy countries; EPD; Housing sector; LCA; Mexico; SMEs||Arvizu-Pina, VA (Corresponding Author), Univ Iberoamer Ciudad Mexico, Dept Arquitectura Urbanismo & Ingn Civil, Prolongac Paseo Reforma 880, Mexico City 01219, DF, Mexico.

Due to its dynamic structure, it is a much wider term than that of logistics management, because it encompasses the process of conceiving, developing, optimizing and managing internal and external components of acquisition, transformation of material and distribution of finished products or services in accordance with the business strategic goals. The aim of the supply chain management is the creation of as great a value as possible for all value chain participants, especially for the final consumer, as he is at the end of the system of value creation and he validates the quality of supply chain via his purchase. When all enterprises- participants in the supply chain - do their business separately and act on their own separate business strategies, the sum of their expenses surpasses the expenses generated by integrated business of these enterprises within the supply chain. It is precisely because of this fact that, when an enterprise creates a unique system of goods and information flow with other members of the chain, it in fact enhances the efficiency of managing the entire chain. In that way, the value of the whole system increases for the consumer and competitive advantage of the chain is created. Since the clusters occur by connecting enterprises or chains of new value creation, the rest of this paper explains the meeting points between cluster concept and supply chain concept respectively, with special emphasis on agricultural clusters. The basic idea was that agricultural clusters are a geographical concentration of mutually connected SMEs, specialized suppliers and service providers, companies in related businesses, scientific and educational institutions, and government bodies and agencies in the sectors of agriculture and rural development. Therefore, the network of interdependent enterprises (individual agricultural farmsteads), within agricultural clusters and related institutions, confirms that within every cluster there are numerous supply chains, that is, that the supply chain management is an integral part and an indispensable factor of a cluster. At the same time, there is a complementarity and symbiosis between the concept of supply chain management and cluster concept, that is, their combination can effectively advance the competitive advantage both of the enterprises (individual agricultural farmsteads) and consequently regional and national economic competitiveness. The geographical proximity of cluster participants enables a more efficient access to specialized resources, information, human resources, institutions, and trainings; facilitates the coordination of activities within enterprises (individual agricultural farmsteads) as well as among cluster members; creates larger possibilities for innovation; stimulates permanent comparison of performances and of creating more successful business models, so-called best practices; and contributes to the commercialization of products and services and entering the new markets, as well as creating of new enterprises (individual agricultural farmsteads). More specifically, doing business in a cluster environment stimulates the competitiveness of enterprises (individual agricultural farmsteads) and affects the promotion of supply chain management within enterprises (individual agricultural farmsteads).|supply chain; value chain; logistic management; supply chain management; clusters||Mitrovic, V (Corresponding Author), Fac Org Sci Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.

In Slovakia, despite the dominance of family businesses, not enough attention is paid to them. The main objective of the paper is to identify the key internal determinants that affect the management, sustainability and development of Slovak family businesses. Current information on the researched issue has been obtained through empirical research in practice. The research was evaluated using statistical hypothesis testing methods (Binomial test and Mann-Whitney U test). While verifying the hypotheses, the statistical software STATISTICA 12, was used. The results of the study led to conclusions that extend the current knowledge in family businesses in Slovakia. The achieved results showed that the key internal determinants influencing the development of family businesses in Slovakia are: management, human resources, finances and narrow specialization of the supply, especially on the Slovak market.|family business; internal determinants; business environment; management; nepotism||Sedliacikova, M (Corresponding Author), Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Wood Sci & Technol, Zvolen, Slovakia.

For the purpose of this study, literature review has been conducted with particular focus on high-quality journals with a proven influence in the HRM and Innovation field. Concerning the research strategy, 23 papers published in Q1 and Q2 ranked journals (SJR) were analyzed, as well as 6 other sources inlcuding books, books proceedings and journals (not ranked in Scopus or WoS databases). Our findings support the development of an integrated approach that not only takes into account early investment into HR systems, but also considers how macroeconomic factors might influence the industry directly, and start-ups indirectly and incongruously. This integrated perspective maintains that human capital acquisition and the implementation of adequate HR policies and practices that support employee engagement and retention early on are significantly more beneficial to company performance and productivity in the longer run; whereas, at the same time exhibiting a high degree of flexibility and adaptability to business-and sector-specific preconditions and requirements. We argue that future research should concentrate on the industry as a factor determining the HR strategy to be adopted by start-ups, as opposed to debating which approach is more appropriate for start-ups without taking into account their operational environment.|Start-up; Human Resource Systems; Innovation; Business Development; High-Performance||cera, E (Corresponding Author), Tomas Bata Univ, Zlin, Czech Republic.

In compliance with existing community policies, Romanian strategies in this field seek to provide the necessary support for broadband connectivity in rural areas. The goal of this study is to define a rural end-user profile to plan the most appropriate broadband service strategy from both a technical and a marketing perspective. Our empirical research involves an exploratory survey conducted in rural areas in northwestern Romania (n=1040 respondents). The findings reveal low levels of customer satisfaction and users more interested in data transfer than voice or video applications. Given this rural user profile, simulations of network traffic were conducted. The simulation results suggest that WLANs are the most suitable solution for the ``last mile'' broadband segment.
