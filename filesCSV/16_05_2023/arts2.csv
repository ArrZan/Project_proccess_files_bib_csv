Journal Article|article|10|Kahan M,Rock E|The hanging chads of corporate voting|Georgetown Law Journal|Q2|52|2008|96|4|1227-1281|||2008|||0016-8092|||Never has voting been more important in corporate law. With greater activism among shareholders and the shift from plurality to majority voting for directors, the number of close votes is rising. But is the basic technology of corporate voting adequate to the task? In this Article, we first examine the incredibly complicated system of U.S. corporate voting, a complexity that is driven by the underlying custodial-ownership structure, by dispersed ownership and large trading volumes, and by the rise in short-selling and derivatives. We identify three ways in which things predictably go wrong: pathologies of complexity; pathologies of ownership; and pathologies of misalignment of interests. We then discuss the current legal treatment of these pathologies and consider a variety of directions for reform, ranging from incremental modifications to fundamental redesign. We show that, absent a fundamental reconstruction of the ownership structure, the existing system will continue to be noisy, imprecise, and disturbingly opaque. The problems with the existing system pose fundamental challenges for both proponents of direct shareholder democracy, who advocate more-extensive voting rights for shareholders, and for proponents of indirect shareholder democracy, who advocate deference to a board of directors, the legitimacy of which ultimately rests on shareholder elections.||cited By 55|Department of Law, New York University Law School; Department of Law and Business; Institute for Law and Economics, University of Pennsylvania Law School|English|
Journal Article|article|12|Yatim P|Board structures and the establishment of a risk management committee by Malaysian listed firms|Journal of Management and Governance|Q2|57|2010|14|1|17-36|Springer New York||2010|||1385-3457|http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10997-009-9089-6|10.1007/s10997-009-9089-6|The purpose of this study is to examine the association between the establishment of a risk management committee and board structures of Malaysian listed firms. The study predicts that more independent, expert, and diligent boards are likely to establish a stand-alone risk management committee. It employs a cross-sectional analysis of 690 firms listed on the Bursa Malaysia for the financial year ending in 2003. Multiple regression analysis is used to estimate the relationships proposed in the hypotheses. The study finds a strong support for an association between the establishment of a risk management committee and strong board structures. Specifically, the result shows that firms with higher proportions of non-executive directors on boards and firms that separate the positions of chief executive officers and board chairs are likely to set up a stand-alone risk management committee. Firms with greater board expertise and board diligence are also likely to establish a risk management committee. These findings suggest that stronger boards demonstrate their commitment to and awareness of improved internal control environment. Finally, the study also documents a positive and significant association between firm size, complexity of a firm's operations, and the use of Big Four audit firms with the establishment of a risk management committee. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.||cited By 54|School of Business Management, Faculty of Economics and Business, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 43600 Bangi Selangor, Malaysia|English|

This paper seeks to determine if the theory of cyclical board behavior can provide insight into the evolution of co-operative boards within food co-operatives in Ontario, Canada. To answer these questions managers from food co- operatives participated in a one-hour long, semi- structured interview providing their understanding of the governance within their co-operatives. Managers identified board member engagement, the changing role of the board and succession planning as issues of concern. Engagement level of board members varied from a lack of participation to overbearing participation, which caused tensions within the co-operative. Current governance theories do not appear to adequately explain governance within a co-operative structure. A single, universal governance framework does not address the complexities of a member owned firm. The cyclical board behavior, however, does provide insight into co-operative board evolution. © 2016 The AuthorsAnnals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2016 CIRIEC||cited By 10|University of Winnipeg, Canada; University of Guelph, Canada; Wilfrid Laurier University, Canada|English|
Journal Article|article|40|Vij M|The emerging importance of risk management and enterprise risk management strategies in the Indian hospitality industry: Senior managements’ perspective|Worldwide Hospitality and Tourism Themes|Q2|28|2019|11|4|392-403|Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.||2019|||1755-4217|http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/WHATT-04-2019-0023|10.1108/WHATT-04-2019-0023|Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss the outlook for risk management and enterprise risk management (ERM) within the hospitality sector including how ERM is being balanced with the need to innovate, and what boards of directors are doing to become more engaged in risk oversight. The implementation of ERM is about taking a strategic view of risk and linking it to business goals and value creation. Design/methodology/approach: An interviewer-administered survey was used to collect data from 33 senior risk professionals and other industry experts who had a clear understanding of both risk management and ERM. A structured and semi- structured questionnaire consisting of three sections was personally administered to 33 respondents in 2018 to collect information from risk professionals and other industry experts. Findings: It is important to create a culture of risk awareness and to incorporate risk planning into business decisions. The complexity of modern business necessitates that managers in the hospitality sector have greater skill levels than ever before. This research should help hospitality managers to better understand the core risks and link them to strategy. ERM creates an environment where the organization as a whole can support the value creation process with a sharper focus on risk management. Practical implications: The growing role of technology along with human connections is shaping the hospitality sector and redefining the travel ecosystem. Future travel experiences are likely to be influenced by a blend of technology and human experiences. Many Indian companies are applying the traditional risk management model in their businesses, while ERM is their future goal. The evolution from a traditional risk management model to ERM is challenging, and so it is important to have an appropriate framework in place for its implementation. Originality/value: Hospitality managers need to know how to proactively manage risk management and ERM as the sector is increasingly vulnerable to internal risks. ERM creates a direct linkage between risks and opportunities required for decision-making in a dynamic environment. With growing competition on a global level, the hospitality industry should aim to manage risks strategically to increase the likelihood that organizational objectives can be achieved. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.||cited By 9|Faculty of Management Studies, University of Delhi, New Delhi, India|English|

Examining a sample of 709 firm-year observations of Spanish listed companies spanning the period 2004-2012, our results indicate that the association between firm performance and top management team pay dispersion is conditional on the effectiveness of corporate governance. High top management team pay dispersion is associated with better performance in owner- controlled firms, where more effective monitoring is exerted by the board of directors.

Previous research drawing from the managerial power theory and ‘increased career risks’ perspective offer alternative arguments for how low and high levels of effective monitoring by boards of directors influence CEO compensation. Adopting a configurational approach using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, we explore the idea that there are multiple causal paths leading to high levels of CEO compensation, such that theoretical logic from both theories may be relevant contingent upon the institutional environment in which the relationship is embedded. Our findings in a sample of 38 countries suggest that high CEO compensation is an outcome of both the presence and absence of effective board monitoring depending upon how it combines with minority investor protections and the cultural dimensions of power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and individualism, as well as the overall stock market value. Specifically, in countries with high levels of effective board monitoring, high CEO compensation will be more likely when the country’s culture is high in uncertainty avoidance, low in power distance and when there are strong protections for minority investors. Whereas in countries with low levels of effective board monitoring, high CEO compensation will be more likely when power distance is high and uncertainty avoidance is low and when there are weak protections for minority investors. Our country-level study highlights the theoretical strengths of employing a configurational approach to explore the complex interrelationships of governance mechanisms and the contexts in which they manifest. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.||cited By 8|College of Business, University of Wyoming, 1000 E.

Two alternative and sharply contrasting theorizations, one collective and collaborative (the work of Berle and Means), the other individualistic and contractual (agency theory and shareholder value) are focused upon. The explanatory potential of Blair and Stout's team production theory is elaborated, and its conception of the complexity of business enterprise, with a mediating hierarch (the board of directors) securing a balance between the interests of different stakeholders. The potential for reform of corporate purpose, corporate governance and directors' duties is examined with reference to the UK Modern Company Law Review. The impact of the intensification of the financialization of corporations is analysed, with the increased emphasis upon short-termism. The origins of the global financial crisis in shareholder value orientations and the continuing reverberations of the crisis are explored. Finally, the imperative of the advance of sustainable enterprise is argued, and the critical changes necessitated in corporate purpose and directors' duties.

In conjunction with Amec Foster Wheeler, the Jansen project team developed a model of the Jansen production and logistics chain to understand the drivers of production capacity. The Detailed Integrated Capacity Estimate model (DICE) is a comprehensive discrete-event simulation model of Jansen's upstream production (mining, hoisting, and ore processing) and downstream logistics (rail, port, and marketing). DICE provides an unprecedented combination of complexity, granularity, and scalability, which informs ore storage capacities, product sizing infrastructure, critical-equipment redundancies, bypasses, and operational practices. The team used DICE during the prefeasibility study of the Jansen project. The model provided the justification for the removal of about $300 million in capital expenses to equip the second of two hoisting shafts, the reduction of planned maintenance, and the increase of the degree of mining automation. Throughout the prefeasibility study, Jansen's annual production in stage 1 of operations was estimated to increase by 15-20 percent, with two-thirds of this gain credited to DICE. This potential additional production added $500 million to the net present value of Jansen stage 1. In consideration of this, among other factors, the BHP board of directors approved the transition of the Jansen project from a prefeasibility to a feasibility study. © 2018 INFORMS.||cited By 7|BHP, Saskatoon, SK S7K 1L3, Canada; Amec Foster Wheeler, Environment and Infrastructure Division, Burnaby, BC V5C 0E4, Canada|English|

Design/methodology/approachThis paper highlights the active participation of the board in firm internationalisation using a sample of 78 Spanish firms quoted on Madrid Stock Exchange. The authors used a longitudinal analysis from 2005 through 2010. FindingsThe results show that while the resources provided by the directors through their level of education and international experience, help them learn and process information, and they are a source of expertise representing “board potential”;. A board that functions well through the directors’ relationships allow the proper integration and use of these resources, and helps create sustainable competitive advantages in an international context.

Findings: This paper presents the main causes and consequences of complexity in corporate disclosures and identifies four disclosure writing styles: obfuscation, informativeness, deception and avoidance. This paper suggests that firms concerned about the readability of their communications use a balanced strategy and proposes some practical actions for its implementation. Originality/value: This paper makes several contributions by offering insights into questions that should be raised by top management and the board of directors, including: Why care about readability?

Taking a middle management perspective, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the experiences of Richard, a newly appointed professional youth football Academy Manager during the process of organizational change. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, formal academy team meetings, co-worker interviews, and informal observations and conversations, which were analyzed through the process of narrative analysis. Findings highlighted the hierarchical sensemaking challenges of vertically ‘managing up’ (e.g. Chairman, Board of Directors, 1st Team Manager) and ‘managing down’ (e.g. academy employees), and horizontally ‘managing across’ (e.g. Head of Coaching) during the process of organizational change. Importantly, managing expectations and influencing significant others, through skilled micro-political activity, was central to successfully negotiating the ambiguity and vulnerabilities of organizational life during change. MAD statement This study is the first to examine the micro-political actions and behaviours of middle managers as both recipients and deliverers of organizational change. The self-interests of middle-managers tend to influence strategic change; however, we do not understand how middle-managers make sense of the micro-political nature of such interests during change. This study highlights the complexity of coping with employment vulnerability when negotiating and influencing the actions of senior management whilst also supporting subordinate staff with resistance and uncertainty during change. Furthermore, the micro-political actions and strategies of a middle-manager to develop ‘trust’ amongst colleagues, both vertically ‘above’ and ‘below’ them, and horizontally ‘across’ from them in the organizational hierarchy, are evidenced. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.||cited By 3|Sport, Outdoor and Exercise Science, University of Derby, Derby, United Kingdom; Department of Exercise & Sport Science, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, United Kingdom|English|

While there is a widespread opposition to staggered boards among U.S. scholars and investors - being such device a powerful antitakeover measure in the American legal system since directors belonging to a U.S. staggered board may be removed only ""for cause"" - this Article explains the reasons why staggered boards should be implemented by Italian banks and public companies considering the significant distinctions between the U.S. and the European legal frameworks in this area. Taking into account the new banking governance principles recently introduced by CRD IV and by its implementing measures, this Article explains how the establishment of staggered boards by Italian credit institutions and listed companies may allow them (i) to exclude the risk of potential discontinuities in the management's action, which are inappropriate in corporations of such complexity and systemic relevance, (ii) to facilitate the initial induction and training of the newly appointed directors and officers, who would benefit from the expertise of other members of the board with longer experience, (iii) to strengthen and foster the institutional dialogue between the board and the shareholders, aimed at achieving an adequate collective knowledge, skills and experience of the management body, and finally (iv) to attract more capital from professional investors, granting them the possibility to appoint their representatives in the board on an annual basis."||cited By 1|LINK Campus University of Rome, Italy|English|

This paper seeks to examine the legal, tax, and accounting issues that have evolved because of these suspect illegal activities. Design/methodology/approach The author presents the theory behind performance-based compensation that is the basis for employee stock option grants. The author then examines regulations, judicial theory, and court cases to determine the current legal status of backdating, spring loading, or bullet dodging of executive stock option grants. Findings The current legal environment has made it difficult for executives to continue the practice of manipulating stock option grants without falling under the ire of regulators and shareholders. However, a question remains whether executives that manipulated stock option grants in the past will be found criminally liable for their acts. Practical implications The paper's review of the discourse on the legality of corporate executives enhancing their compensation packages shows the complexity of detecting and regulating this type of suspect activity. Originality/value This paper presents a contemporaneous discussion and data on legal and regulatory changes that resulted from management malfeasance of executive compensation. © Copyright - 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Journal Article|article|87|Alajmi A,Worthington AC|Corporate governance in Kuwait: joining the dots between regulatory reform, organisational change in boards and audit committees and firm market and accounting performance|Journal of Financial Reporting and Accounting|Q2|16|2023||||Emerald Publishing||2023|||1985-2517|http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/JFRA-04-2022-0133|10.1108/JFRA-04-2022-0133|Purpose: This study aims to examine the link between boards and audit committees and firm performance in Kuwaiti listed firms in the context of recent and extensive corporate governance regulatory reform. Design/methodology/approach: Panel data regression analysis with fixed effects and clustered standard errors of firm performance for 61–97 listed industrial and services firms in Kuwait over a seven-year period. The dependent variables are the returns on assets and equity, the debt-to-equity ratio and leverage and Tobin’s Q and the independent variables comprise board of directors and audit committee characteristics, including size, the number of meetings and the numbers of independent and outside board and expert committee members. Firm size, subsidiary status and cash flow serve as control variables. Findings: Mixed results with respect to the characteristics of the board of directors. Board size and independent and outsider board members positively relate only to Tobin’s Q and insiders only to debt to equity. For audit committee characteristics, committee size, independence and expertise positively relate to the return on equity and committee size and expertise only to Tobin’s Q. Of the five performance measures considered, board and audit committee characteristics together best determine Tobin’s Q. Research limitations/implications: Data from a single country limits generalisability and control variables necessarily limited in a developing market context. Need for qualitative insights into corporate governance reform as a complement to conventional quantitative analysis. In combining accounting and market information, Tobin’s Q appears best able to recognise the performance benefits of good corporate governance in terms of internal organisational change. Practical implications: The recent corporate governance code and guidelines reforms exert a mixed impact on firm performance, with audit committees, not boards, of most influence. But recent reforms implied most change to boards of directors. One suggestion is that non- market reform may have been unneeded given existing market pressure on listed firms and firms anticipating regulatory change. Social implications: Kuwait’s corporate governance reforms codified corporate governance practices already in place among many of its firms in pursuit of organisational legitimacy, and while invoking substantial change to audit committees, involved minor change to firm performance, at least in the short term.

The nexus of bank governance is the board of directors, but they have proven inadequate in controlling the riskiness of bank activities, an outcome due both of the complexity of modern banks, and because boards are uncertain about what is expected of them. Using an interdisciplinary approach from law and accounting, we propose a two- step procedure to improve bank governance. First, we give bank directors an explicit standard to assess the outcome of their actions: the Prudent Investor rule which is the requirement for trusts. Adopting the Prudent Investor rule would return to director's responsibility to control the risks of banking activities. To enforce the higher standard, we propose to use disclosure as a disciplining mechanism. We base the new disclosure regime on Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that requires managers to implement controls over the firm's financial reporting processes and to publicly attest to their effectiveness. This section failed to prevent the credit crisis because it was too narrowly focused. We recommend that the provision be broadened to encompass governance controls in general, and that responsibility for disclosure be placed on the bank board rather than on managers. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.||cited By 0|Rutgers Business School, Department of Accounting and Information Systems, Newark, NJ 07102-3122, United States|English|

Design/methodology/approachPanel data regression analysis with fixed effects and clustered standard errors of firm performance for 61-97 listed industrial and services firms in Kuwait over a seven-year period. The dependent variables are the returns on assets and equity, the debt-to-equity ratio and leverage and Tobin's Q and the independent variables comprise board of directors and audit committee characteristics, including size, the number of meetings and the numbers of independent and outside board and expert committee members. Firm size, subsidiary status and cash flow serve as control variables. FindingsMixed results with respect to the characteristics of the board of directors. Board size and independent and outsider board members positively relate only to Tobin's Q and insiders only to debt to equity. For audit committee characteristics, committee size, independence and expertise positively relate to the return on equity and committee size and expertise only to Tobin's Q. Of the five performance measures considered, board and audit committee characteristics together best determine Tobin's Q. Research limitations/implicationsData from a single country limits generalisability and control variables necessarily limited in a developing market context. Need for qualitative insights into corporate governance reform as a complement to conventional quantitative analysis. In combining accounting and market information, Tobin's Q appears best able to recognise the performance benefits of good corporate governance in terms of internal organisational change. Practical implicationsThe recent corporate governance code and guidelines reforms exert a mixed impact on firm performance, with audit committees, not boards, of most influence. But recent reforms implied most change to boards of directors. One suggestion is that non- market reform may have been unneeded given existing market pressure on listed firms and firms anticipating regulatory change. Social implicationsKuwait's corporate governance reforms codified corporate governance practices already in place among many of its firms in pursuit of organisational legitimacy, and while invoking substantial change to audit committees, involved minor change to firm performance, at least in the short term. Some firms may also have delisted in expectation of stronger corporate governance requirements. Regardless, these direct and indirect processes both improved the overall quality of listed firm corporate governance and performance in Kuwait.

The corporate excesses of the 1970s sparked a search for market mechanisms and disclosure to empower shareholders. The UK-focused problems of the 1990s prompted board-centric, structural approaches, while the fall of Enron and many other companies in the early 2000s heightened emphasis on director independence and professionalism. With the financial crisis of 2007-09, however, came a turn in some policy approaches and in academic literature seeking a different way forward. This paper explores those four phases and the discourse each develops and then links each to assumptions about accountability and cognition. After the financial crisis came pointers n policy and practice away from narrow, rationalist prescriptions and toward what the philosopher Stephen Toulmin calls ``reasonableness''. Acknowledging that heightens awareness of complexity and interdependence in corporate governance practice. The paper then articulates a research agenda concerning what ``reasonably'' good corporate governance might entail.|Corporate governance; Boards of directors; Investors; Rationality; Reasonableness||Nordberg, D (Corresponding Author), Bournemouth Univ, Execut Business Ctr, 89 Holdenhurst Rd, Bournemouth BH8 8EB, Dorset, England.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper highlights the active participation of the board in firm internationalisation using a sample of 78 Spanish firms quoted on Madrid Stock Exchange. The authors used a longitudinal analysis from 2005 through 2010. Findings - The results show that while the resources provided by the directors through their level of education and international experience, help them learn and process information, and they are a source of expertise representing ``board potential''. A board that functions well through the directors' relationships allow the proper integration and use of these resources, and helps create sustainable competitive advantages in an international context. Originality/value - From a RBV, this paper refines and extends the concept of ``board capability'' as the combination of potential and internal relations that allow boards to undertake their roles competently over time. Additionally, the paper empirically examines the effect of board capability on firm internationalisation.|Board of directors; Resource-based view; Firm internationalization||Sanchez, LPC (Corresponding Author), Univ Pablo de Olavide, Org Business & Mkt, Seville, Spain.

Commercial banks claim that credit unions are no different than banks and that the credit union tax exemption represents an unfair competitive advantage. Credit unions counter that while they offer similar products and services, they differ from commercial banks in terms of structure and mission, given their not-for-profit, cooperative status. In this paper, we test for substantive differences in the objective functions of commercial banks and nonprofit credit unions by comparing CEO compensation structures. Drawing on the relevant principal-agent literature, we provide several arguments to support the hypotheses that credit union boards of directors establish lower-powered incentive contracts with their CEOs relative to similarly sized commercial banks, and offer lower total compensation. We find that credit union CEOs receive approximately 250% less performance-based compensation relative to CEOs of similarly sized community banks. Bank CEOs also earn approximately 15% to 20% more total compensation on average. The results are generally robust to controlling for CEO- and board-level characteristics, local economic conditions, and institution-level indicators of size, growth, complexity, liquidity and risk. The findings suggest important differences in incentive structures and objectives between banks and credit unions.|banks; cooperatives; credit unions; executive compensation; principal-agent; prosocial behavior||van Rijn, J (Corresponding Author), Univ Wisconsin, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA. van Rijn, Jordan, Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

In conjunction with Amec Foster Wheeler, the Jansen project team developed a model of the Jansen production and logistics chain to understand the drivers of production capacity. The Detailed Integrated Capacity Estimate model (DICE) is a comprehensive discrete-event simulation model of Jansen's upstream production (mining, hoisting, and ore processing) and downstream logistics (rail, port, and marketing). DICE provides an unprecedented combination of complexity, granularity, and scalability, which informs ore storage capacities, product sizing infrastructure, critical-equipment redundancies, bypasses, and operational practices. The team used DICE during the prefeasibility study of the Jansen project. The model provided the justification for the removal of about $300 million in capital expenses to equip the second of two hoisting shafts, the reduction of planned maintenance, and the increase of the degree of mining automation. Throughout the prefeasibility study, Jansen's annual production in stage 1 of operations was estimated to increase by 15-20 percent, with two-thirds of this gain credited to DICE. This potential additional production added $500 million to the net present value of Jansen stage 1. In consideration of this, among other factors, the BHP board of directors approved the transition of the Jansen project from a prefeasibility to a feasibility study.|models; discrete time; capacity expansion; capital assets; investment; mining; sensitivity analysis; simulation||Bouffard, SC (Corresponding Author), BHP, Saskatoon, SK S7K IL3, Canada.

Design/methodology/approach In the paper, empirical evidence was gathered through documentary sources, non-participant observations and in-depth interviews with members of boards of directors (BoDs), chief executive officers (CEOs), internal and external auditors, senior executives and ministry officials. The data were analyzed using thematic and pattern-matching approaches. Findings The paper shows that bureaucratic and market logics co-exist and variations in governance practices within and across categories of PSEs. These are reflected in CEO appointments, multiple roles of CEOs, board member appointments, board composition, multiple board membership, board roles and evaluation of board performance. External audits also foster market logic in governance practices. The two competing logics are managed by actors through selective coupling, compromise, decoupling and compartmentalization. Despite competing logics, the bureaucratic logic remains dominant and is largely responsible for variations between the underlying logics and governance practices. Practical implications The findings suggest that public-sector reforms in emerging economies (EEs) must account for the fact that governance practices in PSEs are shaped by different institutional logics embedded in socioeconomic, political and organizational contexts and their corresponding management strategies. Originality/value Few previous studies explicitly report relationships between institutional logics and the governance practices of PSEs in EEs.
