As a result, human capital is regarded as the most important asset, and therefore, in order to grow and prosper, SMEs need to embrace the strategic approach to the human resource management (HRM) which should, in return, increase their competitiveness and responsiveness to the market changes. The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of strategic human resource (HR) practices on organisational performance. The results of hierarchical regression used to test the hypothesis supported the relationship between strategic HR practices and business performance. The findings presented in this study were used for making recommendations to the SMEs' managers in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The second pillar of its successfulness is active participation of regional and local self- governments. In this article, we recommend to realise a growth-equalising strategy for the Slovak conditions after the SR accession. The growth- equalising strategy of regional policy should in our conditions: • Support and keep in growth the regional centres (developed agglomerations) that are decisive carriers of national-economy growth and create not only development resources in the Slovak economy but also a pro-growth environment for the equalisation of regions lagging behind; this part of the overall strategy is called growth-equalising strategy focusing on regional centres of national- economy growth (developed regions). These urban agglomerations are concerned: Bratislava - Trnava, Trenčín, Žilina - Martin, Poprad, Košice - Prešov and Banská Bystrica - Zvolen and the region of the city of Nitra. • Remove negative consequences of production decrement and adaptation to the new market conditions in the regions lagging behind, together with the support of localisation, revitalisation of the regions with deformed demographic and professional structure (the threat of social and economic degradation and marginalisation). This part of the overall strategy is called growth-equalising strategy focusing on regional centres in regions lagging behind. Urban centres must be the carriers of development also in such regions. In NUTS II. Western Slovakia the development of agglomeration Nové Zámky - Komárno is concerned, in the region of Central Slovakia - the development of the towns of Lučenec - Rimavská Sobota and in the East Slovakia region the development of the agglomeration Humenné - Vranov. • Both parts of the overall strategy should be implemented with a non-scattered concentrating model. The practice of regional development proved sufficiently that dispersing of funds, ""strewing"" an area with investments is a short term solution failing to provide long term changes of regional structures. In order to pursue effective use of national resources and, in particular, resources from the EU structural funds, the assumption that in the first after-accession stage (approximately 10 - 12 years) these funds will be absorbed by those cities and agglo-meration that dispose of decisive localisation advantages even today, is realistic. Preferring the growth-equalising strategy in its proposed concentrating form in the first stage after EU accession does not mean that the smaller regions out of the reach of the agglomeration development effects shall be excluded from the support. In terms of competitiveness changes till the year 2010, human resources, foreign direct investments, innovations, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and infrastructure, are analysed. According to model calculations the consequences of individual policies shall result until 2010, depending on the selected scenario, in changes in the competitiveness of the regions and GDP per capita development following the individual NUTS II and Slovak regions. Slovakia would approach 72.7 per cent of the EU 25 average forecast for 2010 (currently it is around 53 per cent). With the exception of the region of Bratislava (164.7 per cent) and partly the region of Trnava (74.3 per cent), Slovak regions would achieve values under 75 per cent of EU 25 GDP per capita. The knowledge gained by developed and also cohesion countries, however, shows that mostly the developed scope of regional institutions (including on the one hand institutions necessary for the functioning of the support mechanism and on the other hand institutions supporting transfer of technology and innovation, improving qualification, etc.) can, in particular, affect significantly the sustainability and triggering of regionnal growth. Particularly, the necessity to develop capacities needed for EU membership rises in the pre-accession period. This has resulted from the evaluation of the current situation of the Slovak public administration and ensuring the equalisation of the difference between this situation and the situation required from all EU Member States - existing as well as the new ones. With respect to Slovakia's interest to achieve EU membership in the year 2004 the building of effective and capable capacities for membership is a strategic priority."|economic growth; economic integration; European Union; regional economy, Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Slovakia|cited By 4|Ekon. univerzita v Bratislave, Narodohospodárska fakulta, Katedra reg. rozvoja geografie, Dolnozemská cesta 1, Bratislava 5 852 35, Slovakia|Slovak|

This poses a significant challenge to manufacturing Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the funds and human resources to invest in staff training, and translates into a distinct need to provide comprehensive A&R upskilling and training programs in the form of smart learning solutions designed to enable SME personnel to pursue their training goals in a flexible, customizable and easy- to-access way.

By building on the literature of digital marketplace and business models we argue that the features of the context shape the type of the business models applicable for digital marketplaces. We suggest that before designing a digital marketplace initiative it is necessary to undertake a context assessment that ensures a better understanding of the firms' preparedness to the usage of this kind of platforms in terms of technological infrastructure, human resources' capabilities and skills, integration and innovation level among firms. It is essential to start with feasible initiatives and build up steadily the qualifications necessary for facing hindrances. However, starting at the right point and in the right way doesn't automatically guarantee success and competitive advantage of SMEs, but can represent a way to start admitting the fundamental role of the innovation in a high complex environment. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.|Business models; Competitive advantage; Complex environments; Digital marketplace; SMEs; Technological infrastructure, Competition; Developing countries; Electronic commerce, Industry|cited By 2; Conference of 6th International Joint Conference on e-Business and Telecommunications, ICETE 2009 ; Conference Date: 7 July 2009 Through 10 July 2009; Conference Code:94936|University of Salento, via Monteroni, s.n., 73100, Lecce, Italy|English|

For the purpose of this study, literature review has been conducted with particular focus on high-quality journals with a proven influence in the HRM and Innovation field. Concerning the research strategy, 23 papers published in Q1 and Q2 ranked journals (SJR) were analyzed, as well as 6 other sources inlcuding books, books proceedings and journals (not ranked in Scopus or WoS databases). Our findings support the development of an integrated approach that not only takes into account early investment into HR systems, but also considers how macroeconomic factors might influence the industry directly, and start-ups indirectly and incongruously. This integrated perspective maintains that human capital acquisition and the implementation of adequate HR policies and practices that support employee engagement and retention early on are significantly more beneficial to company performance and productivity in the longer run; whereas, at the same time exhibiting a high degree of flexibility and adaptability to business-and sector-specific preconditions and requirements. We argue that future research should concentrate on the industry as a factor determining the HR strategy to be adopted by start-ups, as opposed to debating which approach is more appropriate for start-ups without taking into account their operational environment.|Start-up; Human Resource Systems; Innovation; Business Development; High-Performance||cera, E (Corresponding Author), Tomas Bata Univ, Zlin, Czech Republic.
